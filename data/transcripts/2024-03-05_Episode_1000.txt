[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.660]   Winter Lives Here!
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:50.980]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we celebrate Episode 1000.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.140]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:11.620]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life in a planned
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:24.900]   room of financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:41.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I am your host, and today on the show, we are going to celebrate
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.860]   a little bit together, because as long time listeners know, Episode 1000 is an important
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.280]   milestone for me in the history of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   Why you may ask?
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.980]   Well, because if you go back in the very beginning of this podcast, back to the very first episodes,
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.800]   you will find in Episode 11, I believe it is, that I committed to doing a thousand episodes
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.540]   of this podcast.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.060]   And I said in the very beginning that I'll do a thousand episodes of this podcast, whether
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020]   anyone listens or not.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.660]   And thankfully, I'm quite grateful that many people have chosen to listen.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.140]   That's an honor, and I'm grateful for that, because while I'd like to talk tough and say
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.580]   that I would have followed through on that, whether or not anybody listened, that was
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.240]   my intention and that was what I planned to do, but it certainly would not have been as
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   easy to get to Episode 1000 as it was to get here with having listeners and having people
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.300]   knowing that I'm making a difference, knowing, getting so many nice letters from so many
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.380]   of you, etc. has made it much, much easier to get to Episode 1000.
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.940]   That's not to say it has been easy.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.940]   It has not been easy.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.300]   It has required a significant amount of determination from me, and I'm proud of that.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.740]   What I thought we would do today, there are many things that I was considering, how could
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.160]   we celebrate Episode 1000?
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.400]   Over the months, I've had various big plans.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   Originally, my goal was to do a cross-country tour and have meetups all around the United
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.440]   States and perhaps all around the world.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.240]   I had to put those plans on hold.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.720]   I couldn't quite bring them to fruition.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.800]   Maybe we'll be able to do them.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.160]   We are having a family camp, which in my mind is a celebration of more in-person events,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   something I've been wanting to accomplish.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.160]   Of course, in Episode 500, I played many of your wonderful notes and audios and things
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.640]   like that, but I thought what would be most interesting for me and for you would be just
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.400]   to use Episode 1000 and reflect a little bit on the milestone and share with you a few
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.200]   of the lessons that I have learned from this experience, because in my own life, doing
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:05.920]   radical personal finance was one of the most significant events in my life, because it
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   was one of the most significant times in which I believed in myself and I charted my own
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.280]   path.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.200]   I did it in the face of quite a lot of, not opposition, that wouldn't be fair to say,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   but just lack of people really understanding.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.740]   Yet for me, as a man, making a decision, saying this is something I want to do, I'm going
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.840]   to do it even when it's uncertain and here's what I'm going to do.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.560]   It's going to be a significant investment of time, resources, et cetera, may or may
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.840]   not work out and has enormous possibilities of failure, has some slight possibilities
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.180]   of success, it's outside of areas that I can predict, it's not predictable, but it's something
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.320]   that I want to do and I'm going to do it.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:09.180]   That is something that for me has been extremely transformative in my life and in my character.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:19.980]   When I reflect upon that, I can clearly chart the decision to pursue radical personal finance
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.820]   as a dividing point in my life.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.260]   I don't want to be hyperbolic.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.360]   This is not hyperbole.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.860]   If it is hyperbole, it's only a little bit, but making the decision to pursue radical
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.520]   personal finance was for me a very large decision where I had to believe in myself, and I hadn't
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.320]   done a lot of that previously.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.240]   It's not a sob story.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   I've lived a very privileged and charmed life.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.160]   I have nothing but blessings in my life, but there comes a time in a man's life, in any
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160]   man's life, in which he has to make a decision, a decision as to what he's going to do, why
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.420]   he's going to do it, and he has to make that decision on his own.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.720]   But when he finally does that, it seems to me that whether it's a success or whether
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.680]   it's a failure, it has good effects, good effects in a man's life.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.100]   It's something that I'm quite proud of because it has spurred me to make more of those decisions.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.140]   As I reflect, there were other decisions that I made prior to starting radical personal
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.340]   finance, of course, many other decisions that I made that were also in that similar vein.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.220]   But those decisions often seemed relatively small and relatively safe.
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.240]   I can think of some of them.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.680]   For example, when I graduated from college, I decided I was going to go and travel around
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.280]   the United States.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.520]   I set off by myself.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   I didn't have a job.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.000]   I didn't have any clear plans.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.640]   I had a little bit of money saved up.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.960]   But I went off and I traveled all around the United States in my old cheap car, and that
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   was something that I did all by myself.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.480]   It was challenging for me, but it was also a great experience that I really enjoyed.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.560]   And I started to experience the joy of having to rely on myself, and I saw how that decision
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.940]   impacted me.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.160]   There were other decisions when I became an entrepreneur after getting laid off from my
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.240]   corporate job that I had after college.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.840]   Then I had to go and be an entrepreneur, but it was still relatively safe in the sense
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.740]   that I wasn't bearing responsibility.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.460]   But radical personal finance was different because I was bearing more responsibility
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.020]   when I decided to do that.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.140]   So let me lay out the story for so many of you who were not there in the early days because
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:43.180]   I think you'll find some of the inside history interesting.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.240]   After I graduated college, I worked for a short time in a large corporate marketing
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.820]   and brand management consulting company.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.900]   And it was a company that I had started working for during college, and they had provided
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.840]   me the opportunity to have a flexible work schedule when I was in college so that I could
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.500]   finish my college work.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.740]   And in exchange, they asked me to consider working for them after college.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.920]   So when I graduated, I went and said, "Okay, I graduated.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.560]   Do you have another job for me?"
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.680]   And basically they said, "No, we don't."
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.980]   And I didn't want to keep working in the relatively low-level job that I was working
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.980]   in.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.980]   So I quit.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.860]   But as I was quitting on the way out, then they said, "Hey, listen, we'd hate to
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.440]   lose you as an employee.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.720]   Come back to us in a little time."
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.160]   And that was actually when I went traveling.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.120]   I loaded up my car and traveled all around the United States by myself in an old, old,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.960]   tiny, cheap car.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.040]   And then I went back and saw my boss when I got back, and they offered me a job.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.200]   And the job came with a nice pay raise.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.740]   It came to a new set of duties and to a new job that they had set up into the company.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.600]   And they hired me and then two other ladies into the same position.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.680]   So I worked for that company for, I think, a year or so.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.560]   And I was doing it—I didn't like the job.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.240]   I didn't enjoy the job at all, but I was doing it because I felt like I was fulfilling
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   a commitment.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.300]   They had given me some extra scholarship money for college in exchange for my considering
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.840]   working for them, and so I thought I would work for them.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.600]   My plan was to work for them for a year and then to quit.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:25.280]   And so my planned quitting date was January of 2009 that I had decided I was going to
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   move on to something else.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.080]   I didn't have a clear idea or goal of what else I wanted to do, but I was going to quit
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.860]   in January of 2009.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.240]   In June of 2008, I got called into my boss's office and I got laid off, totally out of
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.720]   the blue, didn't expect it.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.880]   And I had just gotten a pay raise, I thought everything was going great, I thought here
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.720]   I am doing something I don't want to do to satisfy corporate loyalty, and I got laid
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   off.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.520]   And I didn't exactly know what to do.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.640]   So I was looking around, considering options.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.760]   And then a few weeks later, I had lunch with one of my supervisors—I think it was the
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.880]   vice president or something—the guy had laid me off.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.300]   And we were having lunch, and I was sharing with him a little bit of vision that I had
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   of what I wanted to do.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   And he suggested to me that I consider going into the world of financial services.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.040]   And at the time, I was a personal finance aficionado, but I had no interest in the world
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.480]   of professional financial services.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.660]   Being a personal finance aficionado, I had developed an intense skepticism towards financial
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.240]   advisors, the financial advisor industry, all of the scams, all of the worthless financial
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.540]   products, et cetera.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:41.440]   And I had pretty much become a boglehead, and I was a by-term investor difference, I
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.080]   was a Dave Ramsey guy, I was a boglehead, pretty through and through, and didn't have
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.020]   much interest in financial services.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:54.800]   But this guy's son had been a college intern doing the college intern program at Northwestern
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:00.720]   Mutual, which is a large life insurance company and now large financial services conglomerate.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.840]   And they'd had good experiences, and so he referred me in, and I went in for an interview.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.480]   And I went in pretty skeptical.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.220]   I did a little research, found out that Northwestern Mutual was basically the whole life insurance
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.220]   king.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.860]   And so half of my first interview, I spent grilling the Northwestern guy about whole
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.800]   life insurance and what use does this possibly have, et cetera.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:29.120]   And after that, though, I liked him, and I liked how he was able to respond to my questions.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.440]   He was a thoughtful analytical guy.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.120]   The guy that I interviewed with was a retired Navy guy, engineer, very analytical guy, really
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.720]   enjoyed the interaction.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.000]   So I started interviewing, went through the whole round of interviews, interviewed with
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.340]   a couple of other companies, and basically I realized, you know what, I've always wanted
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.960]   to learn to sell, and this would be a good chance for me to learn to sell.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.800]   And I don't have much of something that's better, and if I do this and I learn to sell,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.960]   I'll be really grateful for that, even if I don't do this for the long term.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.280]   And I had found enough discussions and arguments and information about financial products that
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.600]   I realized that I was overall fairly ignorant of the financial space, and I didn't think
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.360]   that I was going to have an ethical issue working in the financial services industry
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.440]   as long as I was careful, so I joined the company, Northwestern Mutual.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   And I'm glad that I did, because the time that I joined the industry was during the
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.680]   stock collapse and basically economic collapse of 2008.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.260]   I was driving to my insurance licensing course in Miami every day, listening, at the time
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:46.680]   I was an inveterate NPR listener, so I would listen to NPR all the time, back and forth,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.640]   and here I am listening to the world collapse as I head into the financial services industry,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.160]   and that was when I began.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.200]   As I began, I did fairly well in the industry, I was never a real star, but I was always
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.760]   a solid producer, and over the years I invested quite heavily into learning more about financial
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.640]   services because I got into the business more with an interest in finance and personal finance
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:19.880]   rather than being entirely focused on making a fortune for myself, I was focused on education.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.120]   And I would still love to listen to talk radio, I never listened to music, I still really
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.760]   don't, and so I listened to talk radio, and then this was the early days of podcasting,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.320]   I had started listening to podcasts in college, and so I would listen to hours and hours and
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.280]   hours of podcasts.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.040]   And as I learned and studied, over time I became a chartered life underwriter and a
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.000]   chartered financial consultant and a certified financial planner, and about four or five
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.020]   other designations, I ultimately started pursuing a master's degree in financial services, and
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.640]   ultimately finished that, and as I grew to learn more and more, I found that I couldn't
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.120]   really enjoy financial media the way that I once did.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.900]   And I just, the biggest frustration in my life was when I'd be sitting at a table talking
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.800]   to somebody about finance and they would say, "Well Dave Ramsey says such and such, or Suze
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.700]   Orman says such and such," and I just got annoyed that it seemed like Dave Ramsey could
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.000]   spend more time speaking to my clients than I could, and I thought, "Well Dave Ramsey
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.740]   doesn't know anything about financial planning, he's saying this is this that's wrong, this
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.720]   that's wrong, this that's wrong, and Dave's not looking at it from this perspective and
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.060]   that perspective and the other perspective, and after all, I should be the guy who is
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.240]   doing this."
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.360]   And so as I observed this, and I became aware, I started listening to a couple of podcasts
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.160]   about podcasting, and I thought, you know what, it's probably not that hard, I should
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.340]   start a podcast.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:50.120]   And the challenge is that being in a regulated industry, I figured, you know what, I'm not
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.040]   sure if I can do this, and I tried to look into the laws, I tried to, I spoke to a couple
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.940]   of lawyers, and I thought I had found a solution, I thought that, you know what, I could start
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:09.840]   a podcast if I could do it and not make wrong, forward-looking statements and absurd claims
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.480]   and things like that, and I just did it anonymously, I didn't tell people I was a financial advisor,
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.320]   then I could start a podcast, and then I would have the ability to say to my clients, "Hey,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.020]   listen to this, I did a podcast on this subject, here's an hour of me teaching about this thing.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.660]   One of the things that annoyed me as a financial advisor was that, in essence, you have to
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.980]   have the same conversations very repetitively.
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.340]   And I just grew really frustrated with it, I thought, why do I have to have this conversation
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.840]   again and again, why can't I just send somebody a video that I make or an audio file that
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.520]   I make and explain, hey, listen to this, and then you'll know everything about, there's
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.300]   these 10 questions you're going to ask me, and I'm going to answer all these upfront,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.160]   but I'm going to do it in a way that's going to be really time-effective.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.520]   And of course, I didn't have to start a podcast to do that, I could have just recorded those
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.920]   audio files and done it, but I wasn't smart enough to actually follow through and do that
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.080]   at the time, I didn't test it and see how it would work.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:16.120]   So I decided I would start a podcast, and so in 2013, I sat down in my spare bedroom
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.920]   with a cheap little voice recorder that I had gotten with my Dragon Naturally Speaking
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.280]   subscription and recorded episode one of Radical Personal Finance, and I have still kept it
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   in the podcast feed.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   So if you're interested in listening to episode one, it is still there.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.720]   And it's available and you can hear it, it was just me talking, basically giving my frustrations
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.520]   and my vision of what I thought a good financial podcast could be and what I was going to try
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.560]   to do.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.100]   Then I worked through all the tech of figuring out how to launch it, and then I started recording
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.820]   more podcast episodes, so I wound up in the first three weeks, I recorded 10 episodes,
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:55.160]   and I found that I really loved doing it, I felt like it was good.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.400]   After I had recorded episode one, I went back and listened to it, and I basically just asked
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.800]   myself the question, would I listen to that?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.900]   And after all, here I am as a guy who listens to huge amounts of talk radio and podcasts
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.000]   and things like that, and I recognized that, yeah, I would listen to that, it wasn't terrible,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.420]   it kept my interest.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.720]   And so I said, "Well, good enough for me, let's keep going."
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.620]   So I recorded 10 episodes of the podcast in the first three weeks, figured out how to
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.540]   get a logo, figured out how to get an RSS feed online, did all the stuff, and was just
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.180]   getting going.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.020]   During that time, again, I had spoken with a lawyer at the home office and I thought,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:35.980]   "Okay, I need to go ahead and make sure they know about it, I've got the legal standing
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.980]   here."
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.940]   So then I submitted an outside business activity form to my chief compliance officer, letting
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.540]   her know what I was doing.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:49.700]   I get a phone call, and she basically says, "Joshua, are you crazy?
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.820]   What on earth are you doing?
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.740]   How could you possibly think that this is something that you're allowed to do?
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.360]   What is wrong with you?
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.280]   Take that thing off the internet, you can't have this on the internet."
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.840]   And basically, I was given an ultimatum of either take it off the internet or you're
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   done here today.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.860]   Well, at the time, my wife was six months pregnant with our first baby, and I had spent
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.760]   six years building a financial planning business that was finally profitable, was finally working,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.920]   I was finally making money, it wasn't that hard, I was pretty good at it, and I had no
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:25.900]   idea of what to do with a podcast, it was just kind of an interest of mine.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.780]   And so I took it down.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.940]   And I remember that being an enormous emotional crisis for me.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:40.340]   I remember writing Cliff Ravenscraft, the podcast answer man, this emotional email of,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:45.100]   "Here's my thing, I don't know what to do," and just kind of dealing with it.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.680]   And it took me a while to calm down a little bit and just deal with the emotions of it.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.420]   And I just decided to try to think, "Well, what's going on here?"
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.040]   And I started to look at the number of people who had downloaded the podcast, I had a few
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.020]   emails by them, and then I started to do a little research and I realized that, hey,
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.600]   a lot of people had actually started listening to the podcast, that the initial download
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.680]   numbers were pretty healthy, and people were interested in what I had to say, which was
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.100]   very, which was pretty cool.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.240]   And more importantly, I had found that I really loved the experience of recording it.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.700]   All during those first three weeks, it was an obsession.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.820]   I was getting up at four o'clock in the morning, working late at night, recording the podcast,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.140]   just loving every minute of it, and I realized that was a real obsession of mine to talk
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.140]   about this.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.080]   And I imagined all the different things that it would be interesting to dig into, that
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.440]   you can't dig into in the life of a normal everyday financial advisor.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.060]   But I had no plan.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.520]   And so it took me about six months to become convinced that this was something that I wanted
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.180]   to pursue.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.380]   And then the problem was that I had no plan.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.720]   And podcasting was just a crapshoot.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.600]   There was no way to know how to make money on it, because basically I became convinced
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.120]   that if you have an audience, then there's lots of ways to make money.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.360]   If you don't have an audience, there's no way to make money, and it all comes down to
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   having an audience.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.300]   Well, how do you know if you can have an audience?
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:12.240]   Well, ordinarily, the appropriate path would be to build an audience, little by little,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:17.300]   and then only make some kind of change when you have an audience.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.240]   But since I wasn't allowed to do a podcast, then I didn't see any pathway forward.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.800]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.520]   So at that time, I decided that I needed another plan.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:37.120]   Now, I had money saved, I wasn't broke, but I had, again, a newborn baby and a wife to
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.420]   take care of, and I was the sole income earner for our household and wasn't going to change
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   that.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.420]   And so I figured, well, what do I do?
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:47.740]   How am I going to get myself out of this mess?
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:55.000]   And I wasn't willing to spend savings down because there was no predictability with it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.620]   I didn't know how long.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.380]   Do you need to do a podcast for five years and then you make a dollar?
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.660]   Do you need to do it for five months and then make a dollar?
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.820]   I had no ability to project.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.280]   So finally, I realized that the way to solve the problem was two things.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.200]   Number one was to leave financial services because if I couldn't do this as a licensed
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.560]   individual, then I would just leave financial services and step two, get a job.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.240]   And I just needed a job, any kind of job doing anything else in the world that would allow
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.020]   me to record a podcast on the side.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.120]   So I looked around.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.680]   I thought about selling cars.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.860]   I went and interviewed with-- I was looking for sales jobs.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.540]   So I went and interviewed with selling cars, thought about a number of different things,
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.720]   tried a handful of different things.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.580]   But ultimately, I was able to get a job working as a back office financial planner.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:52.980]   And once I secured that, then I closed my business, surrendered all of my licenses,
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.300]   canceled all my licenses, and started.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.260]   And so again, what I negotiated was I was working as a back office financial planner
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.100]   for a financial planning firm.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:09.180]   So I would create financial plans for other advisors, and then I would train young advisors
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.920]   on how to present them, how to understand the financial planning, et cetera.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.100]   And that was just enough to make a living.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.280]   Wasn't making anything more than covering my bills, but it allowed me to podcast work
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.780]   from home, et cetera.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:27.660]   And so in 2014, I shut down my business, surrendered all my licenses, and launched.
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:34.700]   And that was episode 11 of Radical Personal Finance in July of 2014.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:39.060]   And so in those early months, I didn't have a plan other than just to podcast as much
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.880]   as I could-- podcast, podcast, podcast.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.580]   And so I was basically doing four to five episodes a week.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:50.500]   And I was trying to figure out, well, as the show started to grow and continued to grow,
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.020]   I was trying to figure out, how do I make a living off of this thing?
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:59.740]   In the early years, my plan was to go ahead and start a new financial planning firm because
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:07.000]   I had figured out that if I registered my own registered investment advisory firm, RIA,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.140]   that I could be my own chief compliance officer.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:15.320]   And if I was my own chief compliance officer and I wanted to go and do a podcast, then
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   I could go and do a podcast.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:24.380]   And to comment on that for a moment, there's no fundamental reason why a financial advisor
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:30.000]   or an insurance agent is legally barred from having a podcast.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.360]   You would know that because many financial advisors for years have had radio shows where
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.060]   they answer questions and they advertise their services.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.060]   And podcasting is fundamentally no different.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:46.140]   A financial advisor may go and have a morning money minute, can go and be interviewed on
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.140]   a talk show.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.340]   And YouTube and podcasts are just other expressions of that.
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:55.320]   The problem comes down to a large firm controlling its liability.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.960]   If you have a large company that has a bunch of lots and lots of agents, then they have
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.340]   to create very large policies to protect their liability.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:12.860]   And an enormous company like Northwestern Mutual, who I was working for, is not going
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.060]   to let every agent just go out and start a podcast.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:22.980]   So they did have a compliance route for doing things like TV appearances at the time.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.420]   And I'm a decade removed from the business, so I don't know much about it anymore.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.580]   But at the time, the process was if you were going to go be on the local TV show, you would
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.020]   write out a script of everything you were going to say.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.480]   You would submit the script to the compliance attorneys in advance.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.580]   They would review the script, give you their approval.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.300]   You would go do the show, and then you would, of course, have to keep a copy of it in the
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.060]   compliance records in case it was ever needed.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.540]   And that was how you could go and do public appearances.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.060]   But I couldn't figure out any way that I could possibly do that with a podcast.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.300]   I wanted to do a lot of content, and there was just no way.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.940]   And they wouldn't let me advertise it, so I just threw up my hands.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.620]   But if I opened my own REA, then I could be my chief compliance officer, and I could do
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.620]   that.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.260]   And basically, the thing you really have to stay away from if you're a licensed financial
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:17.620]   advisor is just being a bozo and making forward-looking, ridiculous statements.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.900]   So you would never say, "Hey, the stock market is going to go up by 50% next year.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.500]   Here's why you should buy this fund."
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.060]   But most normal, educated, ethical financial advisors don't even get anywhere near those
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.060]   kinds of things.
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.540]   So it really doesn't matter.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.700]   So that was the original plan.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:39.520]   I wrote up the paperwork, wrote my form ADV, I filed it with the state, I was waiting for
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.140]   approval when the show really started to go well, and I started to have a significant
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.140]   number of listeners.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.920]   And I looked at the amount of time that I was investing into the podcast, and I realized,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.140]   I don't know that I can do both of these things.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.180]   I don't think I can be a good financial advisor and also a good podcaster.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.020]   I don't think they work well together for the same reason why it's hard to be a good
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.900]   financial planner and a portfolio manager.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.700]   The jobs are just better served by two people.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.980]   It's better to have a financial planner and a portfolio manager working side by side just
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.820]   like it'd be better to have a financial planner and a podcaster working side by side so that
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.340]   you have one person who's doing marketing, who's doing the public-facing stuff, and you
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.660]   have another person who's meeting with clients.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.020]   Because the burden for a financial advisor of serving clients and serving them effectively,
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.540]   it's a significant amount of time, a significant amount of work.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.240]   And I didn't see how I could do both.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:44.040]   So I withdrew my application for the RIA before it was approved and decided I was just going
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.620]   to go all in on podcasting and keep financial planning as a backup option.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:58.520]   I decided that—so one more comment—one of the things that frustrated me for many years was
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:07.660]   the enormous quantity of real conflicts of interest and perceived conflicts of interest
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.460]   in the financial planning business.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:15.860]   I'm someone who cares deeply about ethics, morality, right and wrong.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.580]   Part of it is my nature.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.640]   Part of it is how I was raised.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.340]   Part of it is just, I don't know, I guess by nature.
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.420]   It's an inward—I want to see the weak and the innocent protected.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.820]   I despise bullies.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.340]   I despise predators.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.860]   So it's important to me to deal with those things.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:42.080]   And when you're in financial planning or any aspect of financial services, it's an extreme—it
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.760]   can be—it's certainly an industry that is fraught with risk and potential problems.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:55.720]   And in many cases throughout history, it is and has been an extremely predatory business.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:02.440]   Because of the nature of the business, where you're dealing with large amounts of money,
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:08.080]   where people can get rich quick, it attracts a certain type of person.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.600]   And there's a high correlation between the kind of people who are attracted to financial
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.960]   services and to predators.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.360]   There are also other people who are attracted who want to serve people and want to help
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.780]   people effectively.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.780]   But because there's big money and it's all other people's money and there are enormous
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:30.000]   leverage abilities, financial services attracts a lot of predators.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.280]   And so those predators prey on innocent, helpless, undefenseless—excuse me—defenseless people.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:44.640]   And that creates a very difficult reputation for the industry.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.920]   And at the time, I was very young.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.560]   When I started in financial services, I was 23 years old.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.000]   And so I was very young.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And I didn't have the kind of self-confidence that a more mature man would have.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.320]   And so all the things, even just selling life insurance, for whatever reason, there were—I
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.800]   don't know if there still are, but maybe just my perspective has changed.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:12.080]   But there were all kinds of reputational issues about people being life insurance salesmen.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.040]   Life insurance salesmen were perceived as being aggressive and pushy and all of that,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.820]   especially whole life insurance salesmen.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.920]   And I didn't want to be associated with a lot of that.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:29.980]   Today, I now appreciate life insurance salesmen more than I ever did, but that just has come
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.940]   with maturity.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.280]   So I was frustrated with the conflicts of interest.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:43.140]   And I remember when I finally got out of the industry, and I finally had severed all of
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.360]   my licenses.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:52.400]   And I was sitting at the breakfast table with my family, and I realized I feel free.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.880]   I feel free for the first time in years.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.800]   And I realized how heavy the burden of all of that was on me.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.760]   And it's not only conflicts of interest and perceived conflicts of interest, but when
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.800]   you're a financial advisor, you constantly have to think about making the right decision
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   every single time.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.920]   You have to think about your duties to the client.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.720]   You have to keep careful case notes for when you get sued.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.800]   It's just a nonstop, never-ending burden.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:33.520]   And even those who manage it straightforwardly still wind up with issues.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:41.200]   Because in that business, even the most righteous of intentions don't work out, because people
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.200]   are people.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:49.260]   I remember, as an example of this, I remember one friend of mine who was a young lady.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.040]   I came along, counseled her with finances.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:31:00.460]   I helped her set up an investment plan, helped her open up a Roth IRA, helped her get life
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.000]   insurance.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.560]   And I sold her a small whole life insurance policy.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.240]   And it fit.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   Everything was good.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.840]   My recommendations were prudent.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.340]   Everything was good.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:17.260]   There was nothing that was wrong with my professional recommendations.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.120]   Everything that I had recommended to her was reasonable and appropriate.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.560]   And then three months later, maybe six months, I don't remember.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:32.700]   But some months later, she cancels everything and bails on the whole plan.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.160]   And when you do that, you lose all your money.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.120]   You lose all your money in the life insurance policy.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.880]   You get back money on investments, less commissions and fees that I had gotten paid.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.460]   But the worst was she just canceled everything.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.000]   And of course, I got chargebacks, et cetera.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.920]   And it took me a while to figure it out, because what I realized was I had a very forceful
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   personality.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.900]   I never used aggressive sales tactics.
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.920]   I think to the extent that life insurance agents ever used to use those aggressive sales
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.360]   tactics, that was basically a 1980s thing.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.320]   And it just wasn't a thing when I'm-- and I don't think it's a thing anymore.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.840]   But I was good at painting a vision.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.440]   I was good at showing people where they could be, helping them see a vision of where they
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.740]   could be in 30 years if they started saving money.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.440]   And yet when I would disappear, then they would get distracted and do other things.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.160]   And I just felt terrible.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.680]   And so it was just an example of how you do your very best, then things don't work out.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.800]   And you know then that you've harmed someone.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.920]   And of course, you've been harmed yourself, because all your commissions are reversed.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.520]   You now have a reversal on your history, et cetera.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.860]   It's frustrating.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.400]   But I had harmed someone, even though I had the best of intentions.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.120]   So being free of all that felt amazing.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.980]   And my mission in the early days of the show was I don't ever want to go back into those
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:57.980]   conflicts of interest.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.700]   I want to be perfectly objective.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:04.260]   I want to have perfect objectivity.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.240]   And so this guided my early efforts on the show.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:12.620]   So in the beginning of the show, I said, I'm going to build a podcast that doesn't rely
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.540]   on things that would harm my objectivity.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.380]   I'm not going to take any sponsors.
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.060]   I'm not going to take any ads.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:27.000]   I'm exclusively going to work with people in a purely independent and objective way.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   That was the vision.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.760]   That was the goal.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.320]   So my first plan was to build a listener support model.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:38.040]   At the time, I was a great admirer of Jack Spierko and his The Survival Podcast.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:46.580]   And he had built his revenue model on a listener support model, where he had some extra member
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.760]   resources and things like that for those who supported his show financially.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.680]   And he had some advertisers.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.800]   And so I thought, this is a good model.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.560]   I like how this is going to work.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.300]   So I started building a membership site.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:06.220]   And some of the difficult early stories, I think I was planning on launching the membership
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.700]   site with episode 100 was the plans.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.840]   I built out this membership site.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:15.400]   And it was going to be a voluntary contribution for my audience to support me so I could be
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.660]   independent of conflicts of interest.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:24.300]   And somewhere around, let's call it, episode 95, right before I'm ready to launch my membership
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:29.680]   site, I was getting everything ready and changing with some of the settings with my RSS feed,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.220]   which is the technical behind-the-scenes thing that makes podcasts work.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.380]   And I wound up deleting my RSS feed.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.900]   And so I went overnight.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:45.080]   Right before my big launch, I deleted my entire RSS feed.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.560]   Then I deleted all of my subscribers.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:51.380]   I can laugh now, but it was not fun at the time.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.500]   And it was an innocent mistake.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.600]   I can't remember any of the technical details at the moment.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.180]   I was trying to redirect something.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:03.380]   And I pushed the red button somehow that I didn't know was a dangerous thing.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:08.740]   And so I launched my listener support model with my new membership site.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.220]   And the whole thing fizzled.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   And it took a while.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.620]   It took a couple of months.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.500]   But all my listeners eventually found their way back and more.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.580]   But it was a pretty difficult-- it was a pretty challenging thing.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.140]   Anyway, some people signed up for the listener support model.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.180]   And that was good.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.920]   But then I faced this challenge that every time I would sit down to create-- I was trying
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.700]   to figure out, what is the value proposition?
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:38.220]   What do I offer to my members that they're willing to pay for?
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.220]   And my ambition, because of all this conflict of interest stuff, was my ambition was always
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.420]   to provide a 10x return on anything that someone would pay me.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.640]   So if someone's going to pay me $50, I want them to get $500 worth of value.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.580]   It's always what I've shot for.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.980]   And I tried.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.900]   But every time I would sit down to create extra content, I would just say, oh, this
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   is too good.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.280]   I should just put this out on the show.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   So I would just create more podcasts.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.700]   I would just podcast, podcast, podcast, podcast.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.060]   And I basically didn't have much to offer the listeners.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.040]   And it was sort of kind of working.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.500]   Along the way, I upgraded the website.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.160]   And a friend of mine is a web developer.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.780]   So he started building me a really beautiful website.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.940]   So we just scrapped the whole listener thing.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.780]   And I replaced it with other things.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.440]   I don't need to go through the blow by blow.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:29.500]   But these were continual themes along the way that, over the last 1,000 episodes of
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:34.780]   things that I tried to figure out and struggled with, I would do things like ads.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.580]   I would bring on ads, sponsorships, and then some of them were a good fit.
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.860]   Some of them weren't a good fit.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.780]   I always worried, well, I have to personally vet all the sponsors.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.360]   And I have to do this personal endorsement.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.340]   And that was something that became very difficult to do because how do I check out a company
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   well enough to know that they are excellent, et cetera?
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.460]   And again, I don't need to go through all of the twists and turns.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.640]   But I'm trying to share just a little bit so that you can understand that while the
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.700]   life of a podcaster might seem exotic and, oh, it was just wonderful if you've just got
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.100]   a great podcast and it's all made, no, it's work.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.100]   It's a business just like anything else.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.100]   I enjoy it.
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.840]   I enjoy being able to exercise my ideas for the most part.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:28.500]   But the twists and turns of the business model are difficult.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:34.820]   What I've ultimately done, which has turned out to be a pretty good fit, was, number one,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.220]   I started taking on private clients from the work.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.660]   So at various times, I have done a number of different things.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:48.100]   But the things that have really stuck is, number one, I have a small number of entrepreneurs
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.820]   that I work with on an ongoing coaching basis.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:57.880]   And it usually starts with personal finance, I mean, financial planning, et cetera.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:03.360]   People like my objectivity and the fact that I still don't have any connections with--
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.560]   I've never sold financial products on here.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.840]   I've never made those kinds of connections.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.940]   And so I have ongoing clients that I work with on an ongoing basis.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.380]   And that I really enjoy.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:24.000]   I really enjoy working with entrepreneurs because it brings together all the best of
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.860]   everything from personal finance and just kind of standard CFP-type stuff.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.700]   It brings in, a lot of times, all the international stuff that I really enjoy.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.020]   And it brings in all the business stuff and all the marketing and things like that.
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.020]   That's worked out well.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:42.160]   The second thing that I do related to individuals is I offer paid consultations.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.080]   What has worked well is I offer these throughout the year at different times.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.700]   But these are just straightforward phone consultations.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:58.640]   And what I like about them is that I'm able to focus on the 80% return, which is the ideas
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.600]   or the direction.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:06.560]   I've developed a pretty unique skill of usually being able to cut to the heart of an idea
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.840]   due to broad knowledge and exposure and due to just broad interest.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.300]   I can usually focus on the heart of the idea.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.520]   What I cut out of the equation is all of the implementation stuff.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.420]   So I don't implement financial plans the way that a financial planner would do.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.920]   I don't go through and make sure everything gets signed and et cetera.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.680]   And so it's kind of up to a client.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.680]   Client shows up.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.680]   They pay me.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.600]   And at the end of the phone call, I'm done.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.780]   I move on.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:38.080]   And then if there's implementation or follow-through, then that has to be accomplished by the client.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.600]   And it's an imperfect model because a huge component of the usefulness of a financial
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.120]   planner is being able to prod people forward and get them to take action when they otherwise
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.160]   wouldn't.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.600]   As with most of us, how much better would we be if we had coaches in all the important
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.280]   areas of our lives nagging us and prodding us and reminding us for all the things that
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.080]   are necessary so that we continue to press forward?
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.640]   That's really great, but it's not something that I'm interested in doing.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.400]   And so offering those kinds of consultations has been good.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:17.640]   I also have found that I really enjoy teaching courses and I create all my courses from scratch.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:27.040]   And basically what I've discovered is my personal superpower is I am world class at taking a
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.360]   subject that I'm interested in, absorbing either all of the material or huge quantities
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:40.420]   of the material that is available on the subject, and then organizing and synthesizing those
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:44.120]   ideas to where they're practical.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.160]   And that's what I'm really good at.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.060]   And so then the natural expression of that is to take that and reorganize the material
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:59.320]   from a question or a topic or whatever that we're dealing with, reorganize the material
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.040]   in a way that makes sense so that you understand what's important now and what's important
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.560]   later and you can move through a process of change in a really effective and efficient
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.880]   way.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:22.000]   And for me, creating those courses is, again, a real joy because I'm able to, I think, answer
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.960]   questions that people have about seeming paradoxes in various industries.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.680]   And I'm able to do that by using things like a lens of scale or understanding what matters
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.680]   now.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.520]   And this is why so much, and helping people understand where is advice actually in conflict
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.600]   and where are you just perceiving advice to be in conflict.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.160]   And most financial issues especially really are fairly straightforward.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:58.040]   And if somebody understands both sides of an argument or eight sides of an argument,
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:05.680]   you can see how it's the individual conditions of the person that ultimately determine which
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.400]   of these eight arguments is the correct argument.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.300]   And to me, that stuff just falls in place pretty easily and logically, et cetera.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:18.080]   So I've tried to do that with my courses, and I'm pretty satisfied with most of them.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.920]   Put some of them on the market, pulled some of them off, gone back and forth.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.760]   But I'm satisfied with the quality of the content.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.880]   I've never been really satisfied with the quality of the production.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:38.080]   One of the things that's happened in the world of ideas is simply we have created more beautiful
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:45.140]   production around ideas, and that has made it harder for idea people to match that level
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.200]   of production.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   There's a real balance here because-- let me just articulate this to teach the concept.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:06.400]   Books are a profoundly valuable way to share ideas.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.900]   And throughout history, one of the key features of a book is simply that a book requires one
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.220]   person to create it.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:21.240]   One man can sit down with a notebook, a legal pad, and a pen and write a book.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.440]   And that book, if he has skill as a writer, that book can be powerful and persuasive.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.700]   And that's all of the great books that we read.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:34.740]   That's how they've been created with one guy sitting at his desk writing it out, one lady
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:39.700]   with a vision for what she wanted to create sitting down and writing out the book.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.480]   Most other forms of media require a much larger team.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.140]   This is the difference between a book and a movie.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:51.500]   A movie, to bring a movie to fruition, requires an enormous team of skilled specialists to
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.180]   create something.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:57.580]   And in some cases, it's better and more satisfying than the written version.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.780]   In many cases, it's not.
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.040]   But it requires a lot more specialists.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:10.500]   In the past, the way to get rich on ideas was to write them down and then sell people
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.080]   the ideas for a cost.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.740]   And that has been a very effective business model.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:21.300]   I've spent a lot of money over the years on extremely valuable information products.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.380]   I still reference many of those information products.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.820]   Today, the expectations have changed, and digital courses, because of their ease of
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.640]   administration and delivery, have become much more attractive.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:44.320]   But creating successful digital courses starts to create the problem of transfer, of needing
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.480]   a big team, the same way that you have the problem of needing a big team to create a
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.240]   movie as compared to writing a novel.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.680]   And so I've always been frustrated with my ability to create the high production value
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.880]   that I've wanted.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.580]   And so that's one of the reasons I took a lot of my courses down.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.700]   Not complaining, not saying I should have, just sharing honestly a little bit about the
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   journey.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:16.100]   Fast forward, those are the basic-- and then advertising, of course, I have ads on Radical
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.580]   Personal Finance now.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.660]   It has been frustrating to me to figure out a solution for that.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:26.580]   I had planned to create a solution where there were ads, and then there was a premium version
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.080]   where you could just pay to have the ads off.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.420]   That hasn't worked, but the ads matter.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.120]   They pay me enough to keep me wanting to go and wanting to create podcasts.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.800]   And so those are the basic things that I have done.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.020]   Now in the future, there's a lot more room for more things, but I'm not getting into
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   the future today.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:49.460]   Just sharing that these are some of the twists and turns of entrepreneurship.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.320]   Thanks to you, the show has grown.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.620]   The show has provided a lot of opportunity for me.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.280]   Radical Personal Finance, I haven't looked up recent numbers, but it's in the top few
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.580]   percent of all podcasts.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:05.260]   Right now, with episode 1,000, my total downloads-- and these numbers change based upon whether
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.700]   you want to use impressive numbers or less impressive numbers, and there's a bunch of
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.380]   metrics for measuring this-- but something like 30 million downloads, just under 30 million
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:18.100]   downloads for episode 1,000, which is great.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.940]   And it's been quite the journey.
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.420]   I've enjoyed it.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.620]   Speaking personally, my longtime listeners have gone with us on quite a journey.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:32.800]   I never really expected all of the twists and turns over the last 10 years, but I'm
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.660]   grateful for them.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:39.100]   When I began the show originally-- again, my wife was pregnant with our first baby,
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.340]   and then the second launch in 2014, we had our first baby.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:49.480]   Well, fast forward 10 years later, here we are in 2024, and we've had five babies.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.260]   We've traveled quite a lot.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.700]   We've lived in multiple places.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.620]   We've traveled a good amount.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.820]   We've traveled all around the United States, lived in an RV with our three children.
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.820]   We've lived abroad.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.340]   We've traveled around the world.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:07.860]   I don't know how many countries, but quite a lot.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.300]   And a lot of that stuff has just been me testing things.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   I enjoy learning ideas, testing them, and sharing with you some of the lessons that
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.780]   I have learned.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.420]   And radical personal finance, in many ways, has been a perfect outlet for me in that way.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:27.580]   I can take an idea that I'm really interested in, I can talk about that idea, I can learn
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:36.420]   about that idea, I can share with you the ideas and concepts, and then see those ideas
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.940]   implemented in other people's lives.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.420]   And that's been really exciting.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.060]   Some of the things I never anticipated.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.260]   So I never anticipated leaving the United States.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.460]   That was not 10 years ago.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.940]   It wouldn't have surprised me, I guess, if you had said, this is where you'll be.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.500]   Just because, OK, I'm open to that.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   But it was never a plan.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.460]   It was just one of those things that's a reaction to various events, and saw an opportunity,
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.900]   and went for it, and then learned a little bit more, and then realized, hey, you know
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.900]   what?
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.380]   I kind of like this stuff.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.500]   And that was part of the dream.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:11.500]   Also, though, the dream has changed, and even just the business plan has changed over the
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   years.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:19.300]   When I was 15 years old, that was the point in which we were first starting to use the
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.940]   internet to sell ideas to one another, and sell packages.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:30.340]   And I remember I bought some online business course at 15, and I developed the goal of
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.220]   a laptop lifestyle.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.560]   And I wanted to be able to make money from my laptop.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.780]   That way I could live anywhere in the world, do what I want, and live how I want.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:43.100]   And it took me 15 years to accomplish it, but eventually I did.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:48.740]   And in the beginning, my goals were rather modest.
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:52.600]   When I started Radical Personal Finance, I wasn't trying to make a million dollars.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.660]   I wanted to make 100 grand from a laptop, because I figured with geo arbitrage, and
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.100]   with time arbitrage, and et cetera, if I can make 100 grand from a laptop anywhere in the
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.580]   world, man, I'm doing well.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.320]   And so that was good.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.180]   It took me, I don't know, two, three years to do that.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.460]   And I was content.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.000]   That was what I was going for.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:21.720]   And then I realized though that because that model of just kind of a rather modest business,
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.280]   I realized that I was never going to be able to have the kind of impact that I was capable
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   of having.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:35.300]   I remember distinctly in the beginning of 2017, I was reading my Bible, and I was reading
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.140]   the book of Matthew.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:43.880]   And there's a passage in the book of Matthew that really struck me in a way that I had
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.240]   never thought about.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:50.400]   But it basically says, "Your light of the world, a city set on a hill, cannot be hidden,
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.660]   nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the stand, and it gives light
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.260]   to all in the house.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:03.320]   In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:06.640]   and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.720]   And I'm sitting here looking at my Bible, and I have a note in it, but it just seemed
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.740]   like in 2017, it just felt like with that verse that God spoke to me and said, "Stop
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.740]   playing small."
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:24.520]   And I realized that I had this very small vision, and I needed to change that.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.960]   Because if I was going to be faithful, then it's not enough just to see to what I need
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.820]   or what I want or have enough money to pay my bills, but I needed to be much more diligent
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:34.820]   than that.
[00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.480]   And that started a process of trying to figure out, "How do I stop playing small?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.480]   How do I think bigger?"
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:44.120]   And I think this is an appropriate time for me to pivot to, over the years, many things
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:51.160]   have changed in my own philosophy relating to money, and long-term listeners have heard
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.020]   those changes.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:58.480]   Probably one of the biggest ones, if I went back to 10 years, was that when I started
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:05.560]   the podcast, I very much saw myself as part of the FIRE movement.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.200]   I was extremely interested in financial independence, early retirement.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.740]   That was a real vision of mine.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:20.140]   I read all of-- the big influence that I first found was Early Retirement Extreme by Jacob
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:24.360]   Lund Fisker, and then this was the time that Mr. Money Mustache became popular, and I read
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.160]   all of his stuff, and I just loved it.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   And I started integrating those concepts with my clients even when I was a financial advisor,
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:36.720]   and I was really committed to hyperfrugality and working hard for early retirement as much
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.960]   as I possibly could.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   And when I started Radical Personal Finance, I was still interested in that.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:50.160]   I had made the decision that-- because if I had stayed in traditional financial planning,
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   I would have made a lot more money faster, and as I saw it, that was a faster path to
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.200]   financial independence.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.640]   But I realized if you have a business that provides you with a lifestyle of financial
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.840]   independence, it allows you to live the way you want to live, then you don't have to wait
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.240]   10 years or 20 years, whatever it takes you to accumulate the money to retire.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.880]   You can just do that now.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.020]   And I realized, OK, I'll just do that.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.040]   And I felt a little bit hypocritical because I was going to be talking about money, but
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.740]   I figured as long as I'm honest about it, then that'll be fine.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.240]   I'll just tell people honestly, but this is why I'm doing it.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.000]   After all, there's nothing morally wrong with it.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.720]   Just build a lifestyle business instead of trying to build an enormous fortune.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:33.640]   And so I was really, really interested in early retirement.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.100]   It was important to me.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:40.520]   But over time, I had a variety of realizations.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:50.840]   The first one was simply that a significant problem for me in those years was not that
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:56.340]   I needed to retire from work, but just that I was in a job for which I was poorly suited.
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.200]   And that was the basic thing.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:02.860]   And I realized what I teach now, it's easier to find a different job than it is to build
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.520]   a fortune and retire.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.760]   And that probably should be the first thing that you do.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.120]   And that was why my first course that I did was the Radical Personal Finance Career and
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.680]   Income Guide.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:19.620]   Because if you can generate your income in a way that is pleasing to you, that provides
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:26.600]   you with the kind of lifestyle that you want to live, you don't need to build a fortune
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   so you can quit work at 30 years old.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.260]   And it's better, it's easier for you to spend a couple of years trying different jobs, trying
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.360]   different businesses, going from this to that until hopefully after a few years, you can
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.560]   find something that really fits you.
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:45.320]   That's a lot easier than building a fortune so that you can retire early.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.800]   And that was a big realization that I had.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.140]   A second big realization was something that occurred more slowly.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.900]   And it's probably just a natural phase change of life.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:00.540]   But I became a lot less selfish in my thinking.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:08.120]   And I started to care more about the world in general, the kingdom of God more specifically,
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.180]   my own children more specifically.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:17.980]   And I started to realize that it was kind of dumb to spend all my life thinking about
[00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.020]   pleasure.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:25.400]   And I realized that that was a unifying theme through much of the content that I was absorbing
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.320]   at the time, that I was spending all my time listening to people who would go on and on
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:34.500]   and on and on about pleasure and happiness and personal pleasure, et cetera, this never
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:35.760]   ending list.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.120]   There were differences.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:40.200]   Jacob Lundfisker, for example, is not necessarily that way.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.680]   He's much more of a guy who wants to be creative.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.380]   But Mr. Money Mustache and Tim Ferriss and all these other people that I was really looking
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:54.020]   up to and absorbing all their content and really trying to do everything, as I grew
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:55:02.080]   older, I've just come to think of their ideology as very immature and very shortsighted.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.360]   And to be clear, I don't want you to think I'm saying more than I am.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   They've matured.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.600]   They've changed as well.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.960]   All of us go through a process of maturing in life.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.000]   And so I don't fault them.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.960]   But what I realized is I don't want to be one of these guys who sits around and smokes
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.860]   weed and goes on and on about how all I just do is what I want to do, and I don't make
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.860]   a difference in the world.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.280]   Like, I want to make a difference in the world.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.520]   And I expect it to be a rather modest difference, but I still want to make a difference where
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.760]   I can.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:35.520]   And as I sorted through my own theology and realized that work is not a curse, work is
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.240]   a blessing, then it's not something that I want to be without.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:45.080]   And I want to work.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.320]   And I just want to work in things that are meaningful and things for which I'm well-suited.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:56.280]   So that was an enormous change for me as I stopped being interested in the fire stuff
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:03.240]   because it just seems like in many ways, not all, it doesn't have to be, but it seems like
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:07.860]   something that attracts people to a rather shallow vision.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:16.180]   And I probably came to that conviction somewhere around, I don't know, 2017, probably 2018.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.280]   But I've watched other people come through that journey as well.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.320]   And that's really fascinating for me.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.320]   I'm glad we come through the journey.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.480]   And again, I'm not upset at anybody.
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.800]   We all go through our own journeys of learning.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.280]   And although we wish we could be smarter and find things without learning them the hard
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.240]   way, a lot of times, of course, we wind up learning things the hard way.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:40.320]   My point is simply that what resonated with me then doesn't resonate with me now.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:45.800]   What resonates with me now is desire for impact and change.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:51.360]   And this leads me to the next topic, which is that a lot of my ideas have changed as
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   well.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   There's some foundational stuff.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.760]   For example, I'm no longer as radical as I once was.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.080]   I think the radical personal finance brand is good branding.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.800]   It really works well.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800]   It's intriguing.
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.600]   I'm happy with the brand.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.160]   But I'm not as radical as I once was.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:15.600]   And the best expression of this is that as I've grown older, I've realized how many of
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:26.560]   my radical ideas were not supported by a clear examination of the systems that be.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:31.440]   Rather, it was me looking at something and saying, "Well, here's everything that's wrong
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.400]   with it, and here I'm going to fix it."
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:41.040]   I've come to love the example of Chesterton's fence post, a well-known writer named G.K.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   Chesterton.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.040]   He wrote something.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   I'll read the original quote.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.560]   But here's the original quote.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:52.320]   He says, "There exists in such a case a certain institution or law, let us say, for the sake
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:56.840]   of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.560]   The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.560]   this.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.560]   Let us clear it away.'
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer, 'If you don't see
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:12.040]   the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.520]   Go away and think.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.400]   Then, when you can come back and tell me what you do see the use of it, tell me that you
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.200]   do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'"
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:25.080]   And again, that's G.K.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   Chesterton.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:31.240]   And what I have realized over the last decade is that when I began radical personal finance,
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.280]   I was reformer number one.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:37.240]   I was a modern reformer who goes gaily up to the fence and says, "I don't see the use
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   of this fence.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   Let's clear it away.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.720]   I don't see the use of working in offices.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:43.640]   I don't see the use of working on a certain time.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.820]   I don't see the use of working until you're 65.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:49.820]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.720]   I don't see the use of this, that, and the other thing."
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:59:02.300]   Just kind of this very young, immature, find-nothing-but-fault-with-the-system-and-wanna-be-a-fire, a brand-waving revolutionary.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:10.660]   Today, I probably still have that tendency, but today, I'm much more in camp number two,
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:16.280]   which I want to understand the structures of society.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.400]   I want to understand the structures of life, of finances, et cetera.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:29.320]   I want to understand them very, very well before I call to abolish them.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:36.200]   It's not to say that the opinion and the direction may not still be true, or the overall thing
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.920]   could be true, but I want to be very cautious about that.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.960]   I want to be wise and affirmation.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.020]   For example, I still hold lots of unusual opinions.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:50.780]   I'd love to see the welfare state disbanded, but if I were, today, anointed emperor of
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.500]   the world, I would not disband the welfare state today.
[00:59:54.500 --> 01:00:02.680]   I would try to put in place some kind of slow plan that would actually come to fruition
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.300]   to make that happen, but it needs to happen slowly.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.720]   I'm a bit of a firebrand when it comes to the topic of education.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.840]   I think most people should pull their children out of government schools, but if I were anointed
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.080]   emperor of the universe today, I wouldn't just whole-handed, right away, shutter the
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.520]   government schools and financial examples as well.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.880]   I wouldn't just end everything today.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.880]   I wouldn't end the US dollar.
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.400]   I try to be thoughtful about these things because we need to grow into new changes.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.340]   I reflected this years ago with a show that I think it is a show on basically the difference
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.700]   between revolution and reformation.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:47.040]   When I was younger, I saw myself as I aligned or identified with the revolutionaries.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.220]   Today I don't identify with the revolutionaries.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.040]   I see the revolutionaries as dangerous.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.140]   Today I identify with the reformers, and I don't want to be a revolutionary.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.060]   I want to be a reformer.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.380]   You can never predict the direction a revolution will go, but you can predict the direction
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.740]   that reformation can go.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.340]   I can clearly see that this is something that's due to age, due to experience.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:14.420]   I can clearly see the frustration that young people have with older people who want to
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.200]   slow things down.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:24.160]   I hope that my generation, or at least I, can effectively harness the zeal and enthusiasm
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.480]   that young people have and then point it in a healthy direction and inform it by wisdom.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.120]   I don't think that zeal has to always be ignorant.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.540]   In fact, it shouldn't be.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.900]   I was never one myself who…
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:37.900]   I had a lot of zeal.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:42.020]   I still have a lot of zeal, but I've always tried to listen to people.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.540]   If people could explain to me a better way, I'll happily get rid of one set of ideas
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.820]   and adopt another.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:56.420]   I see myself as independent from my ideas in the sense that I can pull any set of ideas
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.900]   out of my mind, put it on the table, look at it from all the different directions, assess
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.900]   it, see if it's valid.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.560]   If it's valid, I'll pick it up, stick it back in my mind.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.300]   If it's not valid, toss it in the garbage can and pick up a new set.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:12.440]   And while certainly ideas are connected, I'm not threatened by thinking about ideas and
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.440]   talking about them.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:20.720]   And so I hope that we can do a good job of continuing to nurture youthful zeal and enthusiasm,
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.800]   but it should always be informed by the wisdom of the elders.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.120]   And I see that more clearly today than I did a decade ago.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.700]   I'm generally satisfied though with testing ideas.
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.720]   I can share with you some of the ideas that I've tested at Radical Personal Finance.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.660]   Tested the concept of entrepreneurship specifically.
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.880]   And what I'll tell you about entrepreneurship is it is a solution to many of the things
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.260]   that frustrate people about work and business.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:59.060]   I prize very highly the general sense of independence that I have, the fact that I can say what
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.500]   I want and do what I want.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.020]   That is very meaningful to me.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:13.140]   When I was just starting the podcast, there was a very popular financial brand who had
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:20.600]   a very established brand, and this guy entreated me to come and work with him.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.980]   He could see that we could make a good partnership, et cetera.
[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.600]   And I seriously considered it because I admired the brand.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.380]   I was a big, big fan.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:35.360]   I considered the advice very strong and excellent, et cetera, just all good.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.740]   I was happy with it.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:43.520]   I ultimately said no, and I said no to retain my independence of speech and my independence
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]   of action.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:51.320]   I knew that there was a good chance that in the coming years, I wanted freedom after having
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:56.860]   so many restrictions on my speech for so many years in the formal business, I didn't want
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.280]   to establish some kind of sense of duty or obligation to a business partner, that I had
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:12.660]   to tone down something that I genuinely believe in order to not harm his brand or do something
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:13.960]   that I thought was right.
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.120]   And so I stepped aside from-- so I didn't take that partnership.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.840]   And I think I would have made lots more money if I had, but I haven't really regretted it
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.020]   because I've been grateful to have the freedom that I've had.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.280]   And so entrepreneurship can provide a lot of those things.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.540]   When I look at why people want to be fi, why they want to be financially independent, it
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:40.660]   a lot of times just comes down to these silly things of I have to be here at a certain time
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.700]   and a certain day, and I don't have any control over my schedule.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.700]   And so I appreciate entrepreneurship as one potential solution to those things.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.020]   However, entrepreneurship brings with it a whole different set of advantages.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:57.720]   I think I'm a pretty good match for entrepreneurship, but there's a lot of things about it that I
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.700]   find really frustrating.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:05.480]   And there are many times that I have wished just for a job where I just went to work.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.620]   And I think that's common.
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.200]   So if you're in a job, don't think that entrepreneurship is going to solve everything.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.040]   And likewise, don't think that if you're an entrepreneur, everything's going to be solved
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.400]   if you just go and get a job.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.120]   I now think that I could go back and forth between these things fairly happily.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.060]   Things like working in an office, when I was younger, one of my goals was not to have to
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.060]   work in an office.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.260]   I didn't like going to an office every day.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:29.820]   Today I now appreciate an office.
[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.140]   I work in an office.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.940]   I just work in an office alone.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:35.900]   But that's one of the things I don't like about entrepreneurship.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.900]   I get lonely.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:44.700]   And not on an emotional level, but in a sense of feeling like I'm working alone, not on
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.140]   a daily basis, don't sound so pathetic, I get lonely.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.400]   What I mean is, on a daily life, I'm around a lot of people.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.340]   But I miss the sense of camaraderie and purpose that comes from working with others.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:03.880]   So there's really something really strong and valuable about being in an office, feeling
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:09.360]   like you're a part of a team, working towards the team's outcomes and not just my own outcomes.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.880]   That's something that is really wonderful that I miss.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.180]   And I haven't found yet the offer or something that would take me, but I've thought about
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   it.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.820]   And I have ideas about the kinds of things that I would take, where I would take a job
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:31.100]   again or I would take a job or an opportunity because of that desire to have a sense of
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:36.060]   camaraderie with other people and wanting to work with other people towards a common
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.520]   vision, towards a common goal.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.820]   Those things make a difference.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.820]   I've tested other things.
[01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.360]   I've tested many retirements along the way.
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.900]   I've tested travel.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:54.140]   And what I've discovered is simply that there's a reason we live in houses, just as a very
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.140]   practical example.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.060]   When I was younger, I thought I was pretty obsessed with the idea of just living in an
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.060]   RV.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:07.100]   I was a Tynan fan years before most people were, and I just thought, "Oh, this is how
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.940]   I want to live."
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.900]   And I still am attracted to that.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:16.620]   But there's a big difference between being attracted to it as a single man or as a married
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.300]   couple versus doing it with children.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.200]   With children, there's a reason why we have the ideas that we have about people going
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:28.160]   to the suburbs, that in order for a family to build towards something productive, stable
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.380]   infrastructure is very useful.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:35.020]   Now, it's not that traveling is bad.
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:36.620]   We've done full-time RV travel.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:41.340]   I have a plan to do more of it in the future because I think it provides a cool set of
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:46.840]   adventures and experiences that really are hard to get in any other way.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.460]   But it doesn't magically solve anything.
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:54.860]   It doesn't magically fix your life just because you have these external things.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.260]   One thing I've given up on is finding some kind of thing that's just going to magically
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.300]   fix anything.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.780]   Changing your location doesn't just fix anything.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.700]   Changing the time of day that you work doesn't fix anything.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.700]   You're still there.
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:07.700]   You still got to do the work.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.580]   So, disciplining yourself to sit down and do the work whether you feel like it or not
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:16.740]   is still kind of a fundamental secret of success.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:21.500]   I've changed some perspectives on various financial planning things.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.660]   Some of those are pretty significant and a lot of them have to do with the sense of being
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.140]   radical.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.300]   For example, one that is probably the first one that comes to mind is I used to be against
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.180]   home ownership.
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:41.860]   In the early days of radical personal finance, I was influenced by Jim Collins' essay on
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.660]   how you're better off renting because you're flexible and you can move here and move there
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.940]   and after all, your money is more productive in the stock market.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:55.840]   I think that's interesting and a useful perspective and I think, again, there's a proper application
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   for that.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:04.440]   A 21-year-old guy or girl who's working on building a career, I would say home ownership
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.160]   might turn out to be less of a blessing than flexibility.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   Stay flexible.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:15.500]   On the other hand, I've come to appreciate and also, I felt that a home should be viewed
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:23.440]   as an expense rather than as an asset, kind of channeling the Robert Kiyosaki, Rich Dad,
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.520]   Poor Dad ideology.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.240]   That was my perspective back then.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.500]   Today I don't see it that way.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:35.280]   Today I'm persuaded that investing into a primary home that you live in is a perfectly
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.020]   legitimate form of real estate investing.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.500]   Not only is it legitimate but it's often quite profitable.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:45.180]   John Reed wrote his book, An American Principal Resident is the Most Advantaged Investment
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.180]   in History.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.180]   Worst title ever.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:51.380]   I don't know why he did that but it's a very good book and it persuaded me of the value
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:58.020]   of simply investing into your home and that's become something that I've frequently done.
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:04.140]   Whereas in the past, I would say to a wealthy business owner, a wealthy doctor or something,
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.620]   I would say, "Oh, yeah, you should go ahead and have real estate today."
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.820]   I just say, "Listen, if you want to do real estate, that's fine but just go ahead and
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:15.300]   buy a more expensive home and upgrade your home systematically throughout your life and
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:18.620]   that's a perfectly valid form of real estate investing."
[01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.420]   So I think that's a good example of something changing.
[01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:30.260]   On the whole, there's not a lot in my views on money or investing or financial planning
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.420]   that have changed a lot.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:38.940]   The biggest one that I was pretty blind to in the beginning was internationalization.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.620]   Like most financial planners, I didn't know anything about international planning.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:47.140]   When I started doing this, you can be a CFP, certified financial planner and not have a
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.540]   clue about anything that I talk about now international.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.380]   I remember when I first—I was doing this show when I first learned about the foreign
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   earned income exclusion.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:56.580]   I was like, "What?"
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:02.020]   And as I've shared, that came in response to me of a moral crisis of basically how on
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.300]   earth can I pay taxes and have a clear conscience?
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.700]   And I realized, "Oh, I'm not stuck.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.100]   I can choose who I pay taxes to.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.660]   I can actually choose whether or not I pay taxes."
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.060]   And that was one of the things that launched the whole international space.
[01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.020]   So that would be a big thing as I now see international planning as something that really
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.260]   everyone should do to some degree as I teach in my International Skate Planning course,
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:30.020]   but not something that is—it's something everyone should do to some degree, but it's—and
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.600]   it should be more mainstream.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.780]   And it is becoming mainstream, which I'm glad about.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.420]   So that would be a big change.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.300]   I have a list of other things, but I won't go deeply into them at the moment.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.980]   But I've tried to track the things that have changed and the things that haven't changed.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:50.940]   On the whole, probably the biggest one was my own opinion of early retirement and of
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.420]   retirement in general.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.640]   I thought, "Oh, okay, you can just navigate through it."
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.580]   In terms of early retirement, it was in the beginning of the show where I did shows on
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.360]   kind of the retirement scam.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:09.520]   But then I realized and I still realize that work is such a profoundly valuable part of
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:17.040]   our life, and it's how we contribute to the world around us.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.660]   All the great change that we all want to see in the world is going to come from work.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:26.020]   That work doesn't have to be paid, doesn't have to come with money, but it does need
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:33.880]   to come, it does need to happen, and it is a valuable component of our overall life.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.340]   I thought it would be fun now to share with you some thoughts about individual episodes
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:42.600]   of Radical Personal Finance, share with you some of the more popular episodes, share with
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.320]   you a few of my favorites, share with you the most controversial episodes, et cetera.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.180]   Let's begin with the most popular.
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:53.640]   As of this current recording, the most popular episode of Radical Personal Finance ever was
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.620]   episode 666, How to Prepare for the Coming Recession, followed by episode 716, called
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.680]   How to Profit from a Recession.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:13.580]   It's interesting, we certainly see that the most bad news, clickbait works, first of all.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:18.820]   So if I try to not use too much clickbait, but clickbait works, and I say how to prepare
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:24.280]   for the coming recession, then there's an element of people who want to just hear, wait
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.800]   a second, how do I prepare for it?
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.160]   And also, is there a recession coming?
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.000]   So that's clearly a component of it.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.640]   And then also, our eyes are attracted to bad news far more than good news.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.000]   We hear a lot about when the stock market is falling apart.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.920]   We don't hear so much when the stock market is doing well.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.940]   And so let's just be aware of that with regard to overall psychological understanding.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.280]   I'm proud of those episodes.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.600]   I think they're useful.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:58.640]   I've tried to always strike a tone of sensibleness, and yet seriousness.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.960]   I've tried to treat topics with seriousness, and yet be sensible.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.320]   So those would be the two most popular.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.480]   If you're curious, the next one is how to read a book, and then how to set financial
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480]   goals.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:19.520]   There was really probably a golden time in those download numbers where some of the most
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:26.400]   popular ones are from episodes in the high 600s and early 700s.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.560]   Most of the most popular episodes come from that time.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:33.160]   And that was before the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   So that was 2019, 2020, and that was when the podcast was getting the highest number
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.160]   of podcast downloads.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:46.280]   Then when coronavirus came on, it seemed to change the podcast listening experience.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.640]   And downloads have been down across the industry since then.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.680]   And then there's been some technical changes that have happened behind the scenes that
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.280]   have also created changes in the download numbers.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:06.120]   So those are most of the highest shows for me come from the high 600s and the lower 700s.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.120]   There are, I'll skip kind of the least popular shows because that's not something that's
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:19.720]   interesting necessarily, but it's been interesting to me to watch how I'm basically incapable
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.080]   of predicting what is the most popular.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:29.840]   And that's been frustrating because I'd like to plan and create popular content.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.440]   I've done that a little bit.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.760]   One of the things I said I was going to do in the early days of the show was that I was
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.680]   going to teach my way through the CFP curriculum.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:42.720]   That was something that I originally said I would do, but I kind of, I didn't intentionally
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.380]   abandon it, but I just practically abandoned it after several dozen episodes because I
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:53.400]   just found that people didn't listen to those and yet they required enormous amounts of
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.960]   time to create.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.520]   And the things that people listened to were often things that I just sat down and had
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:05.000]   an idea and boom, went for and then people listened to them.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.360]   So that was something that I learned from that perspective.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.960]   Some of my favorite episodes, I've really enjoyed a lot of the series that I have done.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.280]   One of my favorites was the asset protection for mere mortals series.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:26.300]   I enjoyed that because it dealt with a technical area of financial planning that is wildly
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.260]   under discussed in serious ways.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:35.320]   And I was satisfied with, I love the sense of empowerment that I got, that I could empower
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:42.420]   ordinary people to protect their assets so that they, in a time that they might most
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.420]   need it.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.500]   One of my favorite series was also kind of foundational philosophy series, my seven rings
[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:58.560]   of Liberty series, I really loved doing that one because I feel like in that series I encapsulated
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.300]   the ideas that lead to a free lifestyle.
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:10.000]   And while they're not easy to implement, I think that they are the most effective way
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.900]   of accomplishing some of the things that people are looking for Liberty with.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.960]   I have this continual challenge that I try to answer people's questions and what people
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.080]   are looking for, but I don't see a lot of the financial solutions as the fast and straightforward
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   way to achieve the kind of lifestyle you want.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.580]   And so when I started that podcast series and I talked about ring number one, which
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:39.400]   is spiritual Liberty, to me, that drives at the heart of what people are trying to do.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.360]   They're trying to solve things with money where their spirit is broken.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.240]   But if you can find spiritual Liberty, you can be free no matter what the money looks
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.280]   like.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:54.120]   And I think that's something that's dramatically under-discussed, and we talked about all the
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:18:01.720]   different lifestyle design things that for me have really paid off.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.280]   So that was one of my favorite series, and I think the third one that I really loved
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.340]   doing recently was the Investing in Your Children series.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:16.800]   That series was longer than I intended, but once again, it was me indulging that frustration
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.820]   of years of people saying, "What about my 529 plan?"
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:26.220]   And my answer is, "Your 529 plan is great, but it's not going to do what you're hoping
[01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:31.360]   it does for you because it's only one thing, and what you need is this more comprehensive
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.940]   plan, this more comprehensive approach.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:38.120]   And if you'll do these other things, then the 529 plan is completely unnecessary."
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.460]   And it's often hard for me to judge with things like that, those kinds of ideas.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:48.020]   It's hard for me to judge how much people can implement them.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.500]   I'm something of an extremist by nature.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.900]   When someone says, "This is really hard," I say, "Ooh, let me pay attention."
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:19:00.220]   And I'm aware, though, that hard things are hard to do, but you do hard things and you
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.940]   get great results.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:11.560]   But I don't know, I just record stuff and let things go where they may be.
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.920]   Most controversial episodes of radical personal finance, well, there's one touching on hot
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.160]   button topics.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:26.360]   Probably to date still, probably the most controversial one was, I think 181, 181.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.480]   I talked about why we need more of a discussion of politics, religion, and I don't know, something
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:37.600]   else in financial discussions.
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.180]   And obviously, a bit of an inflammatory title here.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.720]   Why we need more discussion of politics, religion, philosophy, morality, and ethics in finance,
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.780]   not less.
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.220]   That was the title of it.
[01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.140]   And what I shared in that episode was, I had just read, I had an enormous epiphany.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.120]   This was 2015 when I did that podcast episode.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:03.160]   And this was right at the time of the passing of the Obergefell decision in the United States,
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.040]   legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:15.520]   And as I was following those events, I read a book called After the Ball by Hunter Madsen
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.160]   and Kirk something or other, sorry, I can't remember the other author's name.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.460]   But they had written a book called After the Ball, How America Will Lose Its Fear of Gays
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.920]   in the '90s.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:32.440]   And when I read the book, I was absolutely blown away that for the first time in my life,
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:41.300]   I understood and could believe how societal influence and propaganda works.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:48.460]   I had been aware of the concept of societal change prior to that.
[01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.460]   How could you not?
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.760]   I had been aware of conspiracy theories, et cetera.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.760]   How could you not be at least aware of some of these things?
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:00.100]   But I've never been a big believer in most of those things.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:07.060]   And a lot of it is just that I don't understand how most conspiracies could come to fruition.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:13.520]   So for example, there are two ideas that I think some people hold.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.200]   Idea number one is that government is incompetent.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.400]   And idea number two is that government is engaged in a vast conspiracy.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.920]   And I don't see how either those ideas can go together.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:32.080]   Either you believe that governments are incompetent and thus most big conspiracies, at least on
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.800]   a governmental level, can't happen.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:41.280]   Or you believe that government is highly competent and thus elaborate, carefully held, multigenerational
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.480]   conspiracies can come true.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:49.520]   Now, that may be a simplistic expression of the idea, but it's always bothered me.
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.440]   But when I finally read the book After the Ball and I realized I could look back on my
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:22:02.960]   entire lifetime growing up in the '90s and the '90s and the 2000s, leading up to 2015,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:10.000]   that not only was there the single largest measured change in opinion in recorded history
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.120]   where the entire country in about 15 years went from strongly opposing the concept of
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.900]   same-sex marriage to strongly supporting it.
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:27.640]   And I could see all the politicians of my lifetime—President Obama was for same-sex
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.720]   marriage, then he was against same-sex marriage to get elected the first time, then he was
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.540]   for same-sex marriage to get elected the second time, and just kind of this flip-flopping.
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:35.540]   And I never understood it.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:41.120]   And when I finally read After the Ball, it just opened my eyes in an astonishing way
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:48.160]   because I realized, "Wait a second, I was a victim of all these societal things.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.760]   I was present for all of these."
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:54.400]   And as a young man, that was an enormous eye-opener for me because it was one of those things
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.600]   where for the first time in your life, when you're young, the world that you're born
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.480]   into is the world that you conceive of.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.960]   If I try to describe to my children how when my dad would come back from a business trip,
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.500]   we would go and wait for him at the gate and he would walk off the jetway and we were there
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.520]   hanging out and giving him a hug.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.540]   They have no concept of that because their entire concept of airports is this elaborate
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.280]   security theater that we all go through all the time.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.920]   And so they will have a hard time believing.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:30.360]   So when you're young, you have a hard time believing that the world was different than
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.840]   how it is in your childhood.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:38.800]   But then as you start to live for a while, you start to see change and you realize that,
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.160]   "Wow, this is different, that's different, this is different."
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:48.380]   And for me, reading that book was just an enormous epiphany.
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:54.380]   And it really impressed me enormously because I could, for the first time, see how societal
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:24:03.240]   change happens and to see how societal change is manipulated and how you and I are manipulated
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.920]   by propaganda and those who desire to change us.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.800]   And sometimes they have good intentions, sometimes they don't.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.000]   You judge for yourself.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.560]   But an awareness of that is really fundamental.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.680]   As part of my homeschooling curriculum for my children, I plan to have a very deep dive
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.840]   into propaganda so that we can understand it so we have a good defense mechanism.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:28.920]   Anyway, that one is the one that I...
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:36.840]   That episode though, I published the episode and then non-stop for the next week, non-stop
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.920]   emails, non-stop comments on the show of, "Josh, you hate gay people, blah, blah, blah,"
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.000]   just never ending.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   And that was good.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   It was hard for me.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   I don't know.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   I think I cried.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   I don't remember.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.720]   I just know it was really hard because I'm a people pleaser.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.080]   I like people to...
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.760]   I want everyone to be happy.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:54.200]   I don't like to disagree with people.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.720]   I don't ever like to tell people they're wrong.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.520]   I'm a people pleaser.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:05.040]   But that experience hardened my skin quite a lot and I was really grateful for it.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.120]   What I find fascinating is passing on since then, 2015, I should go back and listen to
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:17.200]   that show, but here we are almost 10 years later and the trends have only continued and
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:24.760]   we continue to be subjected to the same social manipulation tactics, but I see people waking
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.960]   up and paying attention to that.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.960]   So it'd be interesting.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:30.960]   I haven't listened to that show, but interesting for me to go back and listen to what I actually
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.080]   said and consider it.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.520]   Other controversial ones.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.420]   The only shows that I've only ever deleted in the history of radical personal finance,
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:48.560]   one show, one podcast, and that was the interview that I did with Andrew Tate.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.600]   This was a few years ago and I interviewed Andrew.
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:59.240]   I observe a lot of things and so I try to keep my proverbial fingers in the stream of
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.000]   culture and understand what's happening.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:09.520]   And I saw Andrew and his content coming to the fore and I followed him closely because
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:16.840]   Andrew has some, he's an incredibly smart man and incredibly well-spoken.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:24.680]   He has honed his craft very, very diligently and a lot of his ideas are very, very useful
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.700]   and a lot of them are very appealing.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.040]   So I saw him coming up and I asked him for an interview and he said yes.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:37.480]   And I did it because I've learned now long enough, I've recognized that I'm not bad at
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   seeing trends.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:44.000]   Like I can see trends happening and I can predict with some degree of confidence where
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   they're going.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.020]   I haven't been able to figure out how to apply this to financial markets but I can see this
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.300]   with social trends at least to some degree and so I knew Andrew was getting ready to
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:53.320]   blow up.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:27:01.000]   So I was clout chasing a little bit, asked him for an interview and his background, his
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:11.440]   business, his persona, a lot of his public persona is for shock value.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.900]   He has embraced the idea that there's no such thing as bad publicity but a lot of his background
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.200]   is very distasteful to me but I also felt like he was good at offering ideas.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.760]   Anyway, point is I asked him for an interview and I interviewed him and it was a good interview.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:32.100]   I thought I did a pretty good job with it and I published it and then a couple days
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:37.120]   later I got an email from a listener, this wonderful sweet woman that wrote me a very
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.240]   nice email and talking about persuasion and whatnot, just kind of a textbook case of persuasion
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:50.600]   and she wrote me this story and she said Joshua, I don't fault you for interviewing Andrew
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:58.800]   Tate and talking about interviewing and et cetera and I don't fault you for that but
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.320]   she said let me tell you my story and she told the story of how her daughter from her
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:10.680]   perspective, how her daughter was victimized and was by a predator and was pressured into,
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:16.120]   was basically sex trafficked and had faced all these difficult situations and she, I
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.280]   don't know, I don't remember all the details of the letter.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.920]   What I remember is her tone and she was so kind, she was so respectful, she didn't yell
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.260]   at me, she didn't say take the showdown, she didn't say anything just to share her
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:33.940]   story and then she asked the question, is this who you want to be associated with?
[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:40.840]   And she had just that sweet motherly, grandmotherly tone that it really shook me and I thought
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:46.280]   no, I don't want to be associated with this.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:54.000]   I do, I think today especially, I would say Andrew is a predator and if I'm involved
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:02.300]   in promoting a predator, what moral guilt do I share in that?
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:08.860]   And on the one hand, and I've never solved this because generally speaking, I'm a free
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:13.260]   speech guy, I want to hear from people and so I want journalists to do their job, I want
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.940]   journalists to go and interview nasty evil people, I want psychologists to interview
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:22.560]   people on death row, I read all the terrorist manifestos, like I want to hear what people
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:29.340]   say and what people think because I don't think that we do right when we hide from information
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:33.920]   and I don't know, that just to me is, so I don't like to be the guy who engages in
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:39.060]   censorship, like that's not me, I try not to censor.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:44.680]   But then on the other hand, there is obviously some element of responsibility, so I may go
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:52.060]   and I go and read terrorist manifestos but I don't publish them and so then as a publisher,
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:57.080]   you feel like you have some sense of responsibility and I just, I don't know, so I don't know
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.240]   if I made the right decision, I took the show down and I've gone back and forth and back
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:04.520]   and forth and back and forth on should I publish it, should I not publish it, should I publish
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:11.600]   it, should I not publish it and it's, I could talk about it with my wife, she's like, why
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.060]   do you, just who cares, move on with your life but like, but babe, freedom of speech,
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.560]   like I don't want to be censoring people, it's like, but come on, it is, anyway, I still
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:24.400]   don't know if I did the right thing on taking that down.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:31.240]   It was just a split second decision, it was just the, I don't know, I just imagined talking
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:39.280]   to my mom about it and my mom would say, Joshua, are you really promoting this guy who's made
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.600]   his fortune off of pornography, like that's who you want to be?
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.700]   And I realized that I was clout chasing quite a lot and so who knows, I never figured out
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:54.120]   whether that was the right decision but since I took it down, then I just figured, well,
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.840]   it's down and I told a friend of mine that I was going to put it back up and then I went
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:02.820]   through endless months of deliberations on it and I still don't, I don't know how to
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.820]   reconcile that, those decisions.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.100]   I think if I were doing it over today, I wouldn't have taken it down but that doesn't mean that
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:17.000]   I want to republish it and then the problem was that then at the time, Andrew was controversial
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:26.560]   but not, there wasn't as much evidence of who he really was at that time and to be clear,
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.280]   I'm not ascribing to Andrew legal guilt.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.900]   I believe in innocent until proven guilty in a court of law and even then, legal systems
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:41.800]   can be messed up but I think there's enough evidence that there's abundant court evidence
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:48.580]   to confirm my own assessment that Andrew is a very smart and well-spoken predator and
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.880]   I don't really like predators.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880]   I don't like bullies.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.880]   I don't like predators.
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:57.740]   I don't like people who prey on men and I'm not alleging, for those of you who are big
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:04.040]   Andrew Tate fans, I'm not alleging anything that even based on court documents of his
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:08.840]   alleged crimes, I'm just talking about things from his own mouth of the way that he made
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:14.360]   his money and so as much as I enjoyed the conversation and as much as I thought it was,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   I had tried to walk that line, I don't know, that was the one episode of Radical Personal
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.440]   Finance that I deleted out of a thousand.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.840]   I've deleted probably, I pulled, you know, a few months ago, I pulled a question from
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.280]   a Friday Q&A show because I had answered it poorly.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.400]   Other than that, I don't remember ever deleting anything else.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.400]   It's all there.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:40.040]   Good, bad, ugly, long-winded, crisp, concise, it's all there for you to see and that was
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.320]   always my hope.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.640]   That was always my idea was that, and I said this in the very beginning, I'll leave up
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:51.120]   the early episode so that other people can see that you don't have to be great to start
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.020]   but you got to start to be great and you can go back and you can see early episodes on
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:01.640]   some things I've gotten a lot better, on a few things I've come to the conclusion that
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.600]   I've been standing still.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.600]   Recently my forays into the world of deliberate practice really showed me that I have not
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.760]   been engaging in deliberate practice with my speaking abilities.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.240]   I've been engaging in naive practice, just doing more of the same and not getting better
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.880]   and that annoys me so I'm changing that.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:24.520]   So I intend to be a lot better 10 years from now than I am today.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:30.000]   And so now the obvious concluding transition is, "Alright Joshua, what's next?"
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.080]   I can hear you saying, "Alright, that's all well and interesting and it's kind of fun to
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.800]   talk about old times but after all the past is dead and gone, what's next?
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   What's your plans?"
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:44.200]   Well, I'm going to disappoint you by not publicly telling you what's next but rather just say
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:47.280]   watch and see.
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:55.640]   And the reason is simply that I have learned over the years that ideas are a dime a dozen,
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:01.980]   it's great to talk about plans but it's meaningless, all that matters is execution.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:06.080]   Ideas are a dime a dozen, execution is everything, doing is everything.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.240]   And I've learned that the hard way because being a good talker, I'm also good at talking
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:19.760]   to myself and I've realized and there's some good data behind this from the scientific
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.380]   psychological community but talking about the things that you're going to do gives you
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:30.120]   a little bit of a burst, a little bit of a dopamine hit of, "Hey, this feels good."
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.120]   And you kind of feel like you've achieved something because you've talked about it.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.080]   But then in reality you've achieved nothing and all you've done is talk about it.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.440]   And I've found that this is a great problem for me.
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.760]   It's very easy to say all the things that you're going to do but it's harder to actually
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.520]   do those things.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:55.100]   And this has been a significant form of frustration for me over the past years, especially over
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.400]   the past five to eight years.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.920]   In some ways over the last decade, I felt like I'm swimming in mud instead of swimming
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.260]   in water.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:08.920]   And I can identify a few reasons for them, some explainable and understandable, some
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.740]   not so much.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:19.780]   So one obvious thing is that I have five children and so those responsibilities require time,
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:23.300]   attention, distraction, all of those things.
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:28.420]   And so I'm not as effective of a businessman as I was when I was single on that regard
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:31.360]   just because I have more weight on my shoulders.
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.360]   And it's a good thing.
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:38.240]   I think it drives me to do more, accomplish more, but it also makes it more difficult
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:40.060]   to accomplish.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:41.980]   And so that's been one factor.
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.740]   Another factor is just the fracturing of my mind.
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:53.460]   I've been victimized by the same trends that we all have been victimized of, of fracturing
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:58.920]   of attention, fracturing of our ability to pay attention.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:07.320]   I remember this going back very early and for me, I can clearly remember the world of
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.600]   pre-Firefox tabbed browsing versus post.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.600]   I'm not kidding.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:19.240]   I was in high school when Firefox came out and I think it was them that invented tabbed
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.520]   browsing.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:25.900]   And at the time, my family, we had computers and whatnot before a lot of other people did
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:30.880]   because my dad was a software engineer.
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.860]   But at the time, the internet was a linear function.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:38.980]   And for someone who's interested in everything, the internet was a great boon to me.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.340]   I grew up in a fairly quiet way.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.340]   I read a lot.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:49.760]   We never had a TV in the house, so I didn't have my attention distracted by those things.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.700]   And so I read books and I had an enormously powerful attention span.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:59.980]   And then we had the internet and now I could indulge all of these different interests.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:03.980]   And I distinctly remember when we had the concept of tabbed browsing.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:08.720]   For me, it was the greatest thing in the history of humanity because now, instead of having
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:14.020]   to follow a train of thinking forward and backward, I could click on every shiny little
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:19.540]   thing and I could open up 50 tabs in my browser window or whatever the limit was at that time.
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.280]   And I loved it because I could absorb everything.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.920]   But I noticed how that approach started to harm my attention span.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:37.280]   I noticed that I would be halfway down a web page and now I was just bored and I would
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:42.360]   click to the next web page, click to the next tab in the browser.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.400]   And I didn't like how that felt.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.480]   And I started very early at that time to try to pay attention to it and be careful of it.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:56.680]   And over the years, I've had times of advancement and times of retrenchment, of more distracted,
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.280]   less distracted.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.640]   But in some ways, over the last 10 years, it's been a fight and I think it seems like
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:03.640]   it's a fight for all of us.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:07.280]   It's not just me because not only is it now we have tabbed browsing, but now we have endless
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.340]   opportunities for distraction.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:16.400]   And so cultivating the ability to do important, meaningful work without distraction and cultivating
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.800]   the ability to pay attention to hard work, that's a never-ending challenge.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.400]   And I'm doing my very best, but I am frustrated with my results at times.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:33.820]   And I guess the final reason would simply be one of the great challenges of an entrepreneur
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:35.680]   is to know what to do.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:42.800]   Again, when I think about the swimming in mud, a big portion of it is basically represented
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:49.640]   by me sitting at my desk having a bazillion things I could do and seeing how every single
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:55.040]   one of them could be successful and could lead me in the direction that I want to go
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.240]   and not knowing how to choose among them.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.280]   And that's very different than a job.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.920]   In a job, your boss says, "Here, do this."
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.560]   Or if you are a leader in the company, you come together with other people, you talk
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.160]   to the boss and the boss says, "We want to go in this direction," you talk about plans
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.420]   and you commit and say, "This is what we're going to do."
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:19.880]   But as a solopreneur, you can go in any number of directions and you can change on a dime
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.960]   and you can pivot and you can switch and you can do all kinds of things.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:29.160]   And as a very creative person who's good at coming up with ideas, I am king of sitting
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:33.760]   down and writing a list of ideas and they all sound super new and enthusiastic and exciting
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.000]   to me.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.800]   And interestingly, kind of a classic cycle for me goes basically like this.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:42.520]   I have the idea to write a tweet.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.720]   So I sit down to write a tweet and then I start writing the tweet and I realize, "You
[01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:46.720]   know what?
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.520]   This is probably a good podcast episode."
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.360]   So I expand my tweet into a podcast episode.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.120]   Then as I'm in the middle of writing the outline for the podcast episode, I realize, "Nah,
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.280]   this is not an episode.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.760]   This is a series.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.360]   Because wouldn't this be a great series?"
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:04.560]   So I start expanding into a series and then I realize I've got such good stuff that I'm
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:06.620]   like, "This should be a course.
[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:10.120]   Like if I just created a course on this, that'd be so much more helpful."
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:13.480]   And so then as I'm most of the way into the course, then I'm like, "No, you know what?
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.860]   Instead of a course, this should be an entirely different brand.
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:19.840]   Like this would just be amazing business if I built this."
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.280]   So then I go and buy a URL for the brand and stick it into my stable of URLs.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:30.200]   And then it's such a big project that I don't know where to begin.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:36.920]   And so I just quit because I've got 30 pages of notes on something that could be its own
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.840]   brand and I don't even have a tweet.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.640]   And so I hope that you'll laugh at me because it's ridiculous to say it out loud, but I
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:47.080]   believe in honesty.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.720]   But that's basically the experience that I've had of so many things.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:55.000]   I've got a dozen courses with dozens and dozens of pages of notes, of outlines, of these elaborate
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.760]   things that I have built of great content.
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.080]   And then I've been frustrated by my ability to get that stuff out and serve anybody with
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.840]   it because, "Oh, it's so good.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.180]   It should be its own separate thing."
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:17.160]   So as me trying to deal with that, I have told myself to stop talking about things that
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:23.880]   I'm going to do and just do stuff and then talk about what I've done and to do the same
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.520]   thing to myself as well.
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:31.900]   So I still set goals and ambitions, but I'm trying to avoid the deadly trap of thinking
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:36.440]   that you made progress just because you wrote your goals down or talking about your goals
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.640]   because that's something that I think really happens.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.800]   You say, "This is what I'm going to do," and you feel great because you talked about
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.040]   what you're going to do.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   But now that you feel great, you move on to something else because you talked about it.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.460]   And in reality, talking about it doesn't matter.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.720]   The ideas don't matter.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.880]   The only thing that matters is execution, execution, doing, doing, doing, doing.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.380]   And that's been something that I'm doing.
[01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:09.800]   So as an expression of that, forgive me if I just simply sidestep the question about
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:11.800]   what are Joshua's plans?
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.520]   What is Joshua going to do and watch me and come along for the ride?
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:27.640]   And with that, I want to close with just a very genuine thank you because I have been
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:30.900]   extremely fortunate in my life.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.360]   I've been extremely blessed.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:36.640]   And if I reflect on the last 10 years, it's been an adventure.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.880]   And it's been an adventure if I had to make the same decision over again, I would make
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.960]   the same decision over again.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:48.000]   Even though not everything has worked out like I've liked, there's been a lot of disappointment,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.600]   a lot of pain, a lot of frustration, a lot of disillusionment, all kinds of negative
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   stuff.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.720]   But at the end of the day, I'm proud of what I've done.
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.840]   I'm proud of myself for saying what I was going to do and then doing it.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.160]   I'm proud of myself for sticking through it when it's been difficult.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:17.120]   I'm proud of myself for sticking to my guns and not backing down.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.160]   Even if I was wrong, even if I want to change, I'm not going to just do that.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.880]   And that's been the hardest thing for me.
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.480]   I have not enjoyed being a public figure.
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.880]   And it's not because of anything that you've done, it's just that it's uncomfortable.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:36.020]   It's uncomfortable to know that your words and your ideas impact others.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:40.480]   It's uncomfortable to know that if you're wrong on something and you persuaded someone
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.120]   to have something and then you have to say you're wrong, that's really uncomfortable.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:50.520]   I haven't enjoyed having all of my ideas on record in terms of what that means because
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.800]   sometimes you'd like to go and erase the past.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:56.720]   And I've certainly thought many times about just doing that.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:04.440]   I've thought many times about deleting everything and disappearing into obscurity again.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.280]   That is an option and it's a very attractive option to me.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.060]   I don't crave fame in any way, shape, or form.
[01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:20.400]   I run from it and I consciously do things that try to avoid it, to avoid it.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:28.280]   However, because of you and the wonderful relationship that I've built with you over
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.660]   the years, I'm not going to do that.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:33.720]   I'm not going to disappear from the internet.
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:45.080]   I'm going to keep pressing forward because I believe that I need to put as simply as that.
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.360]   I believe that I need to and I want to.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.640]   I want to be useful in this world.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.440]   I want to be useful to you.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:45:02.080]   I want to serve you and I want to be useful in my corner of the world to see, to do something
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:09.640]   if at all possible, to see to the flourishing and the betterment of my fellow man.
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:17.800]   And I want to see our world continue on an arc towards justice and righteousness and
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:20.440]   peace and prosperity.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:26.320]   I want to see people living satisfied lives, contented lives.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:31.000]   I want to see families prosper and thrive.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:39.520]   I want to see young people grow up and in safety and security and surrounded by love,
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.120]   free of trauma, able to expand in the world.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:52.280]   I want to see, I want to see a further expression of the kingdom of God in this world.
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.400]   I want to see a furthering of human flourishing.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.720]   I want to see poverty eradicated.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.660]   I want to see peace brought on a global basis.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.480]   Now obviously I think we all do, right?
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:08.100]   Those are things that we all do.
[01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.640]   We all want to see that.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.880]   And it's one thing to want something and it's another thing to actually do it.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:23.480]   But if you want to see something happen, then the most rewarding and fulfilling thing that
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.540]   you can do is to work at making it happen.
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:32.000]   Because while we all acknowledge that it's unlikely that the fullness of any of these
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.540]   things will occur within a single lifetime or within because of a single person's efforts,
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:42.400]   that doesn't diminish the importance of the task.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:47.800]   It doesn't diminish the importance of a single person laboring in obscurity because that
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:54.640]   person may be even unknowingly laying a road, a pathway for someone else to follow who picks
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.100]   up their work and moves on.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:08.080]   And we want to see, and while it may be frustrating how limited we are on a daily basis or a weekly
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:14.500]   basis or a yearly basis, when you reflect on something like a decade, you can see that
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.620]   some progress can be made in a decade.
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:20.840]   And that's exciting.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:28.640]   And when you recognize that most of us may have five or six decades of, or more hopefully,
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:36.160]   five to eight decades of productivity within us, then that's enough time to feel like we
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:39.400]   can make a difference in something.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:46.320]   I am very grateful to have made a difference with my decade of work.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.120]   I have a smile file of the many notes that I've received telling me about the difference
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:52.120]   that I've made.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.760]   And I know that that's real.
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:56.540]   And I really am grateful for that.
[01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:04.360]   And so when I look forward and I think about what could possibly be accomplished in another
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:08.040]   five decades of work, then I start to get excited.
[01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:17.240]   And that's really what I want to do is I want to feel like my work is useful to other people
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:20.680]   in accomplishing that global vision that we all have.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:25.680]   And I mean global as a-- anyway, I don't have to define all my terms.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.980]   So I just want to say thank you because the fact that you're here listening to me right
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:40.580]   now is rewarding, and I will do my best to try to find, uncover, and teach the most useful
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:43.700]   impactful ideas that I'm able to find.
[01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:47.320]   And I hope that you will take those ideas, build on them, and then turn around and teach
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.960]   me and implement them and teach your neighbor.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.980]   That's always been my goal.
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.280]   And then along the way, I have been able to live a very rewarding lifestyle because of
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280]   it.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.180]   And I'm very grateful for that as well.
[01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:02.080]   I don't take that for granted as well.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:10.440]   I live a very rewarding lifestyle, fairly simple, fairly quiet, but I find it very rewarding
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   as well.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.320]   And it's something where I'm just grateful the opportunities we have.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.260]   We live in such an amazing time to be alive.
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:23.600]   If I got picked up and plucked back in 100 years ago or 300 years ago, my life decisions
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.520]   and life choices would be very limited.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:31.280]   I'd probably be hoeing my row of corn somewhere in the world.
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:35.940]   And I'm sure there are many great things about that, but that doesn't appeal to me, doesn't
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:36.940]   appeal to me at all.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:42.900]   And so the many modern choices that we have of how we live in today's world are overwhelming
[01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:44.940]   at times, but they're very rewarding.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.620]   So I just want to say thank you.
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:52.420]   Thank you for being here, and I really appreciate you, and I'll be back with you very soon.
