[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540]   Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.300]   Today, my guest is Dr. Rina Malik.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.740]   Dr. Rina Malik is a board-certified urologist and pelvic surgeon.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.940]   She is an expert in both male and female urological, pelvic floor, and sexual health. During today's episode, Dr.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.940]   Malik answers the most commonly asked questions about urinary pelvic and sexual health.
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.340]   For instance, how to avoid getting UTI's, urinary tract infections.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.000]   We also discuss pelvic floor anatomy and function as it relates to
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   overcoming an overly tight or an overly relaxed pelvic floor.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.420]   This is a key distinction that most people aren't aware of. Many people hear about the need to so-called strengthen their pelvic floor,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.000]   but in fact, many people need to do the exact opposite. They need to learn to relax their pelvic floor in order to achieve proper
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.760]   urologic and sexual function. So today you'll learn about that. You will also learn about sexual health as it relates to
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.720]   erectile function, as it relates to things like vaginal lubrication, as it relates to orgasm. We separate out very carefully the difference between
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.840]   psychological desire and
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.100]   arousal that occurs within the genitals themselves. And Dr. Malik highlights some important misconceptions about sexual dysfunction.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.880]   For instance, that many people believe that hormones are responsible for sexual dysfunction, but in reality,
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.600]   hormone dysregulation is responsible for only a very small percentage of sexual dysfunction and yet
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   pelvic floor and blood flow related issues can account for a large number of cases of
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   sexual dysfunction in both males and females.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.840]   So I assure you that today's discussion is going to illuminate many new areas of information,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.160]   many new tools and protocols that I'm guessing most people have not heard of. We talk about the neural
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.120]   vascular, that is blood flow related, and
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   muscular aspects of bladder function, prostate function, skeins, glands.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.380]   We talk about vaginal health as well as penile health.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.280]   We talk about these things as it relates to different stages across the lifespan.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.200]   It is a far-reaching and in-depth and practical conversation that I'm certain everyone will glean
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.920]   important takeaways from. Now before we go any further, I do want to highlight that the content of today's episode is
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.040]   sexual in nature.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160]   We talk very directly about
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.360]   different types of sexual behavior and we talk about it from the standpoint of the clinician and biologist.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.400]   So it is a medical/scientific discussion. That said, we can't be aware of where this podcast is being played and who is listening and
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.600]   I assert that there are certain themes within today's discussion that would not be suitable for young children.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.660]   How young? Well, that is certainly not for us to discern. We realize that different parents and different households
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.800]   should be the arbiters of what sorts of information their children are exposed to or not.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.900]   So my suggestion would be that if you have any concern whatsoever
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.180]   that the content of today's episode would not be appropriate to be heard by some member of your family,
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.740]   that you please listen to the podcast first or at least check the time stamps where we've detailed what specific topics are covered and
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.100]   then to make your decision accordingly. I should mention that not only is Dr. Malik still an active clinician,
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.560]   she sees patients daily out of her clinic in Southern California, and we provided a link to that clinic in the show note captions.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.600]   She's also authored dozens of high-quality peer-reviewed publications in the fields of urology, pelvic health, and sexual health.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.020]   And we've also provided a link to that bibliography in the show note captions. And she is also a spectacular public educator.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.280]   She provides zero-cost content
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.560]   about sexual health, pelvic floor health, and urology as it relates to both men and women on her YouTube channel. And there, too,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.460]   we provided a link to Dr. Malik's YouTube channel in the show note captions to this episode.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.980]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero-cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.360]   In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.700]   Our first sponsor is Roca. Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.120]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend with
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.540]   an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.920]   Roca understands this and has developed their eyeglasses and sunglasses so that you always see with perfect clarity. In addition,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.740]   they are extremely lightweight and they won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.580]   Indeed, Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed for performance in sports,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.680]   but now they include aesthetics and styles that are really designed to be worn anytime. I, for instance, wear readers at night.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   I'll sometimes wear sunglasses during the day when I drive and, of course, I do not wear sunglasses when I do my morning sunlight viewing,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.480]   which I highly recommend everyone do their morning sunlight viewing. If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.420]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com, and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.020]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com, enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.620]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep. Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are customized to your unique sleep.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.620]   They are a great way to get the best possible night's sleep. Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.620]   When we are sleeping well and enough, mental health, physical health, and performance all stand to be at their best.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.120]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   Helix Sleep has a brief two-minute quiz that if you go to their website, you take that quiz and answer questions such as,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.620]   "Do you tend to sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach? Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?"
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.620]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions, and that's fine.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.620]   At the end of that two-minute quiz, they will match you to a mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.620]   I sleep on the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress, and when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.620]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress, go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.120]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you, and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order and two free pillows.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.620]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.620]   We are always striving to make the Huberman Lab Podcast better, and to that end, we need your help.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   Over the next month, we are going to be carrying out a survey.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620]   The purpose of the survey is to improve the Huberman Lab Podcast according to your feedback.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.120]   We put together a brief survey to understand what you love about the podcast, hopefully you love a few things at least,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.620]   or maybe just one thing, as well as what you think could be improved, or perhaps the many things that you think could be improved about the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.620]   Basically, what we are asking is to get your feedback so that we can improve any and all things about the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.620]   The survey does not take long, and every single response will be reviewed.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.620]   As a thank you for completing the survey, we are offering two months free of the Huberman Lab Premium Channel.
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:23.620]   If you are already a member of the Huberman Lab Premium Channel, do not worry, you will get an additional two free months for carrying out this survey.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:30.120]   You can find the link to the survey in the show notes for this podcast episode and on our website, HubermanLab.com.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.120]   So if you would be so kind as to take a few minutes to fill out the survey and help us continue with bringing you the best possible content here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.620]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:47.120]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Rina Malik. Dr. Rina Malik, welcome.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.620]   Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor to be here.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.620]   I'm delighted to have you here. I'm a huge fan of your content.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:05.620]   I find that you are able to deliver critical information about sexual health, urology, pelvic floor, libido, and so many other things that are of immense interest to people,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.120]   but that ordinarily people don't really know where to get the high quality information.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   And coming to you for that information means they are going to get the highest quality information.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.620]   I truly believe that because as everyone will soon hear today, we're going to have a very frank discussion,
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:30.120]   but one that's really grounded in science and medicine around sexual health and related topics.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   These are topics that typically people learn about, perhaps a little bit in school,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   maybe at home, from friends, usually overhearing things as opposed to direct exploratory conversation,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:51.120]   online, pornography, and at least in my experience growing up, you know,
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   there was education around sexual health, reproductive health, et cetera,
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:02.120]   that was more oriented toward the fear of things like STIs, fear of unwanted pregnancy.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.120]   All of which, of course, is extremely important for people to learn about.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   But far less about sort of the healthy versions of sexual health, right?
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120]   - So this is an especially important conversation.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   It's also one that I think has a backdrop that we should just acknowledge right off the bat,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.120]   that because the information is gleaned from multiple sources
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   and because there are, let's just say influences out there that relate to the morality of different practices,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   that there can be shame, there can be misunderstanding, there can be secrecy,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   and that further leads to misinformation.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   So I'm confident that today you can clarify things for us and we're going to stay out of those trenches.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   And the last thing I'd like to say is that because a number of terms will certainly come up
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.120]   and I think for some people they're not used to hearing and general discourse,
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   I'm just going to get them out of the way now.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   Penis, vagina, anus, prostate, you know, what else is there?
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   We're going to talk about libido.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   We're going to talk about intercourse, oral sex, anal sex.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   We're going to talk about all of that.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   So I just want to get that out there so that we can reduce the shock response.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   - I love it.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   We're going to talk about all of it.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.120]   - Great.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.120]   So to start off in anticipation of this episode, I solicited for questions on social media
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   and I got thousands of questions, but there was a lot of overlap in the questions.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   So to start off, I'd like to talk about pelvic floor, okay?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   Because both males and females have a pelvic floor.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   And my understanding is that there's a muscular component, there's a neuromuscular component,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   there's a blood flow component.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   What is a healthy pelvic floor?
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   What does a healthy pelvic floor do?
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:57.120]   And then we can talk about some of the health issues that an unhealthy pelvic floor creates
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.120]   and some of the ways to ameliorate an unhealthy pelvic floor.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   So a pelvic floor very simply is basically a bowl of muscles that's connected to bones
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   that hold up all your organs.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   So basically in your pelvis, there's all these muscles there.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   And their function is essentially many.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   It helps with urination, defecation, sexual function.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   It helps with posture.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.120]   And so having a strong, healthy pelvic floor can mean that you're having normal urination,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   you're having normal defecation, you're having great sex,
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   and that you are also not having ailments like back pain or issues related to those functions
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   and those organs.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.120]   And so, you know, pelvic floor is so important in so many different aspects
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   and we deal with it a lot as urologists because it's so integral to these functions
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   that we take care of.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.120]   And so when you have an unhealthy pelvic floor, it can vary from person to person.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.120]   And while you hear about it a lot in women, men also suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   or problems with the pelvic floor.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   So basically pelvic floor dysfunction happens a lot when you're doing things like
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   if you were to go to the gym and do repetitions of any sort of exercise and you didn't rest,
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.120]   then that muscle would become contracted and short.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   Very similarly, if your pelvic floor is overstrained, it can become contracted and short
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.120]   and tight all the time.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   And you may not know it.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   It may just be a function of stress, anxiety, or overuse, or posture problems,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   things of that nature that can affect your pelvic floor.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   And so this can lead to issues.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120]   Let's start with urination.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   You can have symptoms of urgency, frequency, meaning you have to go a lot to the bathroom
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   or you have to go and have a sudden desire that you can't delay, sometimes even have leakage.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   In some cases, it can make it difficult to urinate because the pelvic floor is so tense.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.120]   Or perhaps to incompletely vacate the bladder.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   Correct.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   Like you go to urinate and then you go back to your desk
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.120]   and then five minutes later you have to urinate again.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   Exactly.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.120]   Well, it can be either that you're not emptying completely
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   or that the pelvic floor muscles are so tense that they're stimulating the bladder
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.120]   so it feels like there's more to go.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   So it's not always that you're not evacuating.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.120]   It can present in a number of different ways.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:19.120]   And then with sexual function, if it's very tense, you can have pain.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   So you can have pain with sex.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   You can have pain with erections.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   You can have pain with ejaculation.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   Sometimes it can be a lot of different kind of pain syndromes
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   and you're like I have all these different things going on
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.120]   and it's really just pelvic floor dysfunction.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.120]   With GI function, you can definitely have constipation
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   and then often you can also have back pain.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   And so all of these things can happen when your pelvic floor is too tense.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.120]   Sometimes your pelvic floor can be too weak
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   and that can be often because of -- we see this in women a lot --
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.120]   because of childbirth, delivering children.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   With some people who have neurologic disorders,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.120]   they can have weak pelvic floors or connective tissue disorders
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, for example.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   These sorts of things can cause weakness to the pelvic floor
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.120]   which can then cause very often what I see
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   is like urinary incontinence or leakage
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   which can then create problems for people down the line.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.120]   Thank you for that.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   So first question, how does somebody know if their pelvic floor is too tight
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.120]   from an over-contraction or chronic contraction of the muscles there
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.120]   versus too weak?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.120]   And one of the challenges in having this conversation
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.120]   is that if we were talking about contraction of the calf muscle or the bicep,
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120]   I think everyone intuitively knows
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   because they've seen the shortening of the muscles
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   when the muscle is "flexed"
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.120]   and the lengthening of the muscles when it is relaxed.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.120]   Is there a way to describe pelvic floor muscular shortening
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   in a way that everyone can understand?
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.120]   Would this be like -- like I said, we're going to be direct today --
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.120]   would this be like tensing up one's anus
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.120]   and the opposite of the movement that one would do
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   before initiating a bowel movement
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   and relaxation is sort of the pattern of pelvic floor muscular relaxation
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   just prior to initiating bowel movement?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   So I will say most people can't recognize it
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   because it's very difficult to notice.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   It's sort of gradual.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   And so it can over time become noticeable with these symptoms.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.120]   But otherwise it's very difficult
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   because it's not a muscle that we were ever trained to recognize, right?
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.120]   Like you hear about Kegel exercises, for example,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   and people talk about how to do them,
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   but that's all you ever hear about the pelvic floor.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   And so you don't really know how to kind of do things in a way
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   that protects your pelvic floor
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   or kind of what -- how to even tell when it's too tight or not relaxing.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   And so that takes sort of a training.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   And so usually when people come --
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   first you get an examination to see if your pelvic floor is tight.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   So for women it's a pelvic exam and for men it's usually a rectal exam.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   How does that exam go?
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   So it's essentially palpating the muscles and also looking at the function.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.120]   So we'll say --
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   So digital palpation, that's a medical technology for fingers,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   they're called digits.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   So I'm old enough to recognize what a digital prostate exam is, right?
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   The physician inserts their fingers into the anus
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   and feels the prostate to see whether or not it's swollen or not.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.120]   And as I'm saying this I'm realizing sometimes we think of medicine,
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   "modern medicine" is so evolved.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.120]   This has basically been the practice for what, 50 years, 60 years,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   maybe 100 years in the same way that the old school practice for glaucoma,
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   excessive eye pressure, was for the physician to just touch the eyeball.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.120]   So folks, for those of you that think that medicine has evolved much,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.120]   it clearly has in many ways.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   But in any event, so a prostate exam goes as I just described.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   What would a pelvic floor exam for a male
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:00.120]   and a pelvic floor exam for a female involve at a kind of granular level?
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   Yeah, so for women you can feel the pelvic floor muscles through the vagina.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.120]   So you can feel the iliococcygeus, the pubococcygeus, the levator, ani,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   those are all names of different muscles in this bowl.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.120]   This is the physician who can feel them with their fingers.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   Correct, and you could too, you could put your finger in,
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   but you don't have a reference of normal, right?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   So you wouldn't know what a normal pelvic floor feels like
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   versus a tight one versus a weak one.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   And so you can assess the tenseness based on palpation,
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.120]   you can also see if there's tenderness,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.120]   and so you can assess that based on just a general physical examination.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   And then also you can observe.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.120]   So I can say contract your, squeeze your pelvic floor up and in,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   I can look and see are they squeezing or are they pushing,
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   like are they coordinated or not, right?
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.120]   Because that's a function of normal use of the pelvic floor
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.120]   and sometimes you'll see that they're just coordinated.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   You can also assess for sensation in the area and things like that
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.120]   that could be consequences of dysfunction.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.120]   Could there be dysfunction in laterality,
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   like the pelvic floor is pulling up and to the right or up and to the left?
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   Absolutely.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.120]   So what typically when you see a pelvic floor therapist,
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.120]   now I'm not a pelvic floor therapist,
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   but these are the people who do the work, right?
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   They work with you on a prolonged basis
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.120]   to help you normalize the function of your pelvic floor.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.120]   It's like going to the gym with a trainer, right?
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.120]   They really work with you to get your pelvic floor functioning correctly.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.120]   And the first step to that, a lot of pelvic floor therapists
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   will just align your bones and your kind of the way you sit and walk
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.120]   to make sure that you're not straining those muscles
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   by pulling in different directions.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:39.120]   And if a male goes to the physician to get a pelvic floor exam,
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   there's obviously difficulty in putting fingers into the urethra,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   one would hope, too small an opening.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   So how are they doing the pelvic floor exam?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   Is it external to the body or is it through the anus?
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   So some of it's through the anus.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.120]   You could feel the muscles through the anus
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.120]   and then you can feel the perineal area
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   and feel the muscles there as well as sensations.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   So perineal area, so from the outside of the body?
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   Correct.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   The region between the scrotum and the anus?
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   Yes.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   Okay.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   So it sounds to me like if people want to get a high quality assessment
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.120]   of whether or not their pelvic floor is healthy or not,
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   they need to see a pelvic floor specialist,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   that it's not the sort of thing that they could into on their own necessarily.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120]   It would be difficult.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   I mean, so there are things you can buy online,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   like probes that you can insert in the vagina
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   that will teach you how to do Kegel exercises and give you some readings,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   but they're not really meant to diagnose.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.120]   They're usually something people use if they say have a weak pelvic floor
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   and they want to try to do it at home on their own.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   So there's nothing that's going to give you like a baseline reading,
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   is this normal or abnormal?
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.120]   Let's talk about Kegels.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   First of all, who's Kegel?
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.120]   So he is a gynecologist.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.120]   I don't remember all the specifics to be quite honest,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   but basically he came up with Kegels,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   which are a strengthening exercise for the pelvic floor.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.120]   And so what it is, what we describe it to for patients is we say,
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.120]   there's a few different ways to describe it.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   You're going to use the muscles that you use when you urinate,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   but try to stop the flow.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   But you don't want to do them when you're urinating
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   because that can create dysfunction.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   You want to learn what the muscles are and then you squeeze those muscles
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   and relax in between sets, so to speak.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   And so the other way people describe it is pulling up and in in the vagina,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.120]   or for men, sometimes you'll say it's like the feeling
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.120]   that you're trying to lift your penis off the floor without touching it.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   So those are kind of using--
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   That's a good way to describe it.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   So those are kind of the ways that you can describe those muscles
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   and so you can squeeze for five seconds and relax for five seconds
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   and do them in repetitions.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   And they're just like any sort of exercise you do.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   You don't want to start doing 100 of them, right?
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.120]   You want to do them--
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.120]   I tell patients, do them lying down
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   so that you're only focusing on those muscles.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   You're not working on your posture, you're not doing anything else.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   And as you get better with them lying down, you then sit up and do them
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   and then once you're good with them sitting up, you can do them standing
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   and start with, you know, 10 to 15 at a time.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   Like once in the morning.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   10 to 15 repetitions.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   So yeah, let's talk sets and reps.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   So yeah, 10 to 15 repetitions in the morning,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.120]   10 to 15 repetitions at night,
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   maybe one more during the middle of the day.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   But don't overdo it because just like anything,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   especially when you're starting out, you can.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   And if you're doing tons and tons of Kegels,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   then you will get a tight, short pelvic floor muscles
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   and you will then develop pelvic floor dysfunction.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   So it's really important to kind of understand those mechanics,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   which is why a lot of people think they know how to do Kegels,
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.120]   but they really don't.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.120]   And so I always encourage people if you have the time
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.120]   and the resources to go to a pelvic floor physical therapist
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   so they can really work with you and make sure you're doing them correctly.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   What are some of the benefits of Kegels for those that need them?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   Yes, so they are typically prescribed for urinary incontinence,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   specifically stress urinary incontinence.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   So leakage that occurs when you have an increase in your intraabdominal pressure
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   like a Valsalva or coughing, sneezing, lifting heavy things,
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   jumping on a trampoline.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   So for those purposes, we use Kegels to strengthen the pelvic floor
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   and also in women, pelvic organ prolapse.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   So when you have weakness of the pelvic floor that leads to a bulge
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   that you can visibly see or feel in the vagina.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.120]   For men, we often prescribe them for people who have had a prostatectomy
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   who then subsequently develop leakage after the prostatectomy
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   that is, again, stress urinary incontinence.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   Now a lot of people use Kegels recreationally
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   because improving the pelvic floor musculature
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.120]   can lead to more intense pelvic floor contractions during orgasm
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   which can be more pleasurable.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.120]   And so some people do it for those purposes,
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   but again I caution people not to overdo it
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.120]   because then you can lead to a more tense pelvic floor
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   which is not where we want to end up.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   Yes, I will underscore that cautionary note.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   Years ago, I heard about Kegels.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   I was like, okay, I'll try it.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   It sounds all good, right?
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   I only heard good things about Kegels
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   and what it quickly resulted in was painful urination.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   And I thought, this is weird.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.120]   Everyone's saying Kegels are so great.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.120]   And the best thing I could do for my pelvic floor, it seemed,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   was to avoid Kegels.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.120]   Yes.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   And a little bit later, when we're talking about prostate,
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   I'll explain at least what my experience was as it relates to the prostate.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   But I guess the take-home message that I'm gathering from what you're telling us
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:38.120]   is that strengthening the pelvic floor is great if you have a weak pelvic floor.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   Strengthening your pelvic floor further
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   if you have a strong pelvic floor can be detrimental.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   It can be. It can be if you overtrain it,
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   just like if you overtrain anything else.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   And so you just have to, if you really want to do Kegels,
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.120]   if you have any symptoms at all,
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   like you described, painful urination or the things I've described,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:02.120]   like pain with erections, pain with ejaculation, pain difficulty emptying,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.120]   any of those symptoms, stop and go see a urologist
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   so that they can kind of assess your pelvic floor.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   What is the anti-Kegel?
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   In other words, if somebody decides that they have a tight pelvic floor,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.120]   how can they learn to relax their pelvic floor?
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   So there's a lot of different sort of things that you can do.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   So for women, you can do massage of the area.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   You can use vaginal dilators to help relax the muscles.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   You can take suppositories that have medications like Valium or Baclofen,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.120]   which are muscle relaxants, and that can help as well.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   Although they're not treatments, they're more of a Band-Aid,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   but they can help with the symptoms that you're having.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.120]   And then you can also--I think the best thing is to work with a physical therapist
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   because they can teach you certain exercises that will help down train the pelvic floor.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   For example, one of the ones I tell my patients is like happy baby pose.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.120]   It actually, you know, stretches and elongates the pelvic floor muscles.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   So doing these exercises regularly will help you lengthen the pelvic floor muscles.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   One thing that I've experienced extreme pain from
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.120]   and that stopping was one of the best things that ever happened for my pelvic floor
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   was to not do any kind of crunching movement with my legs crossed.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   I would go to these yoga classes at one point in my life,
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   and they'd have everybody do these crunches,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   and I've always done some abdominal work here and there during the week if I'm being diligent,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   but they would have us cross our feet,
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   and that seemed to lead to some pelvic floor discomfort
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   that was similar to what I had experienced when I did the Kegels.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.120]   So again, for me, ceasing the Kegels was one of the best decisions I ever made.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   I only did them for a short while. I was like, "Okay, this is clearly not for me."
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   And I guess that's another point that tell me if you agree or not
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   that if you hear about something online or on this podcast or anywhere else
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   and you try it and it seems to be sending things in the wrong direction,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   either you're doing it wrong or it might not be the right thing for you.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   I think all too often we hear, "This thing is great,"
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   and people jump on that bandwagon and then they end up worsening their problems
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   or developing problems where they didn't have them previously.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   But is there anything about the anatomy of the neuromuscular connections
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   or vasculature of the pelvic floor that would provide support for my experience there?
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.120]   That doing crunches with legs crossed is essentially--
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   is it possible that it's creating asymmetries in the pelvic floor?
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   And now I'm sure I'm angering yoga teachers and crunchanistas everywhere,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   but hey, if it's a question of your pelvic floor or a few extra delineations in your abs,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   you know where my vote's going.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   So there's a couple things here that we should dive into.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   One is that people don't often breathe correctly during exercise, right?
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   And so diaphragmatic breathing is really important,
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   which is like a deep breath that expands the diaphragm,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   not kind of shallow breathing, but just in your mouth and throat.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   And that is actually when you do any sort of exercise,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   your trainer will tell you exhale on the effort, right?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   And there's a reason for that because when you inhale, your pelvic floor relaxes.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   When you exhale, your pelvic floor contracts.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   And so actually that contraction stabilizes the pelvic floor.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   So whatever intraabdominal pressure you're causing to increase from the exercise,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   whether it's a squat or a crunch or whatever,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   you're increasing your abdominal pressure,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.120]   your pelvic floor is then contracting to help stabilize that.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   And so part of the reason people tend to hold their breath during crunches, right?
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   They don't do the appropriate breathing and so that can be part of it.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   The other thing that can happen with certain things is that there are nerves and arteries,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   particularly the pudendal nerve and the pudendal artery that run through the pelvic floor.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   So when you get pelvic floor dysfunction,
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   you can cause decreased blood flow to the pelvic floor muscles,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.120]   which can affect sexual function,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   and you can get nerve inflammation as well that can also cause pain.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   And so this is kind of how it all comes together.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   I'm so glad that you mentioned blood flow.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   I think our entire discussion today should be framed up,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.120]   at least in the back of our minds and the minds of our listeners and viewers,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.120]   as involving at least three things.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   You know, anytime we're talking about erectile function or dysfunction
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   or pelvic floor function or dysfunction or vaginal lubrication or lack thereof,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   we need to think about the hormonal influences,
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   the blood flow related influences and the neural influences,
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   including the neural influences that come from the brain,
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   the signals of arousal, for instance, or lack of arousal and so on.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   So we won't be overly systematic in our parsing of all this,
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   but I think what you just mentioned raises a really important point
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   that sometimes in an effort to do something that's good for the muscles,
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   like strengthen the muscles, one will cut off blood flow.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   In fact, one of the more common questions I got,
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.120]   and I consulted with a couple of exercise physiologists about this,
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   and they confirmed that a lot of people who squat and deadlift heavy in the gym
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   or even who just tense their pelvic floor
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   when they're doing things like dumbbell curls or other exercises,
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   and especially people who seem to do a lot of abdominal work,
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   reported to me in the questions that they experienced things like erectile dysfunction,
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   that they experienced things like pain during vaginal intercourse,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   that essentially they had created some sort of what sounds to me
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   like a hyper contraction of the muscles in that area
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   that were impeding all the things that they wanted
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   as either side effects or direct effects of exercise
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   because many people are exercising for aesthetic reasons and health reasons,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   but nowadays it seems especially on the male side,
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   but we will also talk about the role of testosterone on the female side,
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   a lot of males lift weights in order to increase their testosterone
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   and for reasons that are obvious also want to have healthy sexual function,
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   and here they are doing this thing that's very good for increasing testosterone
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   if they're doing it correctly,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   and testosterone is involved in libido and the male sexual response
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   and the female sexual response, of course,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.120]   but they are impeding their erections.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.120]   So you can start to see how there are probably a lot of confused
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   and maybe even distraught people out there.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   They're trying to do all the right things and they're setting up roadblocks
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   and even sending themselves backward in some cases.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:33.120]   So the question is how does one know whether or not something like,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.120]   let's say, low lubrication or pain during vaginal intercourse
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   or loss of erectile strength or some sort of erectile dysfunction,
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   or maybe because it can take on different forms as we'll talk about,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   how does one know if it's blood flow related, hormone related,
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.120]   or neural related?
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   And if it's neural related, how does one know if it's an issue
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   of lack of appropriate signals from the brain,
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   oversuppression or lack of arousal from the brain,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   or whether or not it's some peripheral neural thing of innervation
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   of the penis or vagina?
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   So I think there's a lot that we can go into here,
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   but essentially first you want to find out like very specifically
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.120]   what is going on.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   Are you getting aroused?
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   Are you having erections?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   Are you masturbating?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   Like there's all these questions that will help us go down the route.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   When you say aroused, for sake of this discussion,
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.120]   I just want to make sure that we distinguish between psychological arousal,
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.120]   the desire to, I guess here we also have to be precise,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   arousal to engage in intercourse and arousal to desire, essentially,
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   that I think people would learn to recognize.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.120]   Or are we talking about arousal as the response of the genitals?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   - Correct.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   So desire and arousal, this is a very important concept,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.120]   doesn't always go in one direction.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.120]   Sometimes you can feel arousal,
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   meaning you have the telltale signs of arousal.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   Your nipples get erect.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   You have more lubrication if you're a female.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.120]   - Do both male and female nipples get erect during arousal?
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.120]   - I believe so.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.120]   - I think so, yeah.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   You know, you maybe get the sex flush, right?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   You get some redness or warmth feeling.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   That's your body's response, right, to arousal,
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   and sometimes that can be an erection and sometimes that's not.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.120]   Not having an erection does not mean you're not aroused.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.120]   It may mean other things, but certainly that's part of it.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   And then desire, do you want to have sex?
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   Do you have, like when you think about your partner
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   or whoever you want to engage with,
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   is there a desire to actually do that, right?
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   Or is it just more of obligation or other things?
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.120]   And it doesn't matter if the desire comes after arousal.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   For some women in particular,
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.120]   we see that they may not have the desire right away,
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   but they want to be intimate or close with their partner,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   and so they'll start just being close with them
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   and then arousal will come, and then, "Oh, yeah, I like this."
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.120]   So then the desire comes after, and that's normal.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120]   That's totally fine.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.120]   So you want to kind of parse that out,
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   and then for men you can ask,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.120]   "Are you getting erections at night?"
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   Because that will tell us the function of your organ at night
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.120]   versus during the day where you have also psychogenic components, right?
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   You can really get in your head about erections.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   When you have a problem in the bedroom with performance,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   it becomes a vicious cycle, right?
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   So you have a problem.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   The next time you're really stressed, you're not present.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   You're not mindful in the moment with sex,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   and you're thinking about, "Oh, my God, am I going to perform okay?
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   Am I going to perform okay?"
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.120]   And then it doesn't perform again, and it's getting worse and worse,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   and the anxiety is through the roof,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.120]   and that's actually causing your sexual dysfunction.
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   So I think it's important first to identify those issues,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   and then also for blood flow, a lot of times we can assess based on,
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   well, what other comorbidities do you have?
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   Do you have other issues ongoing that may be affecting your blood flow?
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.120]   Most common, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and if you smoke.
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   All of those things will affect blood flow to the genitals,
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   and so that will point us...
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   -Negatively. -Negatively.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   So that will point us to a more vascular issue.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.120]   Hormonal issues are very important for desire,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.120]   and as far as sexual function in terms of erections,
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.120]   there's only 3% of erectile dysfunction that's related to hormones.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   -So it's actually more... -But that's pure erectile function...
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120]   -Correct. -...as opposed to desire.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   Desire is predominantly modulated by the hormone testosterone
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   for both men and women.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   In fact, a lot of people don't know this,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   but women have more testosterone in their bodies than they actually have estrogen.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   So testosterone is very important for both men and women for a variety of reasons.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   And so using that discussion with the patient
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.120]   will help you kind of identify where you're headed
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   in terms of what you need to focus on for treatment.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   There are certain things you can use to assess blood flow.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.120]   You can do Doppler ultrasounds of the penis as well as the clitoris
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.120]   to see if there is good blood flow.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   You can assess the peak systolic velocity,
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.120]   which will tell you if there's a problem with arterial inflow,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   versus the end diastolic velocity,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   which will tell you if there's a problem with venous outflow.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.120]   And so that can assess those things.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   There are some tests you can do for nerve function,
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   although they're very uncommonly done
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   because mostly we can kind of get that through a clinical report.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.120]   And unfortunately, if you're having nerve problems,
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.120]   sometimes it depends on what's causing them,
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   but sometimes they can be very difficult to reverse,
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   and that's kind of a problem.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   We know that as people age, their sensation becomes less.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   So just through aging, the nerves, the receptors become less sensitive,
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:46.120]   and so you will generally have less responsiveness
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   to the same sensations you did when you were younger.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   And so that kind of overlays all of this.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   So it's complex, but really, you know,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   a lot of it comes from the discussion you have with your patient,
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   or you know, you kind of really doing a deep dive in what's going on,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   like really thinking about each of those aspects,
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   and also what's going on in your relationship,
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   and what's going on in, you know, your life, stress, anxiety,
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   like how are those playing a role?
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.120]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.120]   through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   but oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   what would it be? I answer AG1.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   - Gosh, lots there to unpack,
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   and I'm glad you mentioned the relationship itself
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   because there are all sorts of things that can impact the arousal response.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   Novelty, not everyone's in a committed relationship.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   Whether or not people are engaging in a lot of masturbation
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   to the point of ejaculation or climax or not,
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   pornography, et cetera, we will get into that.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   It's a vast space to explore.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   Before we go any further, I want to make sure, however,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   that we cue people to where and how they could find
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.120]   a really good, let's say pelvic floor therapist
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   and where they could find a really great urologist
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.120]   to do the sorts of exams
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   and perhaps the sorts of treatments that we've talked about,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   because at least as far as I understand,
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   much of what people want to learn on this podcast
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   is how things work and what happens when things break down,
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   but also how to resolve those issues.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   So let's say somebody wants to check out their pelvic floor,
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   figure out what's going on there.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   Maybe they're having issues, maybe they're not.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   If they are male or female, where do they go?
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.120]   Is there a place online that has a great list
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.120]   of some of the best ones in one's area?
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.120]   Can it be done over telemedicine?
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   How does one go about that?
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   - Yeah, so in terms of your pelvic floor,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   it's good to get assessed by a physician
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   who specializes in pelvic floor.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   Now, that could be a urologist,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   that could be a gynecologist or even a physical medicine rehabilitation doctor
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   that specializes in pelvic floor health.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   So typically you'll see in urology,
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   you'll look for people who are board certified
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   If you're a woman, if you're a man, maybe sexual medicine,
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   someone who specializes in sexual medicine
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   would be a good place to look.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.120]   For a gynecologist, again, you want to look at someone
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   who has interest in this area, who does manage pelvic floor.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.120]   And then in terms of pelvic floor physical medicine rehabilitation,
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   at least when I was in training, there was about 20 PM&R doctors
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   around the country who really focused on this.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   So it's not a lot of people.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   If you can go to a pelvic floor physical therapist
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   and you have one near you, that's great as well.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   You do want to make sure that one,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   they do are certified in pelvic floor physical therapy
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   and that they have taken care of your gender.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   So if you have male anatomy,
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   then you want to go to someone who's actually seen men
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   because a lot of the pelvic floor physical therapists
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   tend to treat a lot of women.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.120]   And so that's kind of what I tell my patients,
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   generally speaking, there's no, at least to my knowledge,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   no great resource and maybe we'll look that up
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   and see if we can find one.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   - That's very helpful, thank you.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   Because again, going back to what I said
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   at the beginning of our conversation,
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   I think there's a lot of shame or at least a lack of clarity
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   as to how one gets help for issues
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   that relate to the genitals, right?
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   Because if you have a headache or you're having an eye issue,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.120]   I mean, you sort of know where to go.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.120]   Hopefully your headache
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   doesn't warrant going to a neurologist, but it might.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   Eye stuff tends to be ophthalmologist optometrists, right?
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   So I don't think we hear often enough
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   about where to access the best quality care for these things.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   So thank you for that.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   In thinking about sexual dysfunction,
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   I'd like to have that conversation
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   more or less in parallel if we can
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   around male sexual dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   And I want to make sure that before we do that,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   that I'm creating the correct parallel construction,
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   as they say.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.120]   Erectile dysfunction in males
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   is clearly a form of sexual dysfunction.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   What is the parallel to erectile dysfunction in females?
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   Is it lack of vaginal lubrication
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.120]   and lack of relaxation of the vagina
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   to have non-painful intercourse?
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   I mean, is it even possible
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   to have a parallel conversation about these two things?
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   - So it's different.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   In some circumstances, there are homologs, right?
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   So the penis is the homologue of the clitoris.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.120]   So the clitoris is essentially
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   the same sort of spongy erectile tissue
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   that you see in the penis.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   It gets erect with arousal
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   and it actually extends very deep into the pelvis,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   so it's not just a small little organ.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   It's actually quite long.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   And so you can, in men, you can have erectile dysfunction
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   'cause you can see it,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   but in women, you may have difficulty with orgasm.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   And it's not exactly a parallel,
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.120]   but difficulty orgasming in women is multifactorial
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   and we can get into that.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.120]   But I think they're different
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   and I think also sexual dysfunction
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   presents differently in both genders.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   So when you talk about men,
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   the one visual they see of arousal is erections.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.120]   And so it becomes very ingrained in your psyche
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   that if I don't have an erection, I'm not aroused, right?
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   But there's a lot of reasons
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   that you might not have an erection
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   that we've sort of touched on,
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   vascular problems, hormonal problems, neurologic problems,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   psychogenic issues, and other medications you're taking.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   So there are issues that can affect erectile function
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   and so that can be part of it
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   where you might feel like you have low desire
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   because your arousal's not there
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   and that becomes a little bit confusing.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   For women, what they can assess
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   is their level of lubrication if sex hurts
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   and if they get an orgasm.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   And so those are kind of the ways you can look at it.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   - Thank you for fleshing all of that out.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   Years ago, I worked on sexual differentiation
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.120]   and in particular the role of hormones
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   in sexual differentiation.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   And indeed, as you described,
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   we learned because we were taught
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   and I think people still generally agree
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   that if one looks at the embryological origins
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   of the penis and the clitoris,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   they are essentially analogous structures
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   and that a lot of male genital development
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   involves literally the regression,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   the disappearance of the female sexual genitalia
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   and associated organs,
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.120]   malaria and ducts and things like that,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   and what would become the ovaries,
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.120]   become the testes, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   Those are anatomical parallels,
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   but what you just described for us very beautifully
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   is the sort of functional parallels
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   as it relates to sexual function and dysfunction.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   So I'm hoping with that framing
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   that we can knock down a few of these pins
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   in a little less time
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   because there's a lot to tackle here.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   First off, I'd like to address the hormonal issues.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   You mentioned that only 3% of erectile dysfunction
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   and by extension, can we say also female issues
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   with sexual arousal are hormonal in origin.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   Is that right?
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   - So with desire, yes.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   They are hormonal in general
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   and arousal in terms of lubrication,
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   if you're using that as a barometer,
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   yes, you can see less vaginal lubrication due to hormones.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.120]   And I guess I would say three to 6% more,
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.120]   up to 6% we see of erectile dysfunction is hormonal.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   It's a small percentage
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   of the entirety of erectile dysfunction.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.120]   - Okay, so I think in looking in the landscape
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.120]   of social media and podcasts
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.120]   and just in the common mindset,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   we've all come to believe
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   that testosterone is pro libido.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   It's pro desire in men and women.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   I think now people are starting to appreciate
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.120]   that it's pro desire in women as well,
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.120]   but certainly in men.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   And that dopamine is also associated with desire.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   And the general public tends to have this view
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   of estrogen as being sort of anti libido
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   or anti male, which is frankly false.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   In fact, and I've covered this on the podcast
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   with Dr. Kyle Gillette and with Dr. Peter Attia
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   and another fellow YouTuber Derek
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   from More Plates More Dates has talked a lot
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   about the fact that if people,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   if men, excuse me, take drugs
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   like an astrozole to suppress their estrogen,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   thinking that, oh, it's all about having high testosterone,
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   low estrogen, oftentimes they crush their libido,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:51.120]   just abolish it, which has led to a slowly growing,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   but I think positive shift
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.120]   in how people are thinking about estrogen.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   Estrogen is great for brain function.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   Estrogen is great for libido in men and women.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   And that is a revision of,
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   I think how most people think of the male sexual response.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.120]   It's more in keeping with how people think
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   about the female sexual response.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   Oh, estrogen and the female sexual response.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.120]   That makes sense.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.120]   But what we're trying to do here
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.120]   is clarify some of the misconceptions.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   Now, the reason I mentioned dopamine
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   is that my understanding is that dopamine
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   is involved in the, excuse me, the desire response.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   We will distinguish desire, the psychological arousal
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   from genital arousal, physical arousal.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   And that prolactin is associated with the refractory period
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120]   during which erection can't occur.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   Another perhaps orgasm can't occur in females, et cetera.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   But my understanding is that's also not that simple.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.120]   And we need to take a step back perhaps
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   and just talk about the physiological underpinnings
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.120]   of the desire and arousal response.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.120]   So I'll tell you what I was taught
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   and then you can tell me where it's wrong.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   - Sure.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.120]   - I hope.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   I was taught that the erection response
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   and the vaginal lubrication response
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   is generated by the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   the relaxed, the rest and digest aspect of the nervous system
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.120]   hence why some people can get psychogenic sexual issues
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.120]   of lack of erection or lack of vaginal lubrication.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.120]   But that there are individuals out there
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.120]   for whom a lot of alertness maybe even,
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   and this is a controversial thing,
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.120]   but for some people even some sense of aggression
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   or kind of edginess or excitement,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.120]   adrenaline in other words,
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   can stimulate erection or vaginal lubrication.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.120]   So it gets tricky.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.120]   It's not like the textbooks,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.120]   it's not like they taught us in high school
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.120]   as far as I know.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.120]   I was taught that the arousal response
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   in males and females
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.120]   is initiated by a parasympathetic sort of relaxed tone.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:49.120]   And that as sexual desire and arousal
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.120]   and sex or masturbation progresses,
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.120]   that it shifts more towards the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.120]   which has nothing to do with emotional sympathy
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.120]   and has everything to do with arousal,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.120]   the catecholamines, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   also called adrenaline and noradrenaline are released.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.120]   And that the climax response,
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   which may or may not include ejaculation,
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   we have to separate that out,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:15.120]   is one that is really of the stress system of the body.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.120]   And then in the post-coital or post ejaculatory
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.120]   or post climax phase,
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   then there's a shift back
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   to the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.120]   That's where the pillow talk
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.120]   and the exchange of odors and tastes and other molecules
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120]   is known to enhance pair bonding
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.120]   through things like oxytocin, vasopressin, and so on.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.120]   And what I just described
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.120]   is exceedingly oversimplified, I realize,
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.120]   but is that more or less how the physiology works?
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.120]   - Yeah, so the way we're taught in medical school
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   is point and shoot.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.120]   So point is the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.120]   - All the male audience will like that one.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.120]   - And then you go on to the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   but it makes sense.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120]   And the reason that I think you're hearing
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   about this aggression
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.120]   or these things that are leading to arousal
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.120]   is because there needs to be a stimulus, right?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   A visual stimulus, a tactile stimulus,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   some sort of stimulus that you're getting
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.120]   that is then causing the release of nitric oxide
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   from the parasympathetic nervous system.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   And that could be for some people,
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   aggression or some form of that, right?
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   - Can you tell people about nitric oxide?
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   Because we'll get into this
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.120]   when we talk about drugs that increase blood flow,
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.120]   Cialis, Viagra, and also non-prescription drugs,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   things like L-citrulline, arginine,
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   and watermelon for that matter, right?
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   So I read on the internet.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.120]   - So yeah, so nitric oxide is essentially the ignition
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.120]   for what we say for erections, the ignition for erections.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.120]   The reason I talk about erections more often
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.120]   is when you look at the data,
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   in fact, there was a paper on this
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   where they looked at the number of articles
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.120]   that came up when you put in the word penis
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   and the number of articles
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   that came up when you put in the word clitoris,
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   and it was 50,000 about penis and 2000 about the clitoris.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.120]   - Okay, this was actually a major section of the comments
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:09.120]   on when I asked for questions on Instagram
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   and comments on comments and yeah,
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.120]   how come, why not, et cetera?
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.120]   Is that because the urology and sexual health field
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.120]   was dominated by men?
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   That's going to be the presumption.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:27.120]   Or is it because it's easier to study somehow?
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   I mean, what's going on here?
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   - Yeah, I think there's been a lot of,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   I mean, you can go back to like Freud
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   where he thought that the female sexual response
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.120]   was less valuable.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   And so there are some reasons-
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   - Less valuable?
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   - I guess, I don't know if that's the right term, but-
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   - Oh, no, no, I'm not challenging your term.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   I just meant-
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   - You know, it was sort of dismissed.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   - He seemed to be obsessed with it, right?
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   - But it was more about the male sexual response
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   than the female sexual response.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   And so in general, yes, there is, you know,
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   there were more men in medicine.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   There was more, and it is easier to study, right?
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   You can't say the clitoris quite as easy
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.120]   as you can study the male penis response
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   because you can see it visually.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.120]   You can inject it and see an erection response, right?
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.120]   We do this for people who have erectile dysfunction.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.120]   They'll take medications that increase blood flow,
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.120]   like Trimix, and you'll inject it into the penis
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.120]   and you'll see an erection.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:15.120]   So you can actually-
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120]   - Trimix?
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   - Trimix, so there's, it's-
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.120]   - The entire male audience just went,
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   "Wait, what are you injecting into the penis?"
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.120]   - So there are three basically brand names
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   of intracavranosal injections
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   that we use for erectile dysfunction.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   - I hear injection in penis, and I think I'd say,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   I like to think that it reflects a natural male response.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.120]   I sort of, taken aback.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.120]   I don't know, maybe there's a pelvic floor contraction
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   in there someplace.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   - So it is scary to hear about.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   It's a very small needle.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   It is very well tolerated.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   I've done it to patients in the office
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   and they look at me and say, "You're done?"
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   Like they don't even, you know,
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   it's not as painful as it seems.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:55.120]   And when you are not having erections
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   and you've tried multiple things,
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.120]   people get to the point where they're willing to try that.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   You know, and so it is very effective.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.120]   It is the most effective non-surgical treatment
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.120]   we have for erectile dysfunction.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:09.120]   And it's usually either one medication,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.120]   two medications or three.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.120]   So you can have, you know, alprostedil, papaverine,
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   and the third one.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   - That's a good, we can look at,
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.120]   someone will put it in the comments.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.120]   - Sure, sure.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120]   - Surely they will.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.120]   What is it designed to do?
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.120]   Is it a vasodilator of sorts?
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   - So they work in different mechanisms,
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   but similar to the medications that we have,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.120]   PDE-5 inhibitors.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.120]   PDE-5 inhibitors work in the erection cascade.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.120]   Basically what happens, let's actually,
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   let's take it back to the nitric oxide thing
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.120]   and we'll get there.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   So nitric oxide essentially is released
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.120]   by the endothelium in response
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   to a visual tactile stimulating cue, right?
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   And so your body releases nitric oxide,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.120]   which then sets off the cascade for the erection.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.120]   And so that releases CGMP,
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   which causes the erection
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   and it's degraded by phosphodiesterase.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.120]   And so medications that inhibit phosphodiesterase,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.120]   like Viagra and Cialis,
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.120]   tend to prevent the breakdown of that CGMP
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.120]   so you have longer lasting erections.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   And so similarly,
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.120]   these medications work sort of similar to that.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   Some of them, we don't know exactly how they work,
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   but they work by increasing CGMP or CAMP
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.120]   that are involved in those cascades.
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.120]   - And what about L-citrulline?
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.120]   I hear about L-citrulline use.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   It's an over-the-counter supplement
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   and it's in the arginine pathway.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   And my understanding is that it works similarly
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.120]   to things like Cialis, Viagra,
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.120]   but is perhaps not as potent.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.120]   I also just, a cautionary note out there,
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   L-citrulline can give people vicious cold sores
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   and canker sores, vicious.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   You hear about this on the internet.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.120]   It's been verified by grotesque images
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.120]   that you do not want to Google for
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   and not everyone tolerates it well.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   - So these actually work by increasing nitric oxide.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   So they're not later down the pathway.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   They're actually increasing the availability
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   of nitric oxide.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   So L-arginine is the more direct pathway,
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   but it's very low bioavailability.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   L-citrulline converts to L-arginine,
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   but it lasts much longer in the bloodstream,
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   which is why people tend to use L-citrulline.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Now, in sexual medicine, these supplements,
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   while there's been some studies on them
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   and they are effective,
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   there's no regulation on the supplement industry.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   So we can recommend them,
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   but we just can't say that for sure
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   that the supplement is exactly what's said on the bottle.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   We see lots of studies where they'll say,
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   I read one about melatonin
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.120]   and there's a variation of melatonin
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   from like what's on the bottle to 400% times more.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   And so that's kind of the struggle
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   that we as medical doctors have.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   And I know we get a lot of slack for it
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   that we don't talk about supplements,
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   but it's really the challenge there
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   is like finding the quality supplement.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   - A great site is, which I have no relationship to,
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   except that I mention them all the time,
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   is examine.com, which has references to human studies
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   and where there's a lot of efficacy shown.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   And we'll get into some side effect issues.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   Can't address quality by brand issues,
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   but thanks for mentioning that.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   What percentage of males who take Cialis,
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:18.120]   AKA to dalafil, or Viagra for erectile dysfunction
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   get relief from that?
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   Because you mentioned only 3% of erectile issues in males
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.120]   are hormonal in origin,
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   but what percentage are likely to be blood flow
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.120]   related in origin?
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.120]   - So a large percentage are blood flow related.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   That doesn't mean that the medication
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.120]   will be effective for everyone.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   If you look at the large percentage
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   are vascular in nature, right?
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.120]   That's the number one cause as men age.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   So we know that about 52% of men over the age of 40
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   will have erectile dysfunction,
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   and that continues to increase as you age.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   So 50% of 50 year olds, 60% of 60 year olds,
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.120]   and so on and so forth.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   So it's very, very common.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   And the success rate in the studies is about 60 to 70%.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.120]   So when you give someone a medication,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   they will have sustained erections
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   that are sufficient for penetrative intercourse,
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   which is the way we kind of discuss
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   erectile dysfunction in studies
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   and with patients is about 60 to 70%.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.120]   So not everyone will have success,
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   but not all of that is because the medication doesn't work.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   Sometimes people are not taking them correctly.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   Sometimes people need to try different doses.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   And then there's still this issue of,
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   you know, your brain is still active.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.120]   And so if you're having anxiety
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.120]   or having other issues or stress in your life,
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   that can have an effect on your ability
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   to create an erection.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.120]   So there's lots of factors that go into it.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   But generally speaking, they are effective
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.120]   and they do work quite well and they're tolerated pretty well.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   And 60 to 70% is not a small number.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   That's a significant number.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   That's the majority, but by a significant margin.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.120]   Is there a basis for the use of Cialis to Dallafil, Viagra,
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:02.120]   L-citrulline in females?
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   - So yeah, there's not a lot of data on this,
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.120]   but certainly, you know,
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   if you have surmised that there is a blood flow issue
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:12.120]   and they're having difficulties with orgasm,
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   it's certainly something you can try off label.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   And certainly people do try these medications off label
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   to see if they improve sexual function for women,
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   but there's not a whole bunch of robust, you know,
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.120]   randomized controlled trial studies on women
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   with these medications.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   - A little bit later,
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.120]   we will talk about prostate health specifically,
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   but I'm just going to make a note here
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   that nowadays there's increasing use
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   of low dosage Cialis/Todalafil.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   So rather than what I found online
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   was that the erectile dysfunction treatment dosage
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   of Cialis/Todalafil is somewhere
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   in the 15 to 20 milligram range.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   What we're talking about here is daily use
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   of 2.5 to 5 milligrams of Cialis/Todalafil
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   for prostate health.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   And I learned in researching for this episode
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   that Todalafil Cialis was actually developed
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   as a drug for the treatment of prostate health
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:15.120]   to essentially increase blood flow of the prostate
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   to increase prostate health,
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   not for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.120]   So I found that to be somewhat interesting.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.120]   And a lot of people are now starting to use that.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   I also learned that if you dive
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   into the guts of the internet,
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   one can find that now there's a growing use
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   of combined low dosage Cialis and Apomorphine,
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   which is a pro dopaminergic agent.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.120]   And we'll get back to dopamine a little bit later,
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:43.120]   but is there any basis for low dosage,
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   say 2.5 to 5 milligram daily use
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   of Cialis/Todalafil in females?
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   - Yes, so, well, let's talk about it for males and females.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.120]   I think low dose daily Cialis is excellent
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:57.120]   for erectile function in men.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   - Is that true even, sorry to interrupt,
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   but is that true even for men
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   that are not experiencing erectile dysfunction?
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   - It's not indicated for that purpose,
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   but there's a thought that, you know,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   it's increasing blood flow to the area.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   So people, I've personally used it for men
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   who have pelvic pain to help with increasing blood flow.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   You can also use it potentially as a preventative.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   So some people have, you know, kind of thought,
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   okay, it's increasing blood flow,
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   it's preventing fibrosis of that erectile tissue
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   that can happen with age or other vascular problems.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:28.120]   So it may be beneficial for that as well.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.120]   Although, again, that's off label
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.120]   and not something that we generally promote.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.120]   As far as for women, there's, you know, again,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.120]   it can help with blood flow.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120]   So if you're having issues,
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.120]   so if you have a female who's having sexual dysfunction
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.120]   and she's got signs of vascular problems,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   like she's got diabetes, high blood pressure, she smokes,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   then yes, it's certainly reasonable to try
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   and see how they do.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:52.120]   Usually you want to give at least a four-week trial
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.120]   to see if there's any benefit with those medications.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.120]   - Great, thank you for that.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   Why is it that I get so many questions
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   about erectile dysfunction
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   from males who are in their 20s and 30s?
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   Because everything you said up until now
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   was mainly focused on men 40 years and older.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   Is it from lack of physical activity, overuse of nicotine,
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.120]   by the way, vaping as far as we know,
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.120]   vaping and smoking bad for erectile function
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   and perhaps sexual health in males and females generally
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   because nicotine is a vasoconstrictor.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.120]   Nicotine does have certain benefits,
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:29.120]   and I covered this in an episode on nicotine,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.120]   neurocognitive benefits in the elderly in particular,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   but it is a vasoconstrictor.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   So it runs against all of the sexual arousal stuff
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.120]   that we're talking about.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   But okay, let's assume that a male in their 20s or 30s
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:49.120]   is sleeping enough, you know, six to eight hours a night,
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.120]   is exercising, isn't doing anything
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.120]   to punish their pelvic floor in the gym.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.120]   You know, they're not doing legs cross kegels
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.120]   while doing crunches or something
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.120]   while inhaling on the crunch.
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   [laughing]
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.120]   That was a quiz by the way, folks,
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.120]   for earlier topics covered.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   Let's assume they're, you know, eating pretty well.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   Majority of their foods are coming from non-processed
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   or minimally processed foods.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.120]   They're doing a little meditation each day.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   They're engaging in hopefully healthy relationships.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   They're not masturbating like crazy to porn.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   And, you know, let's assume that they are, you know,
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.120]   not on any SSRI.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.120]   Why are all these 20 and 30 year olds
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.120]   on the internet asking mainly you?
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   'Cause they mainly run to you.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   But also to my direct messages about their erectile issues.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   - So I will say, I have seen a lot of young men in my clinic
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   and I will say that they very often
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.120]   have pelvic floor dysfunction.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   So that even though they're doing all the right things,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.120]   they do have, I mean, we're in a stressful society
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.120]   so you can try all the things to decrease your stress,
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.120]   but a lot of us are sitting long periods of time,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   especially during COVID.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   I mean, people sat for months, right?
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.120]   Years, like just sitting at their home computer.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.120]   And so, you know, exercising one hour
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   is not gonna offset the day full of sitting.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   And so all of those things can affect pelvic floor function.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.120]   So my theory is that that's probably the more common cause.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.120]   - So walk more.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120]   - Yeah.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   - I've actually heard that.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120]   - Or use a standing desk.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.120]   - Yep, yeah, walk more standing desk.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.120]   Okay, so, and then my guess
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:30.120]   is that there's some psychogenic feedback loop.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   - There's just nerd speak for things aren't working
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   as well as they would like, then they're stressing about it
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120]   and the stress is making things worse.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120]   - Absolutely, and you know, you mentioned
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.120]   that people are not masturbating or using porn,
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.120]   but a lot of people learn about sex through porn.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   Whether it's good or bad, we can't, you know,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.120]   it's not a great thing, but like that's accessible now.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120]   When we were growing up, you had to find a VCR,
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   you had to find a quiet room that no one was gonna walk in.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.120]   - I'm old enough to remember when the kid down the street,
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   I won't mention him, by last name,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   but yeah, the kid down the street, you know,
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120]   had porno magazines.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   - Yeah, or magazines.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.120]   - And then there was actually a library of these,
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.120]   goodness, I shouldn't say where they were,
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120]   in the town I grew up in where kids would stash them
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.120]   in specific locations in parking lots.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   And then, you know, boys would bike or skateboard over
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.120]   or walk over and then they would like take turns,
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   take turns, excuse me, looking at them.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   But that actually is to raise
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120]   perhaps a more important point,
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   which is that looking at pornography
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   is different than masturbating to pornography,
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   which is also different than masturbating to pornography
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.120]   to the point of ejaculation, right?
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.120]   Because I also get a lot of questions
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   from people about their porn addiction issues.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   And there's a growing theory out there that overuse
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   that meaning, not just looking at,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.120]   but masturbating to pornography to the point of ejaculation
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   is creating a deficit of seeking out
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   and cultivating healthy, real world sexual interactions.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   - Yeah, so I want to start this before I get into that
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   is to say that if you're masturbating to porn
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   and you have normal, healthy relationships
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.120]   and you're going to work and you have a great partner
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   and everything's great in your life, it's okay.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   Like shame is a real problem.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.120]   - And maybe they're watching pornography together.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   - Yeah, so I think it's important though
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   that at least in the literature,
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   they don't describe porn addiction.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.120]   They call it problematic pornography use.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.120]   And it's only described in about 4% of people
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.120]   in these studies.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   So it's a small subset of people.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   I think it's becoming more common
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.120]   because pornography is so accessible
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.120]   and it activates the dopamine pathways
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   just like any other sort of addiction, right?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   You watch pornography, you get a dopamine response.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.120]   Your brain then says, "Oh, I want that again."
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.120]   And you keep seeking more novel, more aggressive,
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.120]   different types of pornography to get that same response,
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.120]   but it doesn't happen to everybody.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.120]   - But also I would say, sorry to interrupt,
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   but that the dopamine response
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   as a hardwired biological mechanism
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   for adaptive behaviors, including,
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   and let's just define healthy sexual behavior
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   because I feel like there's such a range on that
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:22.120]   depending on one's background, religious beliefs, et cetera.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120]   Anytime we talk about sex on this podcast,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   I like to say that involves at least four things,
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.120]   obviously consensual, age appropriate,
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   context appropriate, species appropriate.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120]   - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.120]   I'm really glad you brought that up.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120]   So I've heard you say that before,
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   but it's very important.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.120]   And so I think there is a spectrum,
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   a large spectrum of people who watch pornography,
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.120]   ejaculate to pornography and have a normal life.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.120]   And so that's fine.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   I think that if we shame those people,
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120]   we're creating problems, right?
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   We say like, "Oh, you do that, that's horrible."
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.120]   And then they're in their head, right?
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   And then they're causing problems in their life
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   because of shame.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   And so I think there's a little bit of cultural shame
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   that comes of this discussion.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.120]   And so it's a problem in the longterm
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.120]   if we say that, "Oh, this is gonna create problems,"
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   'cause not everyone has.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   There's so many people who watch pornography
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   and have no problems, who have normal healthy relationships,
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.120]   great sex with their partner, and it's fine.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.120]   - Or they're between relationships.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.120]   - Yeah.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   - And they're relying on masturbation specifically.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120]   - Right.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120]   - Are there any data that distinguish
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   between just pure imagination fantasy
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   versus visual fantasy as it relates to developing
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   or inhibiting sexual health?
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   And here we're talking about the desire aspect.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   Let's assume physical arousal is handled.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120]   - No pun intended.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   - So I think that the thing about young people,
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   I wanna get back to that, then I'll answer your question.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   But the thing about young people who are watching pornography,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   that's what they think sex is supposed to be like.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   They don't get an education about what sex is, right?
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   No one has a conversation with their kids like,
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.120]   "Hey guys, this is what happens when you have sex.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120]   "This is how long it should take.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   "This is what foreplay is.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.120]   "And this is like not normal.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.120]   "This is a production.
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   "This is a produced product that's meant to arouse you, right?
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.120]   "And to give you ideally an ejaculation or an orgasm, right?"
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.120]   So no one has that discussion.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.120]   So then go to relationships like,
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.120]   "Why did my partner not react like that woman did
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.120]   "on the porno, right?
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.120]   "Or why did I not react like that woman did
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.120]   "on the porno, right?"
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   - Or why didn't he react when, you know,
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.120]   like they would in porn?
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   Because again, I think females are watching porn as well.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.120]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   - So I think that you raise a really critical point,
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   which is that the shame can extend both ways.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.120]   - And so I think to that end, that's a problem.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   And because it's so accessible,
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   I think we need to have conversations.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120]   I think it needs to be open.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.120]   We have to talk about sex.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.120]   And that's kind of why I do what I do.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.120]   We have to have these conversations
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.120]   so people know what normal is.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.120]   - Thank you for that.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.120]   I do think that people need to know what normal is
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.120]   and what the range on normal is.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Keeping the constraints that we talked about place earlier,
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.120]   because I do think those are universal healthy constraints.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   Consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate,
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   species appropriate.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.120]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120]   to help you better understand your body
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   and help you meet your health goals.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.120]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.120]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.120]   However, with a lot of blood tests out there,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   you get information back about blood lipids,
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   about hormones and so on,
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.120]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.120]   With InsideTracker, they have a personalized platform
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.120]   that makes it very easy to understand your data,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   that is to understand what those lipids,
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.120]   what those hormone levels, et cetera mean,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.120]   and behavioral supplement nutrition and other protocols
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.120]   to adjust those numbers to bring them into the ranges
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.120]   that are ideal for your immediate and long-term health.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.120]   InsideTracker's ultimate plan now includes measures
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.120]   of both ApoB and of insulin,
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.120]   which are key indicators of cardiovascular health
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   and energy regulation.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.120]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.120]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   I asked whether or not imagined
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   the pure imagination-based arousal versus visual arousal.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   And for some people, the sounds of people having sex
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   is extremely arousing.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.120]   If you've ever lived in a major city like New York,
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   which I've spent summers in New York,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   you hear more often than you do in areas
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   where people are living further apart,
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   you hear people having sex.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.120]   It's part of the auditory landscape.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120]   - Yep, you're very close together.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.120]   But yeah, so there's not exactly,
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.120]   at least to my knowledge,
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.120]   I don't know of the data that looks at fantasy
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   versus visual versus auditory,
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   but I will say that you can get habituated
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   to certain things.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   And there is that data that maybe you can get habituated
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   to watching a certain type of thing to get aroused
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.120]   and then normal things do not get you aroused, right?
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   Like you may watch pornography
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   and then you may have difficulty getting aroused
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.120]   or turned on when you see your partner.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.120]   You may get used to masturbating a certain way, right?
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.120]   So if you use certain vibratory stimulation
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   or certain pressure sensation every single time
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   you masturbate, you can get habituated to that
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120]   and you may not be able to replicate that
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.120]   during penetrative intercourse.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   And so I think that's really important
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.120]   and I think the take home is to try
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120]   and vary what you're doing.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.120]   Masturbation is find healthy way of self exploration.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   Again, with the caveat that as long as you're not
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   masturbating to excess and avoiding your obligations
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   or your family or your partners or your friends, right?
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   Like you are just masturbating for the benefits
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   of maybe sleep improvement, mood boosting,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   reduction in anxiety, those things are great.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   And so I think with that being said,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   you just want to be thoughtful about varying it up.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120]   - One of the issues with masturbation
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   that I've talked about when I was a guest on other podcasts,
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.120]   mainly in the context of male masturbation
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   and perhaps with pornography, perhaps not,
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   is that it's pretty clear based on the data
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   surrounding addiction that anytime there are big increases
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.320]   in dopamine without a lot of effort required
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.780]   to generate that dopamine, like turning on pornography
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.680]   on the internet versus asking someone out on a date,
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.120]   going out on a date.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.640]   Again, we're talking about going through the conversations
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.200]   and the mating ritual that is the human mating ritual
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.920]   that of course in the context of healthy interactions
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.100]   involves getting mutual consent
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.800]   and these kinds of things, right?
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.160]   That you could imagine how,
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.000]   without placing any moral judgment on it,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   without shaming anybody, you could imagine
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.680]   that if somebody exclusively masturbated
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.160]   and didn't develop the skills of courtship
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.580]   and building healthy sexual relationships,
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.240]   that pornography and or masturbation
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.280]   could start to create quote unquote problems, right?
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.680]   Whereby somebody only felt comfortable in those domains.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.420]   And I think that's what I'm hearing more and more about
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.200]   when it seems to be young men reach out.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.240]   - Absolutely and I think you're,
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.500]   it's definitely the ease of access, right?
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.240]   But I think that's pervasive in the young society now.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.040]   You don't have to actually go and find a mate.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.440]   You can just go on an app and look for somebody, right?
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.800]   Like there's many- - Well, that's a form
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.640]   of finding a mate.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.520]   I mean, I was weaned in the era
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.000]   when no smartphones or anything and-
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.760]   - No, my point is I think that we've become
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.300]   very connected to technology in our world,
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.080]   which also means that we're having less conversations.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.600]   The younger generation is having less conversations
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.520]   and more online conversations.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.440]   And I think that's a skill
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.760]   that needs to be developed as well.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.620]   And I think part of that is contributing
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.000]   to all this as well.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.820]   - Well, one thing that I can attest to is that,
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.200]   I grew up in a community of mostly male friends.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.460]   I have, female friends always have,
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:14.100]   where a lot of what we learned about sex
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.800]   came from older, in my case, guys.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.320]   My sister probably learned a lot about sex
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.720]   from her female friends.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:25.540]   And there was always that one guy who would just say stuff
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:29.200]   that years later I realized was incredibly misleading, right?
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.400]   Maybe even just detrimental.
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.240]   And I just want to remind people that when you are on Reddit
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.400]   or anywhere on the internet
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.120]   and there's people saying things with certainty,
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.400]   they might be that guy, right?
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.400]   And if I look at the long arc of those people's,
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.640]   that guy's life, it didn't speak to tremendous success
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.780]   in the domain for which they were asserting such confidence.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.060]   Let me put it that way.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.260]   Okay, I'd like to slightly pivot
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.660]   to a different aspect of this conversation
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.180]   because it's just really critical,
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.820]   which is the female sexual response.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.240]   This is something that does not get enough discussion.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.420]   - And there's a lot of stereotypes, right?
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:20.240]   The stereotype that we hear about is,
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.720]   oh, they need more foreplay, which can be true.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.880]   Some cases is not true.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.680]   The stereotype is that women are more intimacy
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.880]   and relationship based in their sexual response.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.760]   That can be true.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.080]   I have female friends and have known women
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.160]   who also are just really interested
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.340]   in having sex for sex sake at times, or maybe all the time.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.880]   I like to think that we are past the stage
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.160]   of human development where the stereotypes
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.360]   around this are fixed, right?
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.400]   And we hear more about this and we see more about this now,
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.000]   but what is the real deal
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.200]   around the female arousal response?
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.620]   And then we will talk about female orgasm response.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:12.240]   And there, I'm just going to earmark now
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.040]   that anytime we say something like arousal or orgasm,
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.660]   there are multiple forms of that, right?
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.240]   And we will talk about the multiple forms of female orgasm.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.700]   - Yeah, so if you talk about the response cycle,
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.240]   you can go back to the research of Masters and Johnson.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.160]   And so what they did, this was way back when,
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.480]   and they actually watched sex workers have sex.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.240]   And this was, I guess, okay back then.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.340]   - Female sex workers.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.360]   - Yeah, with men, yeah.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.840]   So they watched and they took note
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.320]   of the steps of the female arousal or sexual response.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.400]   And so the first phase is excitement, right?
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.460]   And during that phase, your heart rate goes up,
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.560]   you're breathing a little heavier, there's the sex flush.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.800]   You can see redness in areas like in the vulva,
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.040]   in the breast, I mean, in the nipples.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.480]   And then you go to sort of,
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.920]   and that can last a variety of different times.
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.240]   You'll also start seeing some lubrication vaginally, right?
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.800]   And then the plateau response is when, you know,
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.760]   that is kind of at its peak and it kind of stays steady.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.360]   And then you reach orgasm.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.520]   And so orgasm essentially is a response of the body
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.560]   where you will have, again, increased sympathetic response,
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.320]   and you will have pelvic floor muscle contractions,
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.240]   which are rhythmic, about 0.8 seconds or so,
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:30.080]   you're having a rhythmic pelvic floor contraction,
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.540]   along with the sensation of orgasm.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.500]   And then you'll have your recovery period,
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.960]   which you talked about briefly earlier,
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.380]   which can have, you know, sort of a refractory time period,
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:42.560]   at which point you can no longer, you know, orgasm again,
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.960]   if you'd like to, or for men to obtain another erection,
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.440]   again, for a short period of time.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.840]   And that can be kind of an absolute refractory period,
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.560]   so where it's definitely not happening,
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.320]   and then a relative refractory period
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.880]   where you'd need something more novel and exciting
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.360]   to then, again, resume that cycle again.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.180]   - The Coolidge Effect. - Yeah.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.400]   - I've talked about the Coolidge Effect
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.300]   before on this podcast.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.880]   I'll just cue people to a timestamp link
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.960]   in the show note caption so we don't go down the path.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.880]   But one thing that's really important to understand
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.400]   is that the Coolidge Effect is present
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.920]   in both males and females,
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.920]   meaning if a male ejaculates and is of the feeling
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.320]   that they can't have another erection
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.280]   for some period of time,
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.680]   the presentation of a novel,
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.840]   I guess we should say partner,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.680]   because we could be talking
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.040]   about homosexual relationship here, not just heterosexual,
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.780]   but a novel sexual partner, female or male,
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.600]   depending on their proclivities,
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.760]   can override the refractory period,
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.160]   and they can have another erection and ejaculation.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.360]   Similarly, a female will have
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.380]   a post-orgasmic refractory period.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.240]   If they're given an adequate stimulus, right,
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.140]   something arousing enough,
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.280]   they can experience arousal and orgasm again.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.400]   And we know, based on really good pharmacology,
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.700]   that this is a dopamine-driven thing,
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:01.680]   the prolactin is essentially establishing
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.520]   the refractory period,
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.960]   and the dopamine is essentially overriding
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.940]   the refractory period.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.240]   Fascinating neurochemistry there,
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.560]   and speaks to the incredible extent
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.000]   to which the brain is controlling the genitals.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.320]   - Yeah, I mean, we always say in sexual medicine
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.520]   that the brain is the most powerful organ for sex.
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.360]   Not your genitals, but the brain,
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.040]   because it is so powerful.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.440]   And I'm not sure if we're going to touch on this later,
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.320]   but I'll bring it up now.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.080]   There are some centrally acting medications now available
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.540]   for, they're FDA-approved for premenopausal women
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:32.540]   with low libido.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.860]   - Oh, well, maybe just throw those out,
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.680]   because the one that I'm aware of is in,
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.700]   that's often used in, let's say niche cultures,
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.300]   is melanocyte-stimulating hormone in men,
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:46.100]   which gives people a tan, makes them erect.
[01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.100]   The melanocyte-stimulating hormone at MSH
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:51.980]   comes from the medial pituitary, if I'm not mistaken,
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.680]   one of those weird regions.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.200]   No, everyone talks about anterior posterior,
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.000]   but, and people are now injecting this
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.960]   as a peptide, it can cause priapism.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.080]   I have not had that experience.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.160]   I've never tried this MSH,
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.840]   but I've been told that people are getting cavalier with it.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.480]   They can have issues.
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.160]   Priapism being enduring and perhaps even final erection.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.000]   Is that true?
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.280]   - So a priapism, a priapism, I mean,
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.660]   it's actually from Priapis, the Greek god
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.200]   who's often photographed with a really big erection.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:24.240]   - Oh, wow, we didn't hear enough
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.240]   about that Greek god in school.
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.560]   - But, or is it Roman, Roman or Greek?
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.280]   But anyway, so-- - Either way.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.560]   - It's an erection that lasts longer than four hours,
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.500]   and it is actually a surgical, or it's not a surgical,
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.860]   but it's actually an emergency.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.360]   If you have an erection that lasts longer than four hours
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.140]   in the absence of, you know, sexual arousal,
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.780]   then it is important to get to an emergency room
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.220]   because at that point, you can start developing
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.520]   decreased blood flow and ultimately changes
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.920]   to the actual tissues, scarring, fibrosis.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.240]   So it's really important to actually go
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.720]   to the emergency room, don't wait 'cause you're embarrassed.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.240]   Really get there and get treated.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.520]   - However, if I'm not mistaken, earlier you mentioned
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.720]   that it is exceedingly rare that people who take Cialis
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.940]   slash Tadalafil or Viagra for erections
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.140]   are getting true priapism.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.680]   - Correct, and it's mostly from those injectables
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.340]   we talked about earlier, those intracavranosal injections.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.480]   People can get priapism from those
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.720]   a little bit more commonly,
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.360]   and so that's something we always counsel on.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:25.860]   And also certain medications like Trazadone
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:27.680]   or if you have sickle cell anemia,
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.320]   those are the most common reasons
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.480]   that we see people coming in with priapism.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:32.320]   - Trazadone, really.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.760]   Okay, I'm gonna refrain from my desire to figure out that one
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.740]   so I don't take us down a rabbit hole here.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.800]   - Sorry, I wanted to get back to the MSH.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.000]   There is actually an FDA approved medication
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.440]   called bremelanotide is the brand name.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.240]   Vilecy is the, sorry, bremelanotide is the generic name.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:51.320]   Vilecy is the brand name, which is FDA approved
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.640]   for women with low desire,
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.860]   hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premenopausal women,
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.120]   premenopausal because that's what they studied,
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.740]   but it is basically the same peptide, right?
[01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:05.880]   So it is a melanocortin receptor agonist,
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.800]   and it works on the brain pathways to increase desire.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.220]   It's taken as an injectable, again, just like you said,
[01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.540]   about an hour, 45 minutes before when you want to want,
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.280]   you take it 45 minutes before,
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.600]   and it works quite effectively in increasing desire.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.920]   - How long does it last?
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.840]   - About 24 hours, some people maybe up to 48.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.060]   - Has it been, I mean, I know of men
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.080]   using melanocyte stimulating hormone peptides.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.480]   I also really want to caution people
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.240]   about obtaining gray market peptides.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.040]   Sorry for this insertion here,
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.380]   but there are a lot of peptides available
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.880]   without a prescription on the internet.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.440]   They are almost all contaminated
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.760]   with something called LPS, lipopolysaccharide,
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.600]   which is not something
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.240]   you want to be injecting a lot over time.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.880]   That's actually how we induce an immune response
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.800]   in animals in the laboratory,
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.280]   and it is amazing to me how many websites
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.720]   are selling this stuff, and it arrives to you easily.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.680]   You just buy it on the internet.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.520]   It says not for human or animal use,
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:05.920]   some people are injecting it,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.040]   and the LPS issue is something that I think
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.480]   is potentially going to shut down that whole market
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.920]   at some point, but if you're interested in using a peptide,
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.460]   you should be obtaining it by a prescription
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.320]   from a quality physician.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.760]   - Exactly, and because we have bremelanotide,
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.180]   we can prescribe that for men as well.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:23.680]   So sometimes we'll do it off-label
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:25.960]   for men who are having delayed ejaculation
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.040]   'cause it will help them achieve orgasm
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.760]   a little bit better.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.060]   And so this is available for premenopausal women.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.640]   The other medication that's available for low libido
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:39.900]   is called Flibanserin, also known as Addy is the brand name,
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:42.240]   and that also works on serotonergic,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.840]   it's got kind of a mixed response,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.040]   serotonin and dopaminergic areas of the brain,
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.000]   and essentially works as a daily medication
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.480]   taken before bedtime, 100 milligrams a day,
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.880]   that actually helps with decreasing
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.680]   hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.000]   Works in about 45 to 60% of patients,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.760]   and you need to take it for some time.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.280]   Now, both of these are brand name medications,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.000]   so they are a little bit costly,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.840]   and sometimes insurance doesn't cover them,
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.000]   but they are available,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.080]   and I think very few people know about them,
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.160]   and I think they're really great
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.880]   and useful tools in the toolbox.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.520]   - And these are for desire.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.280]   - They're for, yes, they're FDA approved
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.840]   for what we call hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.520]   which is essentially low libido
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.040]   that causes distress and bother.
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:26.560]   - I don't want to take us off course
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.360]   about vaginal lubrication, arousal, and female orgasm,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.760]   but as long as we're talking about arousal
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.760]   and reduced arousal that requires treatment,
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.540]   I have to ask this now.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:45.900]   Anytime we talk about arousal and libido, there's no BMI,
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.100]   which by the way, the body mass index
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:52.200]   is probably not the best tool either, but there's no chart.
[01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.640]   It's not like a thermometer that says you're 98.6
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.120]   plus or minus two degrees, you're good.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.160]   If it's too high, much higher than that, you have a fever.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.400]   If much lower than that, you're hypothermic.
[01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.000]   So my understanding, I don't want to say naive understanding,
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   but my understanding is that one determines
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:16.040]   whether or not their libido is normal, high, or low,
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.040]   largely based on some intuitive understanding
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.060]   of what their partner or partner's desire,
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:25.260]   whether or not they can meet those desires.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:29.460]   And if they sort of accrue enough of a sample size,
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.580]   they date enough people where they have sexual interactions,
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.620]   they figure out over time whether or not
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:37.160]   they have a low, medium, or high sex drive.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.580]   And people tend to compare to how they felt
[01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.760]   in earlier years or at different times of the year
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.340]   or under different psychological conditions
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.160]   and stress conditions, that kind of thing.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.180]   But we really don't have a benchmark for this, right?
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.480]   I mean, we can't say that, for instance,
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:54.480]   that if people are not desiring sex or thinking about sex
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.620]   with blank frequency, that they have low libido, right?
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:02.100]   It's sort of what is working or not working for you
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:04.060]   in the context of your life, right?
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.180]   Is that a reasonable way to think about it?
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:07.540]   - There's no right or wrong.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:08.400]   Basically what you're saying,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.380]   there's no right or wrong amount of libido.
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.080]   There's many people who identify as asexual
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.720]   and they are happy with that.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.780]   There are people who like to have sex once a month
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:18.860]   and they're happy with that.
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.220]   It really is a matter of distress.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.680]   Are you bothered by it?
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.300]   So when we look at studies for female sexual dysfunction,
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.360]   you can, using validated questionnaires like the FSFI,
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.300]   you can actually see that about 40% of people qualify
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.420]   for having sexual dysfunction,
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:38.720]   but really bother is only seen at about 12%.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.740]   And you can be bothered because you're bothered,
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.660]   you can be bothered 'cause your partner is bothered,
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:45.200]   but it's really up to you, right?
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.400]   Like if you feel like there's something
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.740]   that you wanna improve on,
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.520]   then that's when you go see your doctor.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.340]   But there's no right or wrong answer, right?
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.380]   This is very subjective and a lot of times we'll see couples
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:56.800]   who have mismatched libidos.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.220]   Now, does that mean one person's right
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.360]   and one person is wrong?
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.660]   No, it's just a matter of like, well, how do you,
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:04.760]   if you wanna come to a point where you agree,
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.160]   how do we get there, you know?
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.100]   And what is your end goal?
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.620]   - Yeah, later we'll talk a little bit more about chemistry,
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.220]   which I find infinitely fascinating
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:13.740]   because in my life experience,
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.380]   I've just been struck by the fact that occasionally
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.740]   you have a physical interaction with someone
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.820]   or sometimes it's not even physical interaction
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.640]   and they are just so unbelievably arousing to you
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.860]   or somewhere in between or sometimes
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.260]   it just sort of ain't there
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.580]   or it's just not there that much
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.560]   or nobody likes to talk about this
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.060]   or it's there until you sleep together
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:37.420]   and then it's not there.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:41.120]   And this is not just put on males, this is put on females.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.580]   I hope she doesn't kill me for saying this.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:48.700]   I know somebody who is a family member who once said,
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.500]   sometimes you have to realize you never wanna sleep
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.560]   with somebody again by sleeping with them.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.940]   And here we're not talking about traumatic experience, right?
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.260]   So, you know, again, the discussion around libido,
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:00.940]   as you so aptly pointed out,
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:02.940]   engaging what is healthy levels of libido
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.720]   has a lot to do with what one's self desires
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.280]   as well as the hopes and expectations
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.420]   of the people that we are sexually involved with.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.760]   So we'll get back to that a little bit later
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.720]   in the context of chemistry
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.160]   'cause I find it so fascinating
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.800]   and it's something that isn't talked about enough.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.900]   But thank you for that.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:23.140]   Let's get back to female sexual arousal response and orgasm.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:26.480]   - So physiologically, what happens to the body
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.980]   is it prepares for penetration.
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:31.240]   Now that could be a penis, that could be a sex toy,
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.080]   that could be a digit finger, to be more specific.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.520]   So what it does is the cervix moves up and out of the way,
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.840]   the inner 1/3, 2/3 of the vagina lengthens and elongates
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.440]   to allow for penetration.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.680]   And it can actually nearly double in size
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.120]   of the baseline vaginal length.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.060]   And so it is preparing for that.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.360]   So if you, and so that's part of it.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.720]   In some people who have painful intercourse,
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:00.400]   it's because they haven't had adequate time for arousal.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.700]   And so the penis is penetrating
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.600]   before they've had those adaptations to occur.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.640]   And also the labia open up to allow for that penetration.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.760]   So these things actually happen physiologically
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.960]   to allow for preparation.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.240]   So while some people may be aroused
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:15.320]   and get to that point quicker,
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.440]   some people do need a longer period of time
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.920]   of, as you described, foreplay.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.300]   And not everyone is the same,
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:23.480]   but I think it's important to have that discussion
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.500]   with your partner.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:27.140]   And lubrication is one of the ways
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.900]   that people assess arousal,
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:30.540]   but that's not the be all end all.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.500]   Some people just make a lot of lubrication
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:33.880]   and some people don't.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.680]   And certainly that changes with age and hormones.
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.720]   So if, certainly we know that after menopause
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:42.040]   with a drop in estrogen and testosterone,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:45.320]   you will see a decrease in lubrication.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.240]   And sometimes if people are on medications
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.160]   that can alter their hormonal access,
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.240]   they may also see changes in lubrication
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.660]   after, during breastfeeding,
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.180]   you can see changes in lubrication.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:57.120]   And again, this is not a, they're not aroused necessarily.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.460]   This is like a physiologic problem that they're having.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.900]   - Can we distinguish between arousal based lubrication,
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.780]   let's say sexual arousal based lubrication.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.620]   And again, folks,
[01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.620]   forgive me for being so hyper specific in language,
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.340]   but there are other forms of arousal
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.960]   besides sexual arousal that we know from,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   it's not a pleasant topic from reports
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.760]   of following sexual assault,
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.900]   that oftentimes the victim is demonized
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.120]   for having been lubricated and they will say,
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.480]   well then people will presume that somehow
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.840]   they wanted that interaction.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.280]   And that's not true in those cases.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.320]   It's clear that those, that the lubrication occurred
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:37.980]   independent of libido type arousal.
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:38.820]   - Exactly. - Right, okay.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:41.380]   So let's set that aside, again, unpleasant topic,
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:44.880]   but one that's important to flag.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.920]   Are there forms of non libido type arousal lubrication
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:58.240]   that allow for non painful or even pleasureful penetration
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.320]   that are important to distinguish
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.720]   from the arousal based lubrication.
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.720]   In other words, I have to imagine that women will have sex
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.380]   and it can be pleasureful or at least not painful.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.800]   And that might relate in some way
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.760]   to baseline levels of lubrication.
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.860]   And here we've been talking about lubrication
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:22.680]   mainly in the context of arousal.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.840]   You know, post-menopausal reductions in lubrication,
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.240]   but are there also post-menopausal reductions
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.600]   in baseline lubrication?
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:32.440]   Are some people's vaginas just more lubricated at,
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.360]   I won't say at rest, it's like a scientist in me,
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.400]   when they're asleep, for instance.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.080]   I mean, men are having erections in their sleep.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.600]   Are women getting vaginal lubrications
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:41.620]   in their sleep periodically?
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:42.580]   My guess is yes.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:45.580]   - Well, they're definitely getting clitoral engorgement,
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.840]   right, they're getting clitoral engorgement.
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.940]   There's been some studies on that,
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.560]   that they are also getting nocturnal tumescence, right,
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.780]   just like men do.
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:53.920]   As far as lubrication, you know,
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.700]   the data, at least from what I understand,
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.540]   is like there is a protective mechanism whereby women,
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.540]   when there's any sense that there may be penetration,
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:06.300]   that their body will immediately start creating lubrication.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.880]   And that is protective to avoid trauma and injury.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.100]   There's also baseline vaginal discharge.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:14.600]   That's completely normal.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.760]   Women will make physiologic discharge.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.560]   In fact, in our examinations,
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.160]   when we examine women, we'll say normal physiologic discharge
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.860]   because we see it, there's always discharge.
[01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:26.860]   And it can be up to like five milliliters.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.400]   And so it's not a small amount.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.240]   It can happen, it can be quite a lot.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.920]   - And it's menstrual cycle dependent
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.800]   in terms of the viscosity and the--
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.720]   - Yes, it changes over the cycle
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.320]   and it can be different in color and different in thickness.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.720]   And that's completely normal.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.600]   And I think that's a real problem
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.840]   in the feminine hygiene industry.
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.680]   You don't need to smell a certain way
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.920]   or reduce that discharge.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.760]   This is like completely normal, healthy.
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:54.120]   And you talked about chemistry
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.080]   and I know there's like not a ton of data on this,
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.080]   but there's like pheromones, right?
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.500]   There's scents that are coming from you,
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.800]   which are actually attractive to a partner potentially.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.200]   And in whatever physiologic,
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.680]   I don't know there's not a lot of data on this,
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.560]   but like there is that part of it.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:11.880]   So there's a lot of marketing towards women
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.080]   that you're dirty, you should be smelling like peaches
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.760]   or whatever. - Really?
[01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.160]   - There's a lot of marketing.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.460]   - Maybe this is a generational thing,
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.960]   but I learned early on,
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.280]   I think by behavioral neuroscience courses
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.280]   that vaginal lubrications were part of the arousal response
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.400]   for both, these were always framed in the context
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.640]   of heterosexual relationships, but both partners,
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.080]   let's just say both partners,
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.720]   because this could be a homosexual female relationship too.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.120]   We want to make the conversation as broad as possible.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.240]   And that the odor, let's just be frank here,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.240]   the odor and the taste played a role in both arousal,
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.140]   but also the pair bonding response
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.440]   that would establish future arousal.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.660]   And anyone that's ever been in a relationship
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:02.500]   that let's say had healthy sexual relations,
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.700]   I like to think his experience remembering somebody's smell
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:06.800]   or thinking about somebody's smell
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.020]   and that itself can be very arousing.
[01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.280]   Partners even, I'm smelling different articles
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.860]   of each other's clothing and that being arousing.
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:17.260]   So, I mean, this is the stuff of real physiology.
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:19.080]   We're not making this stuff up.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.160]   - But there is, there is a lot of marketing towards women
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.760]   that they should use douching or other things
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.120]   to clean themselves and it's damaging, right?
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.380]   It's actually, one, it can affect the vaginal microbiome
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.120]   so their pH is changing and that can affect their risk
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.920]   for UTIs or bacterial vaginosis.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.540]   And so they're buying these, spending their money
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.780]   on these things because they're being told
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.880]   that they're not clean and they come to the doctor saying,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.940]   "Oh, I'm, you know, I think I have an STD,"
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.620]   but it's like normal physiologic discharge.
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.380]   And so I think it's important to say that this is normal
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.880]   and it's normal to have an odor that is distinct to you
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.320]   and that there's, you know, of course,
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.740]   if you have like a fishy odor, that may be a sign of,
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:03.580]   like a very strong new novel odor that wasn't there before,
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.940]   that may be a sign of a sexually transmitted infection,
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:08.500]   but if it's your general odor that you've always had,
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:09.340]   that's normal.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.580]   - And what about other infections like yeast infections
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.620]   or bacterial infections of the,
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:17.100]   I got a number of questions about mycoplasma infections,
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.860]   which, you know, we don't hear that often about, but-
[01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.440]   - Yeah, so you can see if your discharge has changed
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.540]   and become more like cottage cheese-like
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:29.180]   or there's, you know, other symptoms like itching
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:30.860]   or discomfort, then, you know,
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:33.340]   those are signs to go get evaluated.
[01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.860]   Mycoplasma is another infection that we see in the vagina,
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.580]   but we also actually sometimes see in the urine.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.260]   And while it's not something we routinely test for
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.980]   when we have people who have symptoms
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:47.140]   of urinary tract infection and they're not improving,
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:50.300]   sometimes we will check for mycoplasma
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:53.620]   that could be causing symptoms in the urethra itself.
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.620]   - We've had a couple episodes about the gut microbiome.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.020]   My colleague, Justin Sonnenberg at Stanford,
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:00.540]   whose laboratory is directly above for mine,
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.220]   is expert in the gut microbiome,
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.580]   done a couple episodes about this.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.980]   And he reminded me, and I like to remind people,
[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.100]   that every mucosal lining of your body
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.540]   has a robust microbiome.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.340]   So that means intranasal, intravaginal,
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:17.200]   intraurethral in males and females.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.420]   There's an anal microbiome.
[01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.080]   There's a microbiome on your skin, on your eyes.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.720]   And you mentioned douching and other ways of,
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.040]   I'm gonna say quote unquote cleaning it
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.380]   because that language falls in line
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:31.460]   with the idea that it's a good thing.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:34.220]   You're telling me it's a bad thing in many cases
[01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.820]   because it's wiping out the microbiome.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:39.720]   What are some of the things that females can do
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.760]   in order to promote the health of their vaginal microbiome?
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:47.220]   - So it's really, our bodies are amazing.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.380]   The vagina is a self-cleaning oven.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:51.220]   You don't have to do anything.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.060]   You just wash- - I love that.
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:54.440]   The vagina is a self-cleaning oven.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.540]   I'm not gonna repeat that too often
[01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.460]   in too many different contexts,
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.700]   but I'm gonna remember it forever.
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:34:59.820]   - You will, you will.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:03.700]   And so all you need to do is wash the hair-bearing areas
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:05.620]   because those are the ones that create sweat
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.420]   and should be cleaned.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.580]   But other than that, let soapy water run down.
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.780]   You don't need to do anything.
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.980]   Your body will take care of it itself.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.900]   - When I was five years old,
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.060]   I pulled my parents in the bathroom and I said,
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:16.900]   they still talk about this.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.900]   I said, "I wanna know everything about sex.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:19.980]   I wanna know everything."
[01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.940]   And they were like, "Oh my God, what are we dealing with?"
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:23.540]   And I'll never forget, my dad just looked at me.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.760]   He's Argentine and he said,
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.020]   "Just remember, kids are the one thing in life
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.940]   you can't give back."
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:29.900]   That's all he said.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.180]   That was it. - That's it.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.980]   - That was it. - Oh gosh.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:35.660]   - Well, I will tell you my discussions with my sons are my son,
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.340]   my older son has been much more graphic than that.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.180]   I tell him- - Amazing.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.000]   - Yeah. - Amazing.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.600]   Well, I went out into the world and anyway.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.860]   - You figured it out. - Okay.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:46.080]   Let's spend a few minutes or more
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.740]   talking about female orgasm.
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:51.760]   One of the more cryptic topics on the internet,
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.340]   not because it isn't discussed,
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.020]   but because I think that the nuance of it
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.980]   isn't discussed often enough or in full depth.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.520]   So let's take the time we need to parse this.
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.040]   I think that the simplest way to parse it
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.140]   is going to be from the anatomical standpoint,
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.420]   clitoral orgasm versus so-called G-spot
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.680]   or penetration-based orgasm.
[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:17.660]   But of course, penetration-based orgasm
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.100]   is also a bit of a misnomer
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:23.520]   because there can be a clitoral stimulation
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.360]   by pelvic pressure or by digit.
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.700]   We're talking about fingers as digits
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:30.420]   because we're both in the medical/science profession,
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:31.440]   but we're talking about fingers here
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.020]   or something else, right?
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.300]   Vibrator, toy, whatever.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.280]   I'm toe for, it depends on how flexible you are.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.120]   I don't know.
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.520]   But the point being that I think the simplest way
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.080]   to go about this is going to be to talk about
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.460]   the distinction between clitoral orgasm
[01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:49.040]   and G-spot orgasm, however those are achieved.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:55.900]   And to also talk about this idea of graded versus absolute.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:58.940]   Okay, so this has actual parallels to neuroscience
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.780]   where we talk about communication between neurons
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.600]   being graded, meaning it's kind of one level,
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.220]   then a higher level, then a lower level,
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.020]   or all or none, right?
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:09.540]   How should I say this?
[01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:12.020]   It is clear in my life experience and observation
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.640]   that there are multiple kinds of female orgasm.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.500]   Those that are graded and in some cases cumulative,
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:22.180]   they sort of build towards a larger and larger orgasm.
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:24.500]   And then there are what some people have described
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.940]   as cliff-type orgasms where there's a refractory period.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.980]   I think that's a fair way to frame this.
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:32.060]   And clearly there are different responses
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:33.560]   to the orgasm response.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.780]   Some people get sleepy, some people get energized,
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.680]   some people, it heightens their desire for more.
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.960]   Some people, they need a period of time
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.700]   in which they become hypersensitive to touch.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.660]   So lots of different things going on there,
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.580]   psychologically, physiologically.
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.660]   Yeah, tell us all of it.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.180]   - So in terms of orgasm, right,
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:58.540]   I think it's important to distinguish
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.080]   that there is orgasm and then there's different areas
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:03.340]   that you stimulate to achieve orgasm.
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.220]   So some people will stimulate,
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:08.340]   the clitoris is probably the most reliable form
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.940]   of stimulation that will achieve orgasm.
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.180]   And when you look at the data,
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.180]   and again, female sexual dysfunction data
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.780]   is not super robust,
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:19.860]   but what we find is that about 85% of women
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.220]   require clitoral stimulation in order to climax.
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:27.060]   So very few actually climax through just
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:29.340]   vaginal penetration alone.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:34.340]   And so this is a real problem we're seeing on the media
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.660]   that you have sex and you penetrate,
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:39.260]   and immediately women are having orgasms.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:41.740]   That's not the reality for a lot of women.
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.980]   And in terms of stimulation,
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:46.000]   so like we've talked about throughout this podcast,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.700]   the clitoris is the homolog of the penis
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.120]   or the penis is the homolog of the clitoris,
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:50.820]   however you wanna say it.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:52.780]   - Good on you for getting it both directions.
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:55.120]   I probably would have screwed that one up.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.460]   - So clitoral stimulation is just like
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:38:58.760]   female stimulation for women.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.980]   That is very reliable.
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.940]   And there's a huge orgasm gap.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.660]   For men, it's pretty consistent
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.180]   that when they have a first-time sexual encounter,
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:08.620]   95% of men are having an orgasm.
[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.520]   When you look at first-time sexual encounters
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.780]   for women in heterosexual relationships,
[01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:17.540]   it's about 45 to 50% are having an orgasm.
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:20.700]   And when you look at homosexual relationships of women,
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.300]   it's again, 90%.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:25.600]   So there's clearly some lacking in-
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.480]   - 90% of female homosexual interactions
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.700]   that are first-time interactions,
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.420]   90% are having orgasm.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.260]   - Correct.
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:36.660]   - Presumably because they understand the anatomy of other
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.740]   by way of understanding the anatomy of self.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:39.580]   - So there's a huge gap.
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.180]   - And physiology and psychology of-
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:42.820]   - Yeah, that too, that too.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.580]   But you know, there's a huge gap there.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.220]   And so I think to bring it home
[01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.440]   is that clitoral stimulation is the most reliable way.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.980]   And as you mentioned, when you're stimulating vaginally,
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.420]   you're often, the clitoris is like a wishbone
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:56.060]   and it goes around the vagina.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:58.140]   And so you're often stimulating those,
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:00.740]   the crura is what we call the legs, I guess,
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.660]   for lack of a better term, of the clitoris.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:03.660]   And so you're stimulating that.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.680]   You're also stimulating the clitoral shaft,
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.620]   which goes deep into the pelvis.
[01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:13.060]   The G-spot is an area, is an erogenous zone
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.960]   where it's kind of in the anterior wall of the vagina,
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.060]   about two to three centimeters in.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.700]   That's the location of these periorhythral glands
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:22.340]   called the Skeen's glands.
[01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:26.420]   And they are analogous or homologous to the male prostate.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:30.200]   So just like some men have prostate play
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.740]   and enjoy pleasure from prostate stimulation,
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:36.100]   some women enjoy G-spot stimulation.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:37.340]   Now that's not universal, right?
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.060]   Not all men enjoy prostate play
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:40.780]   and not all women are gonna be aroused
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:42.860]   by G-spot stimulation.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:47.560]   And so I think there's a huge variety of ways
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.500]   you can stimulate anyone.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.860]   It can be man or woman.
[01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.220]   Some people will have orgasms
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.060]   through just nipple stimulation alone.
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:56.380]   Some will just hear something or see something
[01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:58.060]   and be able to achieve an orgasm.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.380]   And it's so varied from person to person.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:03.740]   And I think that the big take home from this
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:04.900]   for people listening is like,
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.700]   you have to talk to your partner.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.540]   And this is the hardest thing.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.900]   We never learned how to talk about sex.
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.220]   Like, what do you like?
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:12.460]   What do you not like?
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.780]   And don't take it personally, right?
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:17.340]   Like, I think a lot of times people feel like
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.500]   you have to orgasm to have pleasure,
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.980]   which may not be the case for everybody.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:24.780]   And if it is, how do you prioritize that
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.740]   for your relationship?
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:27.260]   So I don't know if I got off track there,
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:31.060]   but that's kind of, I think, the take homes for this.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.980]   And also the vaginal penetration,
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.620]   it's actually usually from cervical stimulation,
[01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:36.980]   not necessarily vaginal,
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.660]   because the large density of innervation of the vagina
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:42.460]   is in the first outer third of the vagina.
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.100]   The deeper two thirds of the vagina
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.140]   has much less innervation.
[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.940]   And yet there is such a thing as cervical orgasm.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:54.020]   So, and the cervix being further up the vaginal canal,
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:59.020]   is cervical orgasm specifically the stimulation,
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:03.120]   the foci of an orgasm that starts in the back of the vagina?
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:03.960]   Is that-
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.300]   - Yeah, so it's from stimulation of the cervix
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.900]   through whatever means, right?
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.180]   And that can be pleasurable and lead to orgasm.
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:15.100]   And again, orgasm is defined differently, right?
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.220]   But the one thing we know
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.420]   is that there are pelvic floor contractions,
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.260]   which are measurable.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:21.220]   So you can kind of tell that your partner
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.780]   is having an orgasm if you have a female partner,
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.820]   because you can actually feel those contractions, right?
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:30.860]   Whether it's on your digit or your organ or a sex toy.
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.260]   - Okay, super nerdy question here.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:34.160]   Years ago when I worked
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:36.020]   on hormone-based sexual differentiation,
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:36.860]   which by the way,
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.760]   we've done a episode of the podcast on previously,
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:45.140]   I learned that the levator ani muscle
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:49.020]   is the muscle that controls erection in males
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.540]   and presumably clitoral tumescence
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:54.060]   and an engorgement in females.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:55.280]   Is there an equivalent muscle
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.940]   responsible for the orgasm response
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.060]   or is the contraction of the pelvic floor
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.120]   part of a more general theme of muscular contraction
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:06.980]   and a bunch of different nerve roots contracting?
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.020]   The reason I asked this
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.380]   is that eventually in this conversation,
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:11.620]   we're going to migrate up toward the brain,
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.780]   but because this is a science and health podcast,
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.620]   when we talk about orgasm,
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.040]   of course, many people recognize that
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.060]   as their experience of it
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.340]   and their recognition of it in other people
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.940]   and descriptions, et cetera.
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.140]   But are we talking about a response
[01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.460]   that originates at a foci,
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.560]   kind of like in the brain,
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.360]   we talk about a seizure,
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.120]   starting at a focus of foci and then spreading out,
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.220]   or are we talking about a bunch of different nerve roots
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.660]   and brain centers firing in synchrony
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:44.620]   and that's why some people experience it
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:47.820]   as behind their forehead and in their genitals
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:49.740]   or as a whole body response.
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:51.420]   And here, we're not talking about the flood
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.180]   of neurochemicals into the body,
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:56.900]   I'm talking about during those moments of orgasm,
[01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:58.580]   what is happening neurally?
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.780]   I mean, it does have certain parallels to seizure, right?
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:02.660]   - It does, it does.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.180]   So let me go back to your first part of the question,
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.980]   which was about orgasm and, sorry,
[01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:11.740]   erection and tumescence being related to levator ani.
[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.500]   So actually, what happens during,
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.700]   the reason you get an erection
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.000]   and presumably clitoral stimulation the same way
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.060]   is blood flows into the erectile tissue
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.980]   and the tunica, which is the outer layers
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:26.580]   of the erectile tissue,
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:29.300]   which are two basically cylindrical-shaped structures
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.280]   in the penis and in the clitoris,
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:32.300]   they will fill with blood
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.220]   and then that tunica will compress veins on the outside
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.900]   to prevent blood flow from leaving.
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:38.560]   So it's not a muscular event,
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.380]   it's an actual blood flow event.
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:42.340]   - Then how come when we wanted to study
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:44.900]   erection behavior in rodents?
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:49.460]   We would give them injections of testosterone,
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.900]   females or males,
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.500]   and observe changes in sexual behavior accordingly,
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:57.060]   erection and clitoral tumescence,
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:59.260]   although it's harder to measure in rodents,
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:01.220]   there's a way of indirectly measuring that,
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.700]   and then we would measure the size and weight
[01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:07.160]   of the levator ani muscles as a readout
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.340]   of how androgenized that whole system was.
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.460]   In other words, what is the role of the levator ani
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.300]   in the sexual response?
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.740]   - So the levator ani, well, I say levator ani--
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:18.660]   - Well, you would know, I think.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:21.780]   - So those muscles are part of the pelvic floor, right?
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:26.520]   And so those contract when you climax, right?
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:28.500]   So whether it's orgasm for male or female,
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.900]   they're contracting and they're exercising, right?
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:34.060]   So that's how they would increase their strength
[01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:36.860]   or their density, if you're measuring that,
[01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:39.040]   through the actual climax of,
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.660]   which you can't see in rodents, right?
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.660]   So you're kind of using it as a surrogate in that way.
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:44.500]   So that's what happens.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.900]   Those muscles contract as a response,
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:49.240]   and climax is a brain-initiated event.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.760]   Orgasm is a brain-initiated event.
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.140]   So that's why, to answer your second part,
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:56.060]   you obviously feel focal response,
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:59.380]   but you also can feel a variety of responses
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:00.700]   'cause it's all coming from the brain.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:04.300]   It's not kind of the way you described it
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.300]   as like a ripple effect.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.840]   It's more of like a,
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:10.860]   it's the way your body responds to that particular stimuli.
[01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:13.960]   And it's actually like the ultimate form of mindfulness.
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.540]   You can't think of anything else
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:16.800]   when you're orgasming, right?
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.700]   So it's like, you have this moment of clarity
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:22.700]   and everything, you were very present in that moment.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.060]   And so people will feel different simulations
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:27.220]   depending on how their,
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:29.900]   how they kind of, how their nerves are,
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.740]   their sensations are, and things like that.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.780]   - It's perhaps a good time to mention dopamine.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:38.800]   We've talked about it a few times earlier
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.020]   when talking about the arousal arc
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.380]   that starts with parasympathetic, sort of calm,
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:46.320]   and then move, typically starts as calm,
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:51.320]   and then moves to the orgasm response.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.500]   We know that the orgasm response
[01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:57.860]   is associated with release of dopamine and then prolactin,
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.900]   which sets up the relative or absolute refractory period.
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:06.460]   The interesting thing, and I got some questions about this,
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:09.740]   is that there's literature, as I understand,
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:13.340]   about the elevation in dopamine caused by say,
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.580]   antidepressants like wellbutrin, bupren,
[01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:18.480]   which increases dopamine and norepinephrine.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:23.100]   People who recreationally use drugs like cocaine
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.320]   or other stimulants.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.660]   People who take Adderall, Vyvanse,
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:32.180]   or other drugs that increase levels of dopamine,
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:34.660]   because I did a whole episode about those drugs
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.460]   and they are different forms of amphetamine,
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.380]   unless we're talking about Ritalin,
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:38.940]   which is a little bit different.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.820]   And I got a lot of questions about people
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:47.120]   who experience feeling a lot of desire, sort of arousal,
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.500]   but not being able to achieve the physical arousal,
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.340]   erection or vaginal lubrication.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.340]   So it's almost as if they're sitting further
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.140]   along that arousal arc.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.020]   Hence the importance, I think, of people learning
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:04.720]   to have calm states of mind
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.880]   when going into sexual interactions.
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:09.580]   Now, I realize that in saying that it might be confusing
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:10.420]   because a lot of people think,
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:11.700]   well, that's anything but calm, right?
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:13.500]   Sexual arousal is anything but calm,
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.300]   but maintaining enough calm that they can ride that arc
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.180]   for whatever duration is appropriate
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:21.620]   for that interaction in them, right?
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:24.020]   'Cause again, and we should probably get back to this,
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.100]   some people will have sex for long periods of time,
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:29.220]   some for shorter periods of time.
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:31.320]   And here, people don't really know
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:32.220]   what other people are doing,
[01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:35.680]   except by way of pornography and self-report and discussion.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.680]   So is it the case that drugs that increase dopamine
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:43.620]   can inhibit the sexual response?
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.340]   Do they tend to promote the sexual response?
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:46.860]   Because I also mentioned earlier,
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.540]   there's this growing trend of people taking,
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.260]   by way of prescription, of course, from a physician,
[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:56.380]   combined apomorphine, which is a dopaminergic drug
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:49:00.140]   with Tadalafil, which is a PD-5 inhibitor,
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.820]   so it's going to increase blood flow.
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.480]   And I'm hearing about men and women,
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.800]   but mainly men doing this.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.380]   So ramping up their dopamine,
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.040]   ramping up their blood flow to their genitals
[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.840]   in order to have presumably more arousal and sex.
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:16.560]   Does that make sense as a mechanism?
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.680]   - Yes, so in terms of apomorphine,
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.020]   that has been studied,
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.140]   and it's mostly been approved outside of the United States,
[01:49:24.140 --> 01:49:26.420]   so we don't use it very often here in the United States
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.660]   'cause it hasn't been FDA-approved.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:30.660]   But it's a very complex response.
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:33.300]   So like I mentioned that flibanserin,
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:34.860]   which is a centrally acting medication,
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.460]   it actually has not only inhibitory,
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.740]   and not only stimulatory,
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.700]   but also inhibitory effects on dopamine.
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.700]   So the way it sort of works to enhance interest, or libido,
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:48.500]   is sort of complex and kind of confusing.
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:50.180]   When it was actually approved,
[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:52.700]   it was being studied for an antidepressant.
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:54.420]   And what they found was that women
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:57.860]   were actually having better interest in sex,
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:58.760]   or more interest in sex.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.620]   And so that's kind of how it was discovered.
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:02.540]   Similarly, Viagra was actually studied
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:03.920]   for high blood pressure.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.620]   And when they went to,
[01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:08.300]   it was horrible blood pressure medication,
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.060]   but then the men who took it
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:12.260]   actually didn't return the samples for the study.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.900]   So they realized like, "Oh, what's going on here?"
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:15.740]   And it was because they were having better erections.
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:19.660]   - Is it true that at some urology meeting
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.900]   that the first description of Viagra
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:26.220]   as a treatment for erectile dysfunction
[01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:27.860]   involved the speaker actually coming out
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.380]   from behind the podium and revealing his erection?
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:31.580]   Is that a true story?
[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:32.900]   - Yes, I don't think it was Viagra.
[01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.420]   I think it was an intracavrenosal injection though.
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.560]   I think he came out.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.400]   It is a true story.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.620]   There's actually a published article.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:41.540]   I'll send it to you so you can share it if you'd like.
[01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:42.620]   There's a published- - I'm not sure I want to see it,
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.420]   but I'll read the article.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:46.580]   - There's a published article about people
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.060]   who were attending at the meeting.
[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:49.020]   And yes, he came out.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:51.820]   And at the time, like it was mostly men in urology,
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:54.040]   but there were like spouses, I guess, in the audience,
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.540]   which is not typical now.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:57.820]   But so there were women in the audience
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.600]   and he came out with a full-on erection
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.980]   to show that it worked.
[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.460]   - Well, I suppose at the urology meeting
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.140]   or OBGYN meeting where a woman comes out
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:09.500]   and reveals her enhanced vaginal lubrication,
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:13.060]   then we will have gender and sex balance
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:14.500]   at the meetings on urology.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:17.700]   It'll be interesting to attend one of those someday.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.460]   So differences in arousal
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.380]   as a function of stage of the menstrual cycle.
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:25.360]   Really interested in this.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.040]   I did a long episode on fertility
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.100]   and we're going to have a few other IVF experts,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.340]   fertility experts on the podcast.
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:38.640]   But clearly there are differences in hormones
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.900]   across the menstrual cycle.
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.000]   We know that for sure.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.020]   Clearly there can be psychological variation
[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:48.300]   according to those hormones,
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:50.100]   but probably other things across the menstrual cycle.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.700]   And it's always an imperfect experiment
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:54.800]   because we aren't laboratory rats
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.620]   and people are having different interactions
[01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:57.980]   across the menstrual cycle.
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:02.980]   Is there any known correlation between desire
[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:05.400]   and stage of the menstrual cycle?
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.060]   There are some obvious assumptions that one might make,
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.400]   prior to ovulation, et cetera,
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.860]   around the time of ovulation.
[01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:14.100]   But what about the other direction too?
[01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:17.060]   Is there a category of women that are very interested
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.860]   in sex at certain stages of their menstrual cycle
[01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:20.660]   and then not at all interested in sex
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:22.580]   at other stages of the menstrual cycle?
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.860]   - All the data that I've heard,
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:27.220]   and maybe a gynecologist could speak more on this
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:29.200]   'cause they studied those variations a little better,
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:32.740]   but there is data to suggest that libido does increase
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:35.860]   prior to ovulation and during ovulation.
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.820]   I think it's like a couple of days prior
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:40.020]   because that's the optimal time for fertility.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.860]   So yes, there is data to suggest that
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:46.380]   in terms of like completely lack of interest,
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:49.380]   I don't believe there's data, but I'm not sure.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:50.420]   - Is there evidence that females
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.860]   who perhaps have not experienced so-called G-spot orgasm
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:57.700]   or cervical orgasm can learn to do that?
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:59.860]   And I always find it interesting
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:01.800]   that whenever there's a discussion
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:04.380]   about different forms of female orgasm,
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:06.540]   people are careful to point out
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:10.620]   that many women don't have penetration-based orgasm
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:13.660]   and then they separate out clitoral stimulation
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:17.520]   as a more common route to orgasm.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:19.900]   But of course, there can be clitoral stimulation
[01:53:19.900 --> 01:53:21.700]   with penetration. - Absolutely.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.980]   - Right, and depending on the physical arrangement,
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:26.360]   there can be clitoral stimulation
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.420]   purely by way of penetration through pelvic contact,
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:33.180]   fingers, et cetera.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.900]   So yeah, so how should we think about this?
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:36.940]   How should we talk about it?
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:38.340]   - So there was an interesting study
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.780]   that I just read recently
[01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:43.540]   where they gave women words for these things, right?
[01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:47.320]   So there's like the rocking stimulation,
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.560]   so that can also stimulate,
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:51.620]   so meaning that you're penetrating,
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:53.740]   but there's like a rocking motion
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:55.400]   that can also penetrate the clitoris.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.200]   There's stimulation of just the outer part of the vagina,
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.180]   which again, as I mentioned, the G-spot is there.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:02.440]   It's more highly innervated,
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.020]   so that can be more stimulating.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:06.180]   There's also ways to align yourself
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:07.360]   so that when you're penetrating,
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.300]   you're putting pressure on the clitoris.
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:11.820]   And then there's stimulation with,
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:13.620]   like actual stimulation of the clitoris,
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:14.900]   like intentional stimulation
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.380]   either by yourself or by the partner.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.460]   And so there are multiple different ways to do that, right?
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:24.180]   And so I think that it's important to really kind of,
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:26.780]   it's okay to explore and not always be a home run.
[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:28.660]   And I think that's like when you get into a relationship
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:31.140]   where you're maybe second, third, fourth time
[01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:32.640]   having intercourse with someone
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:35.080]   that you can try and explore these different things,
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.240]   or if the partner themselves knows what they like
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.020]   to actually tell the other partner, right?
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:40.620]   There's a huge part of communication
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:42.640]   that I think plays a huge role in this
[01:54:42.640 --> 01:54:44.920]   because we know ourselves better than anyone else.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:47.380]   So you can tell your partner what you like.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:50.280]   And I think that we have never been taught how to do that.
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:55.020]   - Yeah, such important conversations for so many reasons.
[01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.220]   As you point out,
[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.300]   definitely not something they teach people in school,
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:00.860]   except they might say something about,
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.240]   communication is important.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.140]   And that almost always circles back
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:06.740]   to the key four things we talked about earlier,
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.700]   which is that consent and age appropriate,
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.820]   context appropriate, these kinds of things.
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:16.820]   And obviously substances like alcohol and other drugs
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:20.080]   can strongly confound those issues.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:23.440]   And so we'll just leave that as a kind of an obvious one.
[01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.100]   As long as we're talking about communication
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.420]   around sexual interactions,
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.940]   perhaps it would be useful to people
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:34.280]   to cultivate a language or a nomenclature there too,
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.020]   to facilitate that.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.420]   Some of the language that I've heard that is quite useful
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:44.500]   is things like, people have different arousal templates.
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:46.660]   Some people, certain ideas are stimulating to them
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:49.000]   and other ideas are aversive to them.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.860]   And then there's this category in between
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:53.020]   where sometimes people sort of either don't know
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:55.340]   'cause they haven't tried it or haven't thought about it,
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:58.100]   or they're sort of curious, but kind of unsure,
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:59.860]   or it might work in the right context,
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:01.260]   but maybe not all the time.
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:04.740]   So is there any kind of structure
[01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:09.700]   that's been put out there as a way to improve communication
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:11.380]   around sexual interactions?
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:13.180]   - Yeah, I mean, there's no like script,
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:14.620]   but I think in general,
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:16.760]   you wanna have the conversation outside of the bedroom.
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.020]   So not like right before sex or right after sex,
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.200]   because that leads to like a sense of insecurity
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.100]   for the other person, right?
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:23.980]   Did I do something wrong?
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:25.340]   Did something go wrong here?
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.000]   So you wanna kind of move those to a neutral location.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.100]   So like kitchen table, in the car, whatever,
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:33.100]   somewhere where sex is not gonna happen,
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:34.980]   at least for that particular moment.
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:36.340]   And--
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.980]   - We have folks listening,
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:41.620]   some challenging conversations on this podcast,
[01:56:41.620 --> 01:56:43.820]   previously challenging because you're trying
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:47.420]   to get things clear and as clear as possible.
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:49.940]   This one's challenging because there's so many caveats
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:50.900]   to everything, right?
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:54.360]   We don't, of course, we love sex in cars, right?
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.340]   Or they did when I was growing up,
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.740]   and sometimes they still do.
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.620]   Okay, please continue.
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.340]   - Yes, so that's one.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:03.900]   And then two, like when you're discussing it,
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:06.500]   I mean, this is kind of goes for any difficult conversation
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.400]   is like you make I statements, right?
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.540]   You say, I like it when this, I don't like it with this.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:12.860]   It's not something you did, right?
[01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:14.740]   It's not you didn't do this, you didn't do that.
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:16.860]   It makes kind of an animosity sort of situation.
[01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.380]   And then, you know, I think also part of it
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:21.620]   is like being open about those things.
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.940]   And it may, it's not gonna happen in one conversation.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:24.820]   I think that's the hard part.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.420]   Like you think you're gonna have a conversation,
[01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:28.440]   it's gonna go great and things are gonna be better.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.440]   It's gonna be like multiple conversations.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.440]   And some of them are not gonna go well, right?
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:34.520]   So like, that's another place
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.740]   where you can actually get the help of a sex therapist.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:38.180]   And there is a website for that.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:41.500]   It's A-A-S-E-C-T, asex.org,
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.520]   where you can look for a sex therapist near you,
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.900]   and you can even do those things virtually.
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:47.780]   And so that can be really helpful
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:51.140]   when you're having difficulty having a conversation.
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:54.440]   - Yeah, I think, again, such important conversations.
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.700]   And then when people differ
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.420]   in terms of their level of experience,
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.980]   it gets potentially problematic,
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:04.100]   but also it can be potentially educational.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:07.580]   And then of course, there are the twists and turns
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.760]   that occur with when one is asking
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:11.900]   about somebody else's arousal template,
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.740]   oftentimes you'll learn things about people's sexual past.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:18.740]   And that can be either neutral, stimulating, or aversive,
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.680]   right, that can open up all sorts of other issues
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:22.540]   related to the psychological interplay.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:24.820]   So there's no way we can parse all of those now.
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:27.020]   I just think it's worth highlighting
[01:58:27.020 --> 01:58:28.620]   that it's understandable
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.660]   why those conversations are challenging.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:33.500]   And it also is understanding
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.060]   why pornography isn't going to involve those conversations.
[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:38.820]   The only conversations there are between your brain,
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.820]   your hands, and your eyes, and your ears.
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:44.700]   Not going to highlight any particular order there.
[01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:50.420]   I want to switch gears slightly and talk about UTIs.
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:53.460]   I got a lot of questions about urinary tract infections.
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:57.180]   Let's make it related to both females and males,
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:59.540]   because yes, males get urinary tract infections,
[01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:00.540]   females get them.
[01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:03.380]   More females asked about urinary tract infections,
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:04.560]   how common are they?
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.700]   Should they always be treated with antibiotics?
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:08.820]   Is cranberry really a good treatment?
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.920]   If so, why are there other things that are better?
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.480]   Is it related to the acidity or alkalinity?
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:17.940]   How does one prevent getting UTIs?
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.460]   Can you get them from swimming?
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:21.640]   Should you urinate after sex?
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:24.220]   Tell us about UTIs and how not to get them
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.380]   and how to get rid of them.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.220]   - Happy to.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:29.500]   So UTIs are very common in women.
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:32.720]   Probably up to 50% of women get at least one UTI
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:34.060]   in their lifetime.
[01:59:34.060 --> 01:59:37.300]   And up to a third of them get recurrent UTIs.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:39.980]   And what that means is they have two or more in six months
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:42.300]   or three or more in a year.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.500]   Now, this is common, and so we'll see a lot of it.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:48.700]   And it's not as, until you're having recurrent UTIs,
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:49.900]   say you just have one a year
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.700]   or you have one every few years, it's not a huge issue.
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:56.300]   In men, however, UTIs are much less common.
[01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:58.460]   And that's because the urethra is longer.
[01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:01.540]   So there's less entry from the outside world
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:03.820]   into the bladder, which causes infections.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:07.900]   And so when men get a UTI, it's concerning.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:10.220]   Like, why is a man getting a UTI?
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:12.580]   You know, there's multiple reasons that it could happen,
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.600]   but it should be investigated
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.540]   so that you can make sure there's no anatomic abnormality
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:18.780]   or functional abnormality
[02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:21.660]   with a bladder that's causing the UTIs.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:26.260]   In terms of prevention, there are kind of major things
[02:00:26.260 --> 02:00:27.460]   that are highlighted in the guidelines
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:29.380]   that we all talk about.
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:30.740]   So one is hydration.
[02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:32.100]   So making sure you're drinking
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:35.500]   about two to three liters of fluid, ideally water a day,
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.900]   'cause dilution is the solution to the pollution, right?
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:40.940]   So drinking more fluids is gonna get that bacteria
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:41.860]   and you're gonna pee it out.
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:42.700]   It's gonna help keep,
[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:45.360]   not let it sit around in the bladder very often.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:49.680]   Another thing in women who have altered states of estrogen,
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.380]   whether it's post-menopausal, surgical menopause,
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:56.960]   or maybe have reduced estrogen for postpartum
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.040]   or other reasons.
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:00.480]   - What about during the second half of the menstrual cycle?
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:02.980]   - Well, not necessarily for those specific people,
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.440]   but for those specific times,
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.960]   but 'cause it's pretty short-lived.
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:10.440]   I guess you could use it, but is vaginal estrogen.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.020]   So vaginal estrogen,
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.000]   meaning estrogen that's applied in the vagina
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.540]   either through a cream, a suppository, or a ring
[02:01:17.540 --> 02:01:21.220]   is highly effective in reducing the occurrence
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:22.700]   of recurrent UTIs.
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:26.980]   And this is because when you have low estrogen,
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.060]   the pH in the vagina goes up.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.480]   And the pH in the vagina goes up
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:34.260]   because there's less conversion of glycogen to lactobacilli.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.620]   And then those lactobacilli are preventative for UTIs.
[02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:40.300]   So essentially you wanna reduce the pH
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:42.500]   back to its normal acidic pH.
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:45.100]   And vaginal estrogen is very effective at doing that.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:46.140]   In fact, in our clinics,
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:49.100]   we'll actually check a vaginal pH
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.180]   to see if there is an indication
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.200]   that their pH is too high,
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:53.820]   that maybe they do need vaginal estrogen,
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.300]   particularly around the perimenopause,
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:57.240]   'cause it's hard to tell just by looking
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.560]   if they are really heading
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.440]   into a lower estrogen state sometimes.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:05.440]   And so that's very, very effective and very, very safe.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:08.600]   So when you look at estrogen,
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:10.980]   the Women's Health Initiative way back when
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:12.820]   sort of made a big stink
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:15.540]   about how estrogen is related to cancer.
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:17.860]   However, vaginal estrogen
[02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:20.580]   has never ever been a reported breast cancer,
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:23.380]   uterine cancer, or any other blood clot,
[02:02:23.380 --> 02:02:26.100]   any other adverse event associated with vaginal estrogen.
[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:28.900]   You can get some breast tenderness, some discharge.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:30.740]   Those things can occur.
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:34.460]   But the absorbed amount vaginally is so little
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:37.300]   that your estrogen level barely goes up.
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.780]   It doesn't even reach premenopausal level.
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:42.340]   So it just goes up very slightly in the bloodstream,
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:44.920]   not enough to create any sort of abnormality.
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.500]   So vaginal estrogen is extremely safe,
[02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:48.840]   and it's pretty affordable.
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.200]   You could actually use coupons
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.020]   if your insurance doesn't cover it
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:54.900]   through GoodRx or Mark Cuban's pharmacy
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.380]   and get it very, very affordably.
[02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:58.040]   And it's very effective.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:00.340]   It does take about three months to work.
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.020]   So you have to be consistent.
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:03.820]   You apply it about twice a week at night,
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:05.820]   sometimes three times a week.
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.020]   And it's very effective.
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:08.940]   The ring you put in once and it lasts for three months.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:10.620]   But so generally speaking,
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:14.820]   that's the most effective option for low estrogen states.
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:17.040]   Other kind of simple things are trying to make sure
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:19.200]   you're completely emptying your bladder.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:20.520]   So over a lifetime,
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.220]   people can develop some mild pelvic floor dysfunction.
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.120]   Not enough to create pain or discomfort,
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.380]   but maybe they're not emptying completely, right?
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:29.200]   Because maybe they used to hold their urine
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.020]   for long periods of time when they were a kid,
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:32.820]   or maybe they're always hovering over the toilet
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.300]   'cause they don't wanna sit on it at work.
[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:35.140]   And over time,
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.400]   that can create a little bit of mild dysfunction,
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.820]   which can make it more difficult to completely empty
[02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:40.660]   the bladder.
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:42.380]   And when urine is sitting in the bladder
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:43.700]   for long periods of time,
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:45.820]   it's basically food for bacteria to grow.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:48.420]   And so bacteria grows and then you get recurrent UTI.
[02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:50.860]   So making sure you've completely empty by sitting,
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:53.740]   relaxing on the toilet, sometimes leaning forward,
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:55.320]   and then maybe going a second time.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.260]   So standing up, sitting back down, going again.
[02:03:57.260 --> 02:03:59.420]   And even for men sometimes trying to sit
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.900]   and see if you completely empty,
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:01.820]   'cause sometimes standing,
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:03.300]   you're not able to empty completely.
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.980]   - Whoa, a lot of men are gonna,
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.740]   because they're these,
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:08.380]   it was fun to research for this episode
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:11.240]   because there are entire discussions on Reddit
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.460]   about like what percentage of males sit while urinating.
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:15.760]   I mean, my understanding,
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:18.580]   based on having visited many male bathrooms in my lifetime
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:23.420]   and just being in the world that I assumed
[02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:25.420]   that men stood up in order to urinate,
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.820]   but there are a decent percentage of men
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:28.800]   that sit down to urinate.
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:29.640]   - There are.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.320]   And in fact, it's variable by country.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.920]   And probably the reason it's become more interesting lately
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:35.060]   is immediate. - By country.
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:38.060]   - So a certain country was recently surveyed.
[02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:39.820]   I think it was Germany,
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:42.420]   but essentially this recent, like picked up by the media,
[02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:44.740]   that Germans sit more often to pee.
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.260]   And so then people are like,
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:49.020]   "Oh, is this better for me to sit to pee or stand to pee?"
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:50.800]   And there's this whole big discussion on the media.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.300]   But the reason being is when you're sitting,
[02:04:53.300 --> 02:04:55.140]   your pelvic floor is most relaxed.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:57.580]   And so if you're having any issues emptying your bladder,
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:59.460]   you're gonna pee better.
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:00.980]   Also, if you have an enlarged prostate,
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:04.320]   which I'm sure we're gonna talk about prostate enlargement,
[02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.860]   that can sometimes allow you to develop
[02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:08.760]   a little bit more intra-abdominal pressure
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.580]   'cause you're sitting and you can lean forward
[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:13.380]   to overcome sort of a blockage.
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:18.380]   And so there are some indications where sitting is better,
[02:05:18.380 --> 02:05:20.260]   but if you're peeing fine and you're standing,
[02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:21.300]   that's fine too.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.420]   I don't think you have to.
[02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:24.620]   I think it's just something that in other countries,
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:26.160]   they do more and here we don't.
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.220]   And I don't think it's right or wrong.
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.040]   It just depends on your individual circumstance.
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:34.500]   - Can spermicides or condoms or both increase
[02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.540]   the frequency of UTIs for females?
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.980]   - So spermicides, absolutely.
[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:41.240]   So spermicides, if your condom has spermicide on it
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.440]   or you're using spermicides,
[02:05:42.440 --> 02:05:45.780]   that is a known risk factor for UTIs.
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:46.940]   Other things I wanna touch on,
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.200]   you did ask about cranberry.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.200]   So cranberry is actually
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.940]   in the American Urological Association guidelines
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:54.880]   for prevention of recurrent UTIs in women.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.620]   Now, how does cranberry work, right?
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:58.180]   Like, do I just drink juice?
[02:05:58.180 --> 02:06:01.700]   It's actually a specific active ingredient in the cranberry,
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:05.260]   which is called proanthocyanidins or PACs.
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:08.680]   And they've actually looked at the amount of PACs you need
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.820]   and what formulation.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:14.100]   So you need 36 milligrams of PACs in a soluble form.
[02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:15.900]   So a lot of the supplements on the market
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.380]   will say that they're 36 milligrams of PACs,
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:19.760]   but they're like the whole berry.
[02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:22.180]   So they're using the skin of the berry
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:24.340]   and the stem of the berry, and that's not gonna help you.
[02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:26.940]   So you need to make sure that the supplement you're using
[02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:28.980]   is a soluble form of the cranberry.
[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:31.140]   And it's actually very, very effective
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.340]   at reducing the risk of UTIs.
[02:06:33.340 --> 02:06:37.060]   - So do you mean capsules, like a gel cap?
[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:40.040]   - Yeah, it's a capsule that you take once a day.
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.140]   And there is some, although not as much data
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:43.740]   that if you're having them around sex,
[02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:47.860]   which some women do always have post-coital UTIs,
[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:49.820]   that you can take two on the day of sex
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:52.220]   and two on the day after, and that may be helpful.
[02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:53.820]   But there's not a lot of data there,
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:55.460]   but certainly an option that you can try
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:57.840]   that's pretty low risk.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:06:59.900]   So that's kind of the guidelines.
[02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:02.540]   Now there's a ton of other things that you can do
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.140]   to help prevent that are kind of available
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:06.660]   and have some data behind them.
[02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.740]   So D-Manos is one of them, where you take, you know,
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:12.460]   about two grams a day of D-Manos and you drink it,
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:15.240]   and that actually helps reduce UTI risk.
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:16.980]   It's been studied in a small, randomized,
[02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.940]   controlled trial to be effective.
[02:07:18.940 --> 02:07:21.500]   And so those are kind of the bigger ones.
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.020]   There's other things that people use, like probiotics,
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:26.500]   but there's a lot of heterogeneity, as you know,
[02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:28.220]   in probiotics and what to take,
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.740]   and are they really effective vaginally
[02:07:30.740 --> 02:07:32.260]   in the flora there.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:33.940]   So those are kind of the big things.
[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:36.980]   And there is actually a lot of microbiome study
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:39.260]   and UTIs going on, actually, at UCLA,
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:41.860]   where they're looking at the microbiome
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:44.420]   of people who are more at risk for UTIs
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:46.660]   or even overactive bladder, other conditions like that,
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:47.800]   and they're trying to figure out, like,
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:49.940]   is there something here that we can target
[02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:52.300]   or that we can figure out is causing problems?
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.020]   Because sometimes we just can't figure out
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.800]   why it's happening.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:58.500]   In terms of wiping from front to back
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:01.420]   and swimming and peeing after sex,
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:04.100]   there's no good data on any of those things.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.280]   Wiping from front to back,
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:07.620]   I think it does create a little bit of, like, shame.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:10.200]   Like, it's not a big deal if you wipe back to front,
[02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.460]   as long as you're not, like, you know,
[02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:13.520]   as long as you've, like, cleaned yourself, so to speak.
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.820]   So I think it's less of an issue.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:17.480]   - But what we're talking about is you're referring
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.980]   to any contamination from any bacteria around the anus.
[02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:21.820]   - Correct, yes.
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:24.500]   And a lot of women who have recurrent UTIs,
[02:08:24.500 --> 02:08:26.440]   like, tend to come and feel very dirty.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.280]   Like, there's something wrong with them.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:29.040]   They're like, oh, I wash all the time.
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:29.880]   I'm really clean.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:30.700]   I'm really this.
[02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.380]   And, you know, it's not something they're doing.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:35.900]   It's probably a microbiome effect or a hormonal effect,
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.520]   or, you know, there's something going on
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.900]   that we need to investigate further.
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:41.380]   It could also be an anatomical or functional problem
[02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.860]   where you're not emptying the bladder correctly.
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:45.220]   So there's lots of different factors it could be,
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:47.940]   and it's, like, very infrequent.
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:50.780]   I would say, like, I've never seen a patient who's dirty,
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:53.500]   and that's the reason they're getting UTIs.
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.220]   - Perhaps even the opposite is true.
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:56.180]   They're cleaning too much,
[02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:57.700]   based on what you told us earlier,
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:00.780]   and they're eliminating the gut micro, excuse me,
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:02.340]   just rolls off the tongue.
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:03.540]   Again, no pun intended.
[02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:08.220]   Perhaps it's, they are abolishing the local microbiome
[02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:09.040]   on the skin.
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:11.840]   Too much cleaning eliminates the microbiome on the skin.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:13.140]   Not that we don't want to wash,
[02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:16.100]   but when Sonnenberg was a guest on this podcast,
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:18.780]   he said actually kids can develop a very healthy gut
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:22.700]   microbiome and general microbiome oftentimes by,
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:25.260]   sorry, parents, not washing their hands before eating
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:27.780]   if they've been playing with soil outside or dirt.
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:29.220]   A little bit of that is actually healthy.
[02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:31.860]   Pets actually offer microbiome support.
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:32.680]   This is so weird.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:34.540]   I know it sounds kind of dirty,
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:36.860]   but we have to imagine how we evolved as a species
[02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:38.760]   was not with antibacterial soaps
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:41.740]   and alcohol swabs everywhere.
[02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:44.020]   And obviously we don't want infections,
[02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:46.580]   but over cleaning can disrupt the microbiome,
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:48.660]   which presumably can lead to UTIs.
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:51.460]   So perhaps someone who's cleaning excessively
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:54.260]   is more at risk than somebody who's cleaning a little less.
[02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:55.100]   - Absolutely.
[02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:58.420]   And actually the cleaning can irritate the dermis, right?
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:01.100]   So you can actually get contact dermatitis type symptoms
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.000]   from over cleaning.
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.780]   And so that's one of the things we're like,
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:05.900]   I definitely have a UTI, I definitely have one.
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:06.780]   Well, no, you don't,
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:09.280]   but there's a host of other things that it could be.
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.620]   One of them could be that.
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:12.660]   Another very common one that we already touched on
[02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:13.980]   is pelvic floor dysfunction.
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:15.820]   So very often pelvic floor dysfunction,
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:17.780]   just like you had pain with urination,
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:20.000]   women can also develop pain with urination
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:20.900]   that doesn't go away.
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:23.320]   And it can start where they had a UTI
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:25.140]   that triggered the pelvic floor
[02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:26.900]   and then the pelvic floor just didn't relax,
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:29.340]   where the pain just triggered the pelvic floor to tense up.
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:30.780]   It didn't relax because again,
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:33.240]   we're not taught how to relax our pelvic floor.
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:35.620]   And then they've developed pelvic floor dysfunction.
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.080]   Like why is the UTI not going away?
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.660]   Or why does it keep coming back?
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:41.960]   And so that's another common thing that we see
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.460]   in people who have quote unquote recurrent UTIs,
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:45.780]   but don't really have them.
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:47.900]   To be clear, I experienced the pain and urination
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.900]   as a consequence of trying those damn kegels
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:50.980]   that everyone was talking about.
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:55.300]   Stopping that was informative in two directions.
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:57.280]   One, it relieved the pain very quickly.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:58.180]   So that was good.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:01.820]   The other was, I realized that it is possible
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:05.020]   to have a pelvic floor that's neither hyper contracted
[02:11:05.020 --> 02:11:07.220]   nor over relaxed, and in some cases,
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.720]   just not doing anything for it is the best circumstance.
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:13.140]   Right, so, and the only reason I mentioned that
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:15.740]   is because obviously this discussion
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:17.240]   is not about my pelvic floor.
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:19.340]   This discussion is about the fact that
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:22.660]   some people perhaps need to clean less.
[02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:24.260]   Some people may be more,
[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:25.880]   but probably not based on what you said.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:27.720]   Some people might need to strengthen their pelvic floor.
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.380]   Some people might need to relax their pelvic floor.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.020]   And some people's pelvic floor is probably A-okay.
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:36.420]   You know, I think any discussion about anything medical
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:38.160]   or, you know, especially hormone stuff,
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.260]   this happens a lot in the discussions around
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:44.220]   that I get into, it seems, with males.
[02:11:44.220 --> 02:11:46.220]   They're like, every male now seems to wonder
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:48.300]   if their testosterone is too low,
[02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:50.060]   except the ones that are blasting testosterone
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:52.460]   'cause they know it's excessively high.
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:54.580]   And as you pointed out earlier,
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.860]   at least in terms of sexual function,
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.100]   that's unlikely to be the case.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:02.220]   Maybe less desire, but in terms of
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:04.780]   genital-based arousal function, probably to do.
[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:06.300]   - Yeah, and I mean, you've talked about testosterone
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:08.240]   a lot on the podcast, so I'm sure your audience
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:11.280]   knows very well the multitude of benefits for testosterone.
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.600]   So I think there is value in assessing hormone panels
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:18.020]   and assessing your level of free testosterone and testosterone
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:20.280]   and, you know, assessing if you're having symptoms
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:21.760]   that are not always sexual, right?
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.780]   It can be depression, it can be weight gain,
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:26.420]   that you're not gaining muscle mass,
[02:12:26.420 --> 02:12:28.100]   you can have cognitive changes.
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.100]   So those things can still be a sign of low testosterone
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:33.420]   and very valuable and important to assess.
[02:12:33.420 --> 02:12:34.680]   - That reminds me of another thing,
[02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.680]   and then we'll get back to UTIs
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.980]   and I want to talk about kidney stones.
[02:12:37.980 --> 02:12:41.920]   But I've heard of women using a small amount
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:45.320]   of testosterone cream directly on the clitoris
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   as a way to amplify the,
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.320]   maybe it's the desire and arousal effect,
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.480]   or perhaps just one or the other.
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.000]   - So the way that we discuss testosterone use,
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.720]   and there are like consensus statements,
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.240]   and there's actually an abundance of data on testosterone use
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:04.640]   particularly in post-menopausal women for low libido
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:07.860]   or low sexual desire, and it's all been very positive.
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:10.560]   And since there's been increased sexual desire
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.240]   based on validated questionnaires,
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:14.940]   increased number of sexually satisfying events
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:16.320]   with testosterone use.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.400]   Now the range of testosterone in women
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.720]   is about a 10th of the amount of testosterone a man needs.
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:26.080]   So testosterone cream is systemically absorbed
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:27.280]   wherever you apply it.
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:30.640]   And so the way we generally recommend women to try this,
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:32.120]   if they are having low libido
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:33.920]   and we've ruled out other issues
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:36.760]   that may be psychologic, you know, relationship,
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:38.980]   other issues that can affect libido medications,
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:41.400]   there's a lot of things obviously that go into that.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.520]   But if we say, and we've checked their testosterone,
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.880]   it appears to be low for physiologic levels for women,
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:49.360]   which again is 1/10 of the male level,
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.020]   then we can actually prescribe off-label testosterone.
[02:13:53.020 --> 02:13:55.200]   And the guidelines, or the consensus statements,
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:56.180]   they're not like true guidelines,
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:59.720]   but they recommend using transdermal testosterone.
[02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:03.160]   So getting, you know, androgel tubes from the pharmacy
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.240]   and putting a 10th of one tube on the back of the calf
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.700]   or the upper outer buttock, a hairless area for absorption
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:14.040]   that can improve desire overall.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.560]   And then the other place we use testosterone
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.520]   is in women who have what we call vestibulodynia.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.140]   So the vestibule is the area outside the vagina,
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.800]   which is very hormonally active.
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:27.100]   There's lots of androgen receptors there.
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:30.320]   And it can actually, when you have hormonal issues,
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:33.560]   meaning lower testosterone and estrogen in that area,
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:34.840]   it can cause pain.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.200]   And so actually applying a combined
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.560]   or compounded estrogen testosterone cream to that area
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.280]   over time can reduce that pain and discomfort.
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.240]   So as you know, testosterone receptors
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:48.400]   or androgen receptors all over the body,
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:50.320]   very much in the genitals, very much in the brain,
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.300]   and they're a very useful place
[02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.740]   to treat women for those issues.
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:56.580]   - Thank you.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:00.560]   - Kidney stones, I hope to never have one.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.400]   - I hope you don't either.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.320]   - But people get them.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.480]   How do you avoid getting them
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.200]   and how do you get rid of them?
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.960]   - So kidney stones very often are,
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.920]   they can be for a variety
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920]   of different metabolic disorders, right?
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:18.660]   So it can be, one, dehydration is a very common cause of it.
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:21.120]   So dehydration combined
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:23.200]   with maybe a slight metabolic abnormality
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:26.880]   where you're creating more calcium or oxalate in your urine
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.020]   can result in kidney stones.
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:31.940]   And so how can you prevent them?
[02:15:31.940 --> 02:15:33.720]   I mean, each person is individual.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:34.920]   If you get a kidney stone,
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.080]   typically we do what's called a 24-hour urine analysis
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:39.960]   plus some blood work to assess
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.760]   what is the metabolic abnormality
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:45.920]   so we can target that either with diet or with medication.
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:49.000]   And so the kind of general recommendations
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.680]   for people who have kidney stones,
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:53.660]   one is increase your fluid intake to two to three liters.
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:56.160]   Again, the same number I told you before.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.320]   You wanna decrease your oxalate intake.
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:15:59.440]   Now, if you Google oxalate,
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:02.000]   you're gonna find a million things that you eat
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.140]   that have oxalate in them,
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:05.880]   but the big ones are spinach and rhubarb.
[02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:07.220]   We're seeing a lot of nuts too
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:10.160]   that are people eating a lot more nuts to get more protein.
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:11.600]   So cutting back,
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.000]   it's impossible to get rid of all of that in your diet,
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.920]   but if you're having like a spinach salad every day,
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:17.840]   well, switch it to a different green, right?
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:19.840]   Don't eat spinach every day.
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.200]   Also, you wanna increase your citrate intake.
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.680]   That's an inhibitor of kidney stone formation.
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.400]   So increasing fruits and things like that
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.520]   to increase citrate vegetables as well.
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.880]   Actually, one easily accessible thing is crystal light.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:35.520]   It has a high citrate composition,
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.700]   so you can drink crystal light with that two to three liters
[02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:39.820]   and that can be helpful.
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.220]   You wanna decrease your protein intake.
[02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:46.360]   So high levels of purines or purigenic meats
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.440]   like red meats and things can also put you at higher risk.
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.000]   So these are kind of the general sort of
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.640]   preventative measures we talk about for kidney stones
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.600]   if you have a kidney stone.
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.720]   So a lot of times people can have kidney stones
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.540]   in their kidneys, they're not creating any problems,
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:04.720]   they're tiny, we can observe them over time.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:07.520]   If they start coming, if they start getting very large
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:10.440]   or they are starting to move into the ureters
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.280]   or the tubes that drain the kidney,
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.840]   oftentimes they're accompanied with pain,
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:18.800]   quite a bit of pain and it can be very uncomfortable.
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:22.880]   In those cases, if they're not having any infection symptoms
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.920]   and there's no signs of a urinary tract infection,
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.600]   there's no fevers, no chills,
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:30.920]   we can treat it conservatively with pain medication
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:33.760]   and also there are medications like Flomax
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:36.040]   which we use for enlarged prostate as well
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.720]   that actually relaxes the ureteral smooth muscle
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.220]   to allow the stone to pass a little bit better.
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.600]   If you're having an infection,
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.040]   you gotta get it treated right away.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:47.480]   You can get very sick very quickly.
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:50.400]   In fact, I've seen young, healthy patients,
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:51.860]   like they're healthier than me,
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:53.660]   walk in the ER with a kidney stone
[02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:56.160]   and within 24 hours they're in the ICU
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.320]   'cause they're really sick because of a kidney stone.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:01.860]   - So fever, urinating, tea-colored urine,
[02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:03.680]   so meaning blood in the urine,
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:05.420]   all of those are important warning signs
[02:18:05.420 --> 02:18:06.960]   that you ideally don't get to.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:07.920]   - Yeah, blood in the urine,
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:09.160]   I mean, it doesn't always mean infection,
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:10.840]   it could just be irritation from the stone,
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.800]   but certainly fevers, chills,
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:14.400]   or you have a sign of an infection
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.000]   and the stone looks like it's blocking,
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.640]   so if you get imaging and you see what's called
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:20.540]   hydro nephrosis or pressure behind the kidney
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.720]   and you have these signs of infection,
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:23.540]   we don't wanna wait
[02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:25.540]   because you can get sick pretty quickly.
[02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:28.640]   And then to treat the kidney stones,
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:30.160]   there's three major options.
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:33.320]   One is shock waves, another is ureteroscopy
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.520]   where we go in with a camera and we have a small laser,
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.800]   we break it up into small pieces and take it out.
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.160]   - Where is the camera inserted?
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:40.000]   Through the urethra?
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.960]   - Correct, you're asleep under anesthesia
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:43.000]   so you don't have to--
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.320]   - You saw that, you saw the wince.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:49.120]   - And then percutaneous nephrolithotomy,
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.920]   which is done if you have a large kidney stone
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:54.360]   or a very hard kidney stone that's up in the kidney,
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.920]   you can go in through the back with a small,
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:00.440]   like a small incision and with a specialized camera
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:03.160]   that goes in and uses ultrasonic lithotripsy
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:06.360]   to break up that stone and kind of suck it out that way.
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:10.480]   - These are extremely helpful bits of information,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.160]   or not even bits, this is an enormous amount
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:15.080]   of useful information.
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:19.000]   I'd like to pivot again for sake of breadth.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.640]   We can't go into extreme depth on everything,
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:23.720]   but appreciate your willingness
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:25.780]   to follow this carousel with me.
[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:28.960]   Oral contraception.
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:30.320]   Previously on this podcast,
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:33.800]   I hosted a female physician guest
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:38.800]   who offered both sides of female oral contraception,
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.560]   discussed some of the benefits, discussed some of the risks.
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:45.660]   I made the decision to post clips about both
[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:49.760]   on the internet and wow, wow, wow,
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:54.760]   was I surprised, but also frankly a bit shocked
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:20:01.560]   and then finally intrigued by how polarized
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:05.840]   the discussion is around female oral contraception
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:08.160]   and female contraception in general.
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:13.160]   So NuvaRing, Norplant, The Pill,
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.760]   broad category of things there,
[02:20:14.760 --> 02:20:18.260]   but for sake of discussion, The Pill, et cetera.
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:21.720]   I mean, it seemed that approximately 50% of responses,
[02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:24.360]   which seemed to come mainly from women,
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:27.760]   were of the, this stuff is terrible.
[02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:29.040]   It ruined my life.
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:30.440]   It ruins lives.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.880]   It destroys you.
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:34.780]   It has immense risk.
[02:20:34.780 --> 02:20:38.300]   And then the other half seemed to say, no,
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:41.840]   there's reduced risk of certain forms of cervical cancer.
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.020]   This has allowed me the sexual choices and lifestyle
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:49.400]   that I prefer without risk of pregnancy.
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:53.480]   I mean, it was astonishing to the point where I thought,
[02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:56.120]   wow, if only I could post both clips simultaneously.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:21:00.720]   So obviously I don't know what the answer is,
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:04.620]   but I do know that this is among the more polarizing topics
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:06.080]   available for discussion.
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:09.420]   So what is the story?
[02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:12.160]   Meaning, what are the data about oral contraception?
[02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:16.200]   Why so much controversy and what's the real deal here?
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:19.120]   - Yes, so it is a very polarizing topic
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:22.280]   and there is abundance data, abundant data.
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.940]   In fact, we even did a study, and again,
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:27.120]   this is not like high quality evidence,
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:28.860]   but we looked at Reddit threads
[02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:30.380]   and we looked at sexual dysfunction,
[02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:33.360]   specifically low libido, orgasmic difficulties.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:35.400]   And we read hundreds of threads
[02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:38.540]   and we did a qualitative analysis to see, in females,
[02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:41.280]   to see what are people talking about.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:44.120]   And problems with oral contraceptives
[02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:47.760]   and antidepressants leading to low libido
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:50.000]   and being very, as you described,
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.600]   very like this has ruined my life, was very common.
[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:57.620]   And so the theory is that taking oral contraceptives
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:01.480]   increases the amount of sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:22:01.480 --> 02:22:04.480]   which binds testosterone and estrogen.
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.160]   And that actually makes testosterone less available,
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.520]   which is, as we've talked about,
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:10.840]   a very important hormone for desire.
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:13.760]   And so in some subset of people,
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:17.480]   they're seeing very significant consequences
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:19.340]   of taking oral contraceptives.
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:22.160]   Now, I think that there is, you know,
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:24.560]   we don't know which women are gonna have this problem
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.400]   and we don't know how.
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.700]   It's probably a very small subset of people,
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.080]   but we do know that this does happen
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:32.840]   in that when you measure SHBG levels, they're up,
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:35.720]   and that even after they stop the oral contraceptives,
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:38.920]   you'll see elevated SHBG levels from baseline.
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:40.120]   - For how long?
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:42.240]   - You know, for like at least four months afterwards,
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:44.120]   you'll still see elevated SHBG levels.
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:46.360]   So we don't know. - But not infinite.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:47.520]   - We don't know.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:49.000]   - Yeah, the endocrine system is weird
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:52.760]   because we assume everything has a short-term effect,
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:54.960]   but there's some plasticity in the system,
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.600]   especially 'cause it's a neuroendocrine system.
[02:22:56.600 --> 02:22:58.040]   - Exactly, yeah. - So, yeah, okay.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:59.920]   - So I think, yeah, there's some neuroplasticity there
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:02.920]   that occurs as well, and so we do see this,
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:05.000]   and I think that the other side of it is,
[02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.320]   yeah, absolutely, oral contraceptives are amazing, right?
[02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:09.400]   They're helpful for sexual freedom,
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:13.780]   for preventing pregnancy, for a lot of things,
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:16.280]   and particularly other conditions too, like PCOS,
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:18.880]   and other problems, oral contraceptives are amazing,
[02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:22.240]   and they've changed gynecology and management
[02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:25.880]   of these women in a very positive way.
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:27.440]   And so I think, you know, yes,
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:31.560]   I do think that there is oral contraceptive-related
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:35.560]   sexual dysfunction, usually low-dose estrogen
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:38.280]   sort of contraceptives are the culprit,
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.480]   but, you know, I think that it's, again,
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:43.400]   the data, female sexual dysfunction literature
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:46.920]   is just not as robust as male sexual dysfunction literature.
[02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:49.280]   - I saw a lot of comments about how oral contraception
[02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.760]   had led to depressive-like symptoms,
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:56.360]   or just kind of ahedonia and apathy,
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:58.120]   not just lower libido.
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.680]   I can imagine how that would be the case
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:02.800]   through the elevated sex hormone binding globulin,
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:05.880]   which is, you know, preventing testosterone and estrogen
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:10.880]   from being free, literally, and exerting their effects
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:13.080]   on not just the body, but the brain.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.440]   But is there any evidence that oral contraception
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.320]   can disrupt, you know, transmitters?
[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:18.400]   I'm not aware of any.
[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:20.240]   - I don't think so, not to my knowledge.
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:25.240]   - Okay, well, it sounds to me like oral contraception
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:29.320]   for women, 'cause that's where we normally hear about it,
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:31.640]   it sounds like there's a varied response
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:33.040]   and it's highly individual.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.320]   I certainly had partners that loved the pill,
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:36.460]   or at least didn't seem to mind it.
[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:39.240]   I've had some that hated it and like,
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:41.940]   it's like, no way, tried that, never will.
[02:24:41.940 --> 02:24:45.180]   Or, you know, just went with other forms of contraception,
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:47.400]   or for whatever reason, we're not using contraception.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:51.820]   So it seems to me that there's a lot of variation out there.
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:55.680]   How does one explore that without risk of permanent damage?
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.560]   It sounds like truly permanent damage is unlikely.
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.540]   You know, what are the other options?
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:05.420]   You know, is the ring copper IUD?
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:09.860]   - So any sort of long acting hormonal contraceptive,
[02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:12.940]   we've seen, that's what we counsel patients on,
[02:25:12.940 --> 02:25:15.400]   is if they're having issues with oral contraceptives,
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:16.780]   even if they come in with pelvic pain
[02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.040]   and they're on oral contraceptives,
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.420]   I'll tell them, you know what, just stop,
[02:25:19.420 --> 02:25:23.380]   because maybe the effect on the androgen receptors
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:25.360]   or estrogen receptors is affecting, you know,
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.880]   the lubrication or other things, we're not sure,
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:28.960]   but you know, why don't you stop
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.560]   and go get a long acting contraceptive method?
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:33.060]   - Like an IUD? - Like an IUD.
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:35.700]   - And are IUDs safe?
[02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:36.920]   And here we should probably say,
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.980]   okay, copper IUD is one form.
[02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:40.300]   You want to mention a few of the other forms of IUDs?
[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:42.100]   - So I don't prescribe IUDs,
[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:44.100]   but generally speaking, they're very safe.
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.380]   Of course there's risk with any sort of, you know,
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:48.700]   it's a procedure, you're inserting an IUD.
[02:25:48.700 --> 02:25:51.180]   So there's obviously some small risks associated with it,
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:54.660]   but it is safe and effective form of contraception.
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:56.960]   - If people are wondering why the copper IUD
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:59.540]   is an effective form of contraception,
[02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:04.540]   copper is like the third rail for sperm, as I understand it.
[02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:07.460]   So much so that I was able to find some evidence
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:11.500]   for this in the medical textbooks that in the old days,
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:15.860]   as I say, prostitutes who wanted to avoid pregnancy
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:18.900]   would put copper pennies in their vagina.
[02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:23.020]   Now I don't recommend that to anyone, and please,
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:28.020]   and I don't think it's a foolproof form of contraception,
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:30.860]   but there is evidence that that did happen.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:31.860]   So, which is amazing.
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:34.300]   That means that people somehow figured out
[02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:36.440]   the copper sperm relationship,
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:38.000]   which isn't a good one for the sperm,
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.220]   and deduced from that a behavior.
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:42.460]   - Yeah, that's- - I mean, that's cringing.
[02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:44.820]   I am not suggesting people do that.
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.220]   I think it's just an interesting medical factoid.
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:51.100]   I can tell you want to move on from this topic.
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:52.740]   So we will.
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:57.380]   Before discussing prostate and anal sex,
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:01.580]   not stated next to one another for any particular reason,
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:04.300]   I want to talk about SSRIs.
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:06.780]   A lot of people over the last 20, 30 years
[02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:10.540]   have been prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.180]   and other antidepressants that have disrupted
[02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:18.540]   their sexual function or their sexual desire,
[02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:19.640]   it seems in particular.
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:22.860]   Do you see a lot of this in your clinic?
[02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:24.060]   Do you hear about it?
[02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:25.680]   What can people do about it?
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:31.600]   Oftentimes these sexual arousal or dysfunction issues
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:34.480]   associated with SSRIs and other medications
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.700]   make those medications prohibitive for people.
[02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:42.420]   So serotonin is kind of the anti to orgasm.
[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:45.800]   And so in fact, we will use SSRIs off-label
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:48.380]   for people who are having premature ejaculation.
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:50.220]   So it delays ejaculation.
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:52.100]   And then there's also other sexual dysfunctions
[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:53.300]   we see with it.
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:54.340]   And it does happen, absolutely.
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:55.420]   It's dose dependent.
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.500]   So in some cases,
[02:27:57.500 --> 02:28:00.540]   when someone comes in with SSRI related dysfunction,
[02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:02.040]   if they're doing well,
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.340]   you can either try to reduce the dose
[02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:07.700]   or switch them to another antidepressant,
[02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:08.920]   for example, Wellbutrin,
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:12.740]   that does not have such severe effects on sexual function.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:17.460]   And so you can also use like Cialis and Viagra,
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:18.900]   what we've talked about for erectile dysfunction
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:19.740]   as an addition,
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:22.140]   if we can't change their medication management,
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:23.100]   because, you know,
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.020]   and this gets a little bit complicated
[02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:27.460]   because we know erectile dysfunction and depression
[02:28:27.460 --> 02:28:28.860]   are very interrelated.
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:32.220]   Now what's causing what and where do we,
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:35.860]   like maybe somebody went to see their doctor for depression,
[02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:37.540]   but was also having issues with erections.
[02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:39.440]   And now what do you, if you fix the erections,
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.780]   do you help with the depression?
[02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:41.780]   Like what, you know what I mean?
[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:42.660]   So I think- - Males everywhere
[02:28:42.660 --> 02:28:44.420]   are shouting yes. (laughs)
[02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:45.380]   - So I think, you know,
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:46.980]   I think that there's a lot of discussion
[02:28:46.980 --> 02:28:47.820]   that has to be had there.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:50.780]   It's a lot easier to talk to your primary care doctor
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:53.060]   about depression than it is about your erections.
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:55.580]   And so I think it's important to like really dig into that
[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:57.380]   a little bit, but yes,
[02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:59.180]   it is definitely a known thing.
[02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:01.540]   We use it to our advantage when needed.
[02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:05.580]   And it can be helpful to switch medications
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:07.180]   or reduce the dose.
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:09.020]   - You mentioned earlier that trazodone
[02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:11.940]   can cause sustained erection.
[02:29:11.940 --> 02:29:14.460]   And is trazodone in the category
[02:29:14.460 --> 02:29:17.620]   of touching the serotonin transmission system?
[02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:19.860]   - You know, I don't remember the mechanism,
[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:23.200]   but interestingly, trazodone is also used for off-label,
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:24.660]   like as a third or fourth line
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:26.900]   for premature ejaculation as well.
[02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:30.300]   So I don't remember the mechanism off-hand.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:35.380]   - Let's talk about prostate and prostate health.
[02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:40.380]   Earlier, I queued up that there's a growing trend toward,
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:44.920]   I would say more progressive male physicians
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.020]   or physicians who treat males, excuse me.
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:48.900]   - Thanks for that.
[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:51.020]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:54.380]   Prescribing low dose, 2.5 to five milligram Cialis,
[02:29:54.380 --> 02:29:57.240]   which is to dalafil, which may assist with erections,
[02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:01.760]   but the rationale for this low dose, daily low dose,
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:03.880]   is not centered around erections per se.
[02:30:03.880 --> 02:30:06.580]   It's really about prostate health,
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:10.100]   improving blood flow to the prostate, reducing prostitis,
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:13.460]   maybe even reducing the probability of prostate cancer.
[02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:18.140]   What other sorts of things are you encouraging men
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:21.160]   to think about when thinking about their prostate?
[02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:23.880]   - Yeah, so before I forget,
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.060]   I want to mention that low dose to dalafil
[02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:28.100]   is actually a treatment for erectile dysfunction.
[02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:30.200]   In fact, it works quite well,
[02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:31.280]   particularly in men who are having
[02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.800]   a lot of psychogenic issues.
[02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:34.080]   One, because they don't have to remember
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.840]   to take a pill before sex.
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:37.420]   It's always on board.
[02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:39.980]   And you're taking five milligrams every day,
[02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:42.140]   and it has a 36 hour half-life,
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:43.980]   so you're kind of increasing those,
[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:45.980]   so it can actually work quite well,
[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:48.220]   and is a great option for erectile dysfunction.
[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:50.420]   So I do want to make that caveat.
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:52.260]   In terms of prostate health,
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:54.820]   it has been shown to be effective for BPH,
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:56.100]   or enlarged prostate.
[02:30:56.100 --> 02:30:57.980]   And this is a very common condition.
[02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:00.420]   In fact, if you look at autopsy studies,
[02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.380]   80% of men at 80 have an enlarged prostate.
[02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:04.940]   Like, it's very, very common.
[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.660]   Now, does everyone get symptoms,
[02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:08.620]   and what's the long-term concerns of it,
[02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:10.340]   and what can you do about it?
[02:31:10.340 --> 02:31:13.340]   So typically, as the prostate enlarges,
[02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:14.500]   it's right around the urethra.
[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:15.700]   It's a walnut-shaped gland,
[02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:18.020]   sits underneath the bladder around the urethra,
[02:31:18.020 --> 02:31:20.780]   and it can narrow the urethra, or the P-tube.
[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:23.060]   And so, over time, you can imagine,
[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:25.220]   like if you're, I always give this example,
[02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:26.580]   if you're sucking from a straw, right,
[02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:27.740]   you're drinking from a straw,
[02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:29.820]   if you have a wide-diameter straw,
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:30.980]   it's really easy to drink.
[02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:32.340]   If your straw gets really narrow,
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:33.700]   like say you take a coffee straw,
[02:31:33.700 --> 02:31:34.740]   and you drink out of that,
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:36.500]   it's very difficult to drink.
[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:40.260]   Very similarly, it can become very difficult to urinate
[02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:42.360]   if you have an enlarged prostate.
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:44.440]   Now, what causes an enlarged prostate?
[02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:46.060]   There's a whole host of factors.
[02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:47.140]   A lot of them are genetic,
[02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:50.220]   so if your father or your grandfather had a large prostate,
[02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:53.700]   you're probably more likely to have an enlarged prostate.
[02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:57.180]   Do we know exactly how to prevent that?
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:59.420]   Not exactly, but we know how to mediate
[02:31:59.420 --> 02:32:00.540]   the symptoms a little bit.
[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:02.340]   So, the other symptoms you'll see
[02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:04.260]   before you have difficulty urinating
[02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:06.700]   is sometimes you'll see overactivity.
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:09.520]   So, you'll see your bladder's responding
[02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:12.300]   to having to push hard against that narrow urethra
[02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:13.260]   to push urine out.
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:14.920]   So, it's having more urgency,
[02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:16.740]   like the sudden desire to go to the bathroom
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:18.020]   that you can't delay.
[02:32:18.020 --> 02:32:19.780]   You're maybe going more frequently,
[02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:22.700]   and very often, you're going more often at night.
[02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:25.260]   And so, those are kind of the first signs people will see.
[02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:27.940]   And then over time, it may become more and more difficult
[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:28.860]   to empty the bladder.
[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:30.480]   You might see some hesitancy,
[02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:32.620]   like you're waiting for your stream to start,
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:34.900]   or it stops and starts.
[02:32:34.900 --> 02:32:36.700]   And so, those, you know, or you're just like,
[02:32:36.700 --> 02:32:38.060]   I can't empty, like it's not,
[02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:40.220]   'cause it drips or a very weak stream.
[02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:42.060]   And so, those are kind of the things
[02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:43.760]   that can happen over a lifetime.
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:47.180]   Now, what are some things that you can do to help?
[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:50.380]   You know, Cialis helps relax the fiber,
[02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:51.540]   the smooth muscle of the prostate,
[02:32:51.540 --> 02:32:54.260]   so that it allows urine to pass more easily.
[02:32:54.260 --> 02:32:55.620]   There's also other medications
[02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:56.920]   that you can treat very often.
[02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:01.820]   Flomax or other alpha blockers are helpful in that area.
[02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:04.100]   In terms of like things that you can do in general
[02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:05.920]   for bladder health, prostate health,
[02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:08.660]   there are certain things that are irritants to that area.
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:10.100]   And so, what I tell people,
[02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:12.180]   not everyone's affected the same way.
[02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:13.380]   So, I don't want people to be like,
[02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:16.820]   oh, I gotta stop all these delicious things I eat and drink,
[02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:19.380]   but certainly it can be useful to just pay attention.
[02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:22.980]   So like, if you say you drink coffee every day
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:24.940]   and you find yourself running to the bathroom a lot,
[02:33:24.940 --> 02:33:27.340]   if you limit your caffeine intake,
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:28.860]   you might see that you're not going to the bathroom
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.740]   quite as often because caffeine is a bladder irritant.
[02:33:31.740 --> 02:33:34.420]   So, that can be coffee, tea, chocolate, you know,
[02:33:34.420 --> 02:33:37.140]   things of that nature that have caffeine in them,
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:38.420]   energy drinks, sometimes people forget
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:39.760]   they have caffeine in them.
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:43.860]   And so, limiting that may improve your symptoms.
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:46.020]   Alcohol also is a bladder irritant.
[02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:48.260]   And these have actually been studied in animal models
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:51.480]   and you'll see that the bladder contracts more often
[02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:54.320]   when they're given these sorts of substances.
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:55.540]   And it's dose dependent.
[02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:57.260]   And some people can actually habituate
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:33:59.900]   or get used to a certain dose of caffeine.
[02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:01.460]   So, if you're drinking coffee every day,
[02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:03.620]   you may have less symptoms than someone who drinks it
[02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:05.620]   every once in a while.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:09.540]   Other things can be sometimes carbonated beverages,
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.940]   spicy foods or acidic foods,
[02:34:11.940 --> 02:34:14.100]   those sorts of things can also irritate the bladder lining.
[02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:17.180]   So, sometimes limiting those things may be helpful
[02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:18.960]   in those situations.
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:19.980]   - Thank you so much.
[02:34:19.980 --> 02:34:22.040]   That's very informative.
[02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:26.060]   Years ago, there was a discussion about bicycle seats
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:27.660]   causing damage to the prostate,
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:29.260]   maybe even sexual dysfunction.
[02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:32.140]   Is that still a thing?
[02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:35.420]   I thought they put grooves into the seats,
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:38.820]   but I've also in reading on the internet,
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:40.500]   I didn't do a deep dive on Reddit,
[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:45.300]   but seems that women are reporting some bladder incontinence
[02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:47.440]   from excessive bicycle seat use,
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:50.940]   maybe even exercise bike, doesn't have to be road bike.
[02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:52.540]   - Yeah, so this is a great point.
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:54.460]   So cycling, if you think about it,
[02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:55.900]   you're sitting on your perineum,
[02:34:55.900 --> 02:34:57.500]   which is that space for men
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.000]   between the scrotum and the anus,
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.660]   for women between the vagina and the anus.
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:03.220]   And right there runs your pudendal artery
[02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.340]   and your pudendal nerve,
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:06.800]   which are again responsible for blood flow
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:08.700]   and nerve function to the area.
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:10.860]   So the most common things we see in people
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:15.420]   who are really high volume cyclers now,
[02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:17.400]   the studies have looked at like,
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.860]   maybe they did a 350 kilometer race
[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:22.920]   or they're biking three times a week for 60 minutes,
[02:35:22.920 --> 02:35:24.600]   but there's no like consistency,
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:28.220]   but they're seeing pretty high rates of genital numbness.
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:33.220]   So like up to 50% and also in men erectile dysfunction.
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:35.380]   In women, you'll also see numbness,
[02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:39.020]   but because sensation is a big part of arousal,
[02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:41.540]   you'll also see kind of decreased lubrication,
[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:44.100]   maybe decreased arousal as well in women.
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:46.700]   And so how can you prevent that?
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:48.540]   The reason is because when you're sitting,
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:50.100]   particularly if you're leaning forward,
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:52.420]   like competitive bikers do or aero riding,
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:55.700]   you're putting pressure on the beak of the bicycle seat.
[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.620]   And that's where most of the,
[02:35:57.620 --> 02:35:59.820]   it's not your weight, it's not distributed evenly.
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:01.940]   So the goal is to take a bike seat
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:04.220]   that allows you to sit comfortably
[02:36:04.220 --> 02:36:05.940]   on your ischial tuberosities.
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.900]   And posture is a huge part of your pelvic floor.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:09.340]   I know we didn't talk about that earlier,
[02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:12.340]   but sitting with good posture
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:16.000]   and not kind of slouching or leaning forward
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.400]   can actually really do wonders for your pelvic floor.
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.240]   So focusing on posture is helpful,
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:21.900]   but also when biking posture is helpful.
[02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:23.700]   So they've actually looked at this data
[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:25.980]   and they found that people who aero ride,
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:27.140]   meaning lean forward,
[02:36:27.140 --> 02:36:30.000]   or people who use narrow bike seats
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.700]   are more likely to have issues.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:34.140]   And so you wanna get kind of a noseless seat
[02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:35.540]   and a wider seat.
[02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:37.420]   The cutouts actually,
[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.780]   when they've looked at kind of mechanics of the cutouts,
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:42.660]   they'll see higher pressure around the opening.
[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:46.060]   So it's actually not good to have a bike with a cutout,
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.060]   a bike seat with a cutout because they've seen,
[02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.500]   at least with some of the cutouts,
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:51.340]   the pressure actually becomes higher on the area
[02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:53.600]   that's right around it.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.700]   - Very important point.
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:58.260]   I don't cycle, I don't like the exercise bike.
[02:36:58.260 --> 02:37:00.620]   I'll sometimes ride the assault bike for,
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:03.180]   which has the big seat for a few minutes, but.
[02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:05.960]   - I just wanna add one thing
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:09.880]   because I think that I don't wanna make people not cycle.
[02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:11.080]   I think it's really valuable.
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:13.360]   Cycling is a great aerobic exercise,
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:16.140]   has lots of benefit for cardiovascular health.
[02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:18.180]   But there was actually another study
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:21.140]   that looked at people who were parts of sports clubs.
[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.060]   So they were like swimmers, runners, and cyclists.
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:26.760]   And they looked at rates of dysfunction
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:28.020]   and they found that actually
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:30.660]   the rate of erectile dysfunction was not different
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:33.500]   between runners, swimmers, and cyclists.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:35.620]   So maybe, because those other sites
[02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:36.940]   were just looking at cyclists,
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:39.700]   that maybe it's just the general rate of erectile dysfunction
[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:41.580]   in that population at that point in time.
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:44.680]   So the numbness is definitely an issue.
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.940]   The erectile dysfunction, maybe, maybe not.
[02:37:47.940 --> 02:37:50.500]   - So I just have a couple of more questions for you.
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:52.260]   And by the way, you've been incredibly generous
[02:37:52.260 --> 02:37:54.700]   with your time and information here.
[02:37:54.700 --> 02:37:55.540]   - Oh, thank you, thank you.
[02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:57.500]   - So I really appreciate it,
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:37:59.420]   as I'm sure our listeners do as well.
[02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:04.740]   Anal sex, you recently did a post describing
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:09.740]   the multiple reasons why women do or do not have anal sex.
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:12.340]   Very interesting post, very interesting study
[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:13.180]   that you covered.
[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:15.300]   And you explained it very clearly.
[02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:19.480]   I'm guessing there are relatively few,
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.980]   but perhaps some other studies as well about this.
[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:25.460]   Let's talk about anal sex.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:30.020]   And maybe if you could just offer some of the,
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:32.420]   the key bullet points that you've learned
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:35.540]   from the literature and from your clinical practice.
[02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:40.540]   How frequent is it with protection, without protection?
[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:42.340]   How safe is it?
[02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:47.180]   What are the different reasons people do it?
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:48.860]   That might seem like a kind of a silly question,
[02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.500]   but it turns out when it comes to this topic,
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:52.660]   it's, they're interesting data.
[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:54.700]   Yeah, educate us.
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:57.660]   So anal sex, let's talk about it.
[02:38:57.660 --> 02:39:00.700]   Well, when you talk about anal sex,
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:03.100]   the reason people, it's become more and more common.
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:05.820]   Let's say it's more and more heterosexual couples
[02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:06.660]   are doing it.
[02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:09.940]   We know that male homosexual couples are having anal sex.
[02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:12.300]   And I think the one thing is that it's safe
[02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:13.380]   in terms of pregnancy, right?
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:15.500]   You're not gonna get pregnant from anal sex,
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:18.460]   which is one of the reasons people do engage in anal sex.
[02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:19.460]   - Do you think that's the reason people
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:20.700]   are doing it more frequently?
[02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:23.060]   - No, I think that's one of the reasons that people,
[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:24.580]   one of the reasons people do it.
[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:28.260]   But in general, the issue with anal sex
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:31.220]   is that people forget to use protection,
[02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:32.540]   like a condom, for example,
[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:34.300]   because sexually transmitted infections
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:36.820]   are actually more likely with anal sex
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.620]   than they are with vaginal penetrative intercourse,
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:43.980]   because the anal tissue is very thin and friable.
[02:39:43.980 --> 02:39:45.380]   So when you penetrate the anus,
[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:48.700]   particularly if you have any trauma,
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:51.380]   you can have, you know, you can have blood loss
[02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:52.780]   and that blood loss can then easily,
[02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:54.820]   more easily transmit sexually transmitted infection.
[02:39:54.820 --> 02:39:57.300]   So it's really important to use a condom
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:59.460]   and use adequate lubrication.
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:03.460]   The anus does not make any of its endogenous lubrication.
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.420]   You have to use lubricant.
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:07.580]   The other interesting thing about anal sex
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:11.260]   is that the anus pH is different from the vaginal pH.
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:13.500]   So you wanna use specific lubricants
[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:16.060]   that are isoosmolar to anal pH.
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:19.020]   So you can actually look up anal lubricants.
[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.300]   And we could talk about lubricants,
[02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:23.420]   but generally there's water-based, silicone-based,
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:24.820]   oil-based lubricants.
[02:40:24.820 --> 02:40:27.780]   Water-based are the most easily accessible.
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:29.580]   Silicone-based are a little more slippery
[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:30.780]   and last a little longer.
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:32.540]   And oil-based also last longer
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:34.220]   but are not good for use with condoms.
[02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:36.420]   So definitely using lubricants
[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:39.860]   and always kind of making sure to be,
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:42.100]   in the context, of course, of being consensual,
[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:45.740]   but also like never force, always take your time.
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:48.220]   And those things are really important to avoid trauma
[02:40:48.220 --> 02:40:50.180]   because trauma can happen.
[02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:52.460]   And usually it's not severe trauma, right?
[02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:54.380]   It's not gonna create long-lasting problems,
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:57.260]   but it is inconvenient, uncomfortable,
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:40:59.060]   and probably we're not seeing as much of it
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:00.460]   because they're not coming to the emergency room
[02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:03.460]   if they're having issues unless it's really serious.
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:04.780]   So I think it's really important,
[02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:07.020]   one, to prevent from sexually transmitted infections,
[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:09.700]   two, to be thoughtful and cautious.
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.540]   And sometimes it requires some preparation
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:13.020]   if you're gonna penetrate an anus.
[02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:17.420]   It's gonna, you're not gonna start with a large girth item.
[02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:18.660]   You're gonna start with something smaller
[02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:20.100]   and kind of work your way up.
[02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:24.100]   And then I think ultimately why people have anal sex.
[02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:25.500]   So as I mentioned earlier,
[02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:28.020]   the prostate is highly innervated
[02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:29.620]   and can be a source of pleasure.
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:30.980]   So some people enjoy that,
[02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:33.500]   particularly men may enjoy anal penetration.
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:36.140]   Women as well may enjoy anal penetration
[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:39.740]   because of the innervation around there, the pelvic floor.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:43.300]   And so that's certainly reasonable to do so.
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:46.620]   As far as why people engage in anal sex,
[02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.980]   so sometimes it's because, as I mentioned,
[02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:51.220]   they're trying to avoid vaginal penetration,
[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:54.980]   either to avoid pregnancy or maybe menstruation
[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:56.740]   or other reasons.
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:00.200]   Sometimes it's because people wanna do something special
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:01.040]   with their partner.
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:02.980]   Like they feel like this is my special thing
[02:42:02.980 --> 02:42:04.660]   with this partner that I do with them.
[02:42:04.660 --> 02:42:06.980]   And so it may be something kind of like a gift
[02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:08.060]   or something like that.
[02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:12.500]   Sometimes it's almost like they feel like they have to.
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:14.100]   And this particular study that I looked at,
[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:15.460]   there's actually not a lot of studies
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.300]   on why people engage in anal sex.
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:19.620]   And this particular study that I had talked about
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:21.100]   on my channel or on my Instagram
[02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:25.740]   was talking about why they specifically recruited drug users.
[02:42:25.740 --> 02:42:28.760]   And so a lot of people had used drugs
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:30.980]   prior to engaging in anal sex.
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:32.600]   And I think that that's not ideal.
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.940]   You always wanna be kind of in the right state of mind
[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:38.320]   for consent and safety purposes.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:41.400]   And so those were kind of the common reasons.
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.060]   - What about infection
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:45.420]   not related to sexually transmitted infection?
[02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:50.220]   My presumption is there is a higher risk with anal sex
[02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:54.940]   than there is with other vaginal intercourse,
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:56.200]   oral sex, et cetera.
[02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:59.460]   But is there evidence for that?
[02:42:59.460 --> 02:43:00.640]   - Not necessarily.
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:02.620]   It's more about sexually transmitted infections
[02:43:02.620 --> 02:43:03.460]   more than anything else.
[02:43:03.460 --> 02:43:04.300]   It's rare.
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:05.620]   You can sometimes, I mean, the rare things
[02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:07.220]   that people have kind of commented on
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.220]   like anal incontinence temporarily
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:11.340]   or things like that, very rare.
[02:43:11.340 --> 02:43:14.160]   Mostly it's just sexually transmitted infections
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:16.060]   because you can't have more,
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:18.940]   it's more easy to create bleeding through anal sex
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:20.140]   if you're not careful.
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:22.000]   - And are people doing enemas before anal sex
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.540]   to prevent bacterial infection?
[02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:25.740]   Or is that just like it's a kind of-
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:27.440]   - Some people are, some people are not.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:29.180]   I think it's, people are making sure
[02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:31.100]   they're evacuated fully.
[02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:33.180]   There's some media articles
[02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:35.000]   about like what you should eat before
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.740]   to kind of keep your gut healthy
[02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:40.740]   and avoid kind of loose stools and things like that.
[02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:42.300]   But generally speaking, you know,
[02:43:42.300 --> 02:43:44.220]   there's lots of things you can look up
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:45.840]   to make it safe and healthy.
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.660]   - Yeah, and I'm sure some people are listening to this
[02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:50.740]   and they're, maybe they've turned it off already.
[02:43:50.740 --> 02:43:54.420]   But, and I think we can expect a varied response
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:58.060]   to this discussion, but it's happening out there.
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:43:58.900]   - It's happening.
[02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:00.940]   - Apparently with an increasing frequency.
[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:01.780]   - Yes.
[02:44:01.780 --> 02:44:02.820]   And I don't know if that's because
[02:44:02.820 --> 02:44:04.940]   of the increasing availability of pornography
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:07.480]   where it's visualized more or if,
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:09.580]   I don't really know why,
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:11.860]   but we do know that there's more going on
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:14.140]   in heterosexual couples than prior.
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:15.860]   - As a final category of question,
[02:44:15.860 --> 02:44:19.940]   I was really interested in some of the posts you've done
[02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:23.140]   about herbs and supplements
[02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:25.960]   in the context of sexual desire and sexual function.
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:31.100]   On this podcast, I always say, always, always,
[02:44:31.100 --> 02:44:34.020]   we emphasize behavioral tools first, do's and don'ts.
[02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:35.580]   Because those are the foundation of mental health,
[02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:39.420]   physical health and performance in all contexts.
[02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:44.860]   There is of course a role for prescription drugs sometimes.
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:46.980]   Oftentimes people can't do the things
[02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:48.560]   and avoid the certain things they want to
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:51.060]   because of depressive states, anxious states, et cetera.
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:52.720]   And prescription drugs can serve a role.
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:56.500]   But I do believe the goal is always behaviors first.
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:01.140]   Then of course, things like adequate sleep, nutrition,
[02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:05.320]   healthy social interaction, all of that stuff, exercise.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.760]   But we do often talk about supplements
[02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:11.920]   because they represent, I think, an important category
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:15.960]   of over-the-counter compounds that can play a role.
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:20.480]   And I've talked before about tonga ali, this Indonesian herb.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:22.000]   I think it can be Malaysian as well,
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.420]   but this Indonesian herb is typically the one
[02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:29.420]   that I am aware works best for mild libido enhancement.
[02:45:29.420 --> 02:45:34.380]   Sometimes, especially in the case of people taking SSRIs,
[02:45:35.380 --> 02:45:39.420]   it can enhance libido to override some of the challenges
[02:45:39.420 --> 02:45:41.880]   with SSRI induced reduction in libido.
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:44.480]   And generally, even if people aren't on SSRIs,
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:46.100]   I hear from people who take tonga ali
[02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:48.140]   and get libido increases.
[02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:50.140]   Also things like maca root,
[02:45:50.140 --> 02:45:53.900]   which we don't really know how these things work exactly.
[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:56.980]   Probably some freeing up of testosterone with tonga ali,
[02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:59.740]   maybe some cortisol suppression as well,
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:02.700]   maybe some estrogen receptor modulation with maca root,
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:05.600]   maybe some dopaminergic tone changes.
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:10.720]   Shila G, this Ayurvedic herb,
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:13.380]   which there is at least one study
[02:46:13.380 --> 02:46:18.940]   that I think has done well that shows increases in FSH,
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:22.820]   follicle stimulating hormone, with Shila G use.
[02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:25.180]   What are your thoughts on things like tonga ali,
[02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:27.220]   maca root, Shila G?
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:29.900]   How do you talk to your patients about this stuff?
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:34.600]   - Yeah, so I think that I see at least my patient population
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:38.020]   is still in the behavioral management place, right?
[02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:40.240]   The biggest cause of sexual dysfunction,
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.580]   whether it's low testosterone, erectile dysfunction,
[02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:46.980]   sexual dysfunction is often comorbidities, right?
[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:48.580]   So managing high blood pressure,
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:51.700]   managing diabetes with diet, which you talk about a lot,
[02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:54.460]   but the best studied diet is the Mediterranean diet,
[02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:57.460]   at least in the sexual dysfunction literature.
[02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:01.940]   Exercise, like doing both cardiovascular aerobic exercise,
[02:47:01.940 --> 02:47:03.580]   but also doing resistance training,
[02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:06.700]   particularly of large muscle groups.
[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:11.260]   And then really working on reducing blood pressure
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:13.180]   and preventing diabetes.
[02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:14.860]   And those things I think are really key.
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:17.220]   And I know you talk about them all on this podcast,
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:21.060]   but I will tell you that when people are getting ready for,
[02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:23.820]   for example, we do a surgery for erectile dysfunction
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:25.020]   called penile prosthesis.
[02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:27.460]   So this is like end of the line, nothing's working,
[02:47:27.460 --> 02:47:29.520]   they can't get an erection at all.
[02:47:29.520 --> 02:47:33.340]   And it can be, and they may have diabetes as a cause of it.
[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:35.900]   And when we say you have to get your hemoglobin A1c
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:38.500]   below a certain level to do surgery,
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:40.300]   I cannot tell you how quickly
[02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:42.660]   these men change their behaviors.
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:43.620]   - For sake of erections.
[02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.940]   - For sake of erections.
[02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:47.580]   So I think that really, if I can say one thing
[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:50.680]   before you do supplements, which I don't have a problem with,
[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:53.680]   I think that it's reasonable to try them.
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:56.260]   I would try one at a time to see what's working.
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:47:57.560]   So you're not taking a bunch of things
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:47:59.040]   and not knowing what exactly is working
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:01.140]   and realizing that they're not gonna work immediately.
[02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:03.360]   If you take something that works immediately,
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:06.440]   it's probably got a PDE-5 inhibitor mixed in there.
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:08.820]   And so it's gonna kind of build over time
[02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:10.860]   and you're gonna see changes over time.
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:13.180]   But I would say that the number one thing
[02:48:13.180 --> 02:48:16.480]   that I recommend for people is improving their diet,
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:18.400]   exercising, getting good sleep.
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.120]   As you know, it boosts testosterone.
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:22.420]   And even, you mentioned this all the time,
[02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:23.900]   like getting early morning light,
[02:48:23.900 --> 02:48:26.120]   but it's beneficial for testosterone as well
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:28.180]   because you're really helping release testosterone
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:29.560]   with a circadian biology.
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:32.680]   So I think that those things, I can't stress enough,
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:34.260]   like how valuable they are.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:36.260]   And if you're smoking, quit smoking.
[02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:37.860]   It will kill your erections.
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:38.700]   - And vaping.
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:39.540]   - Yeah, and vaping.
[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:40.360]   - Yeah.
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:41.200]   - And then lastly,
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:43.240]   if you are developing true organic impotence,
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:45.300]   meaning that there's a biologic problem
[02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:47.580]   that's causing your sexual dysfunction,
[02:48:47.580 --> 02:48:48.820]   then it's really important
[02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:51.100]   to get your cardiovascular health assessed
[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:55.420]   because about 15% of men who develop erectile dysfunction
[02:48:55.420 --> 02:48:58.100]   seven years later will have a cardiovascular event.
[02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:00.140]   It is the canary in the coal mine,
[02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.580]   meaning that it's a sign
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:04.380]   that you may be developing cardiovascular problems
[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:06.420]   or like endothelial dysfunction
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:08.860]   that's first presenting in the penis
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:10.260]   or in their sexual organs.
[02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:12.760]   And this probably is the same for women.
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:14.420]   We just don't have the data yet.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:18.340]   - I know a good number of women that take Tonga Ali.
[02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.460]   In part, I think on the recommendation,
[02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:21.420]   although I want to be clear,
[02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:22.260]   I never recommended it.
[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:24.620]   It was an offer of something that people could try
[02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:26.040]   if they're doing everything else correctly
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:30.060]   and could assess with consulting your physician, of course.
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:35.860]   And they too, some of them have reported improvements
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:37.940]   in libido and desire as well.
[02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:39.040]   - That makes sense, yeah.
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:41.620]   - Yeah, and the Shilaji is less known
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:44.380]   about the distinguishing quality
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:46.980]   versus low quality sources of Shilaji is harder.
[02:49:46.980 --> 02:49:47.820]   Dosing is harder.
[02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:50.620]   It comes as this tar typically.
[02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:53.040]   Maybe more science on Shilaji will come out
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:53.880]   in the next few years.
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:56.200]   We could get behind it a bit more.
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:49:58.020]   Right now, I'm sort of on the, yeah, maybe,
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:00.140]   if you are in an adventure, you might try it,
[02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:03.180]   but it's not one that I'd normally throw
[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:04.020]   to the top of the list.
[02:50:04.020 --> 02:50:07.460]   - Yeah, I think that like L-citrulline is pretty good.
[02:50:07.460 --> 02:50:09.140]   Ashwagandha for stress reduction,
[02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:11.860]   which also has implications for sexual function.
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:14.400]   Tonga Ali has reasonable data.
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.880]   I think there is reasonable data on these things.
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:18.380]   I think the website you talk about all the time,
[02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:21.560]   examine.com is a great place to look at that.
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:24.020]   And like I said, I think it's reasonable.
[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:25.120]   They're smaller studies.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.100]   They're not, there is bias in many studies,
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:31.140]   but there is effort done in this area
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:34.100]   and there's never going to be a really high quality science.
[02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:36.280]   No one's going to really fund that, I think.
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:38.420]   So I think our expectations need to be a little tempered
[02:50:38.420 --> 02:50:40.300]   when it comes to that stuff.
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:45.300]   - Well, Rina, Dr. Malik, I want to thank you ever so much
[02:50:46.100 --> 02:50:47.260]   for this discussion today.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:50.220]   You provide us so much useful information
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:53.900]   and really have transcended the divide between, you know,
[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:56.780]   the mysterious thing that everyone wants to know about sex
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:59.900]   and sexual health, genitals and genital health,
[02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:02.940]   prostate urethra, UTIs, all these topics
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:07.260]   that many people are just afraid to raise
[02:51:07.260 --> 02:51:09.080]   and to confront directly.
[02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:12.040]   And you've taught us so much about how to promote the health
[02:51:12.040 --> 02:51:14.180]   of this incredibly important system.
[02:51:14.180 --> 02:51:17.140]   One thing we know for sure, either in vivo or in a dish,
[02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:19.180]   we're all here because of sperm and an egg.
[02:51:19.180 --> 02:51:22.100]   And of course there are other reasons
[02:51:22.100 --> 02:51:23.660]   why people engage in sexual activity
[02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:25.660]   that have nothing to do with reproduction,
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:28.780]   but surely it is core to our biology
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:31.120]   and our psychology and wellbeing.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:32.500]   So thank you so much.
[02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:35.660]   And also thank you for the work you do day in and day out,
[02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:38.560]   week in and week out in your clinic.
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:41.000]   We will provide links to your clinic.
[02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.140]   People are interested in working with you directly
[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:44.660]   as well as online.
[02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:46.020]   That's how I initially found you.
[02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:48.700]   And when I did, I was just absolutely delighted.
[02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:50.960]   I thought, finally, there's somebody who's providing
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:53.380]   the kind of information that everybody wants
[02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:58.380]   in a thoughtful, logical, clear and respectful way.
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:01.540]   So on behalf of all the listeners and viewers
[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:04.400]   and on behalf of myself, I just want to say,
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:06.160]   thank you, thank you, thank you for what you do
[02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:08.700]   and please keep going and please come back.
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:09.580]   - Thank you so much.
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:11.900]   And honestly, the work you do is phenomenal.
[02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:12.860]   It's an honor to be here.
[02:52:12.860 --> 02:52:14.580]   Thank you so much.
[02:52:14.580 --> 02:52:16.320]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:55.500]   Not on today's podcast, but on many previous episodes
[02:52:55.500 --> 02:52:58.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:00.180]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:02.320]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:53:02.320 --> 02:53:05.760]   for things like improving sleep, hormone support and focus.
[02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:07.540]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[02:53:07.540 --> 02:53:08.700]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:53:08.700 --> 02:53:10.420]   If you'd like to access the supplements discussed

[02:53:34.980 --> 02:53:37.540]   That is short PDFs describing, for instance,
[02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:41.060]   tools to improve sleep, tools to improve neuroplasticity.
[02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:43.880]   We talk about deliberate cold exposure, fitness,
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:45.140]   various aspects of mental health.
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.820]   Again, all completely zero cost.

[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:57.820]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:53:57.820 --> 02:54:00.260]   I am @hubermanlab on all platforms.
[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:04.220]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, Threads, LinkedIn and Facebook.
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:05.820]   And at all of those places,
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.820]   I talk about science and science related tools,
[02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:09.380]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:10.480]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:12.700]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:54:12.700 --> 02:54:13.900]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:17.020]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:19.420]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:20.820]   with Dr. Rino Malek.
[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:22.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:24.680]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:27.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:29.840]   (upbeat music)
