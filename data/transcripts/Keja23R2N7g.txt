[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.100]   Okay, so I wanted to introduce somebody. This is an incredible story of a turnaround of a business
[00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.940]   that impacts a lot of us in America, if you care about climate change, etc. His name is Jim
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.020]   Latinsky, and here's a guy who had all the success in the world running a hedge fund successfully.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.980]   A business called Mollicorp goes into bankruptcy. He basically puts his entire fund in it,
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.460]   brings it out of bankruptcy, manages to build one of the first mines that was completely cleared.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.640]   You heard what Elon said about California in California, that mines some of these rare
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.760]   earths and critical metals that we need to make permanent magnets that we use in electric motors
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.840]   on the front lines of climate change, building factories now in South Carolina with GM, etc.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.220]   So Jim's just going to walk you through a few things, and we're going to talk about some climate
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.040]   change stuff after this.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:20.680]   Hey, everyone. So I'm Jim. I used to run a hedge fund, and now I'm an accidental industrialist.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.340]   So I want to take you through that journey. And then while I do that, it'll, you know, we'll go
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.660]   through the process. And then I'm going to talk to you about some of the things that I've done.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.720]   And then I'll talk to you about some of the problems that I've done.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.840]   And then I'll talk to you about some of the problems that I'd like to solve.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.560]   Just to provide some context. So I think if we think about a lot of the things that just came up
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.620]   with respect to the economy, it's been about a decade plus since the global financial crisis.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.060]   And in that decade plus, we've been in this environment where there's been essentially a full-on
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.900]   boom, a lot of money printing, and essentially a very low or negative cost of capital in growth,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.640]   in technology, right? And what we've seen is that the economy has been in a very low or negative cost
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.700]   of capital in growth, in technology, right? And so we've seen that the economy has been in a very low or negative cost of capital in growth,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.700]   and so we've seen that the economy has been in a very low or negative cost of capital in growth,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.660]   and now I guess we're on the beginning stages of the aftermath of experiencing that economic enema,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.200]   as was just discussed. But we have just been through this period of over a decade where there's been,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.940]   you know, all this money that has gone to growth. And what has happened during that time simultaneously
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:28.200]   is the real economy has been starved. You haven't seen, I doubt many of you have friends that are investing in new steel mills or aluminum mills or nickel mines,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.620]   maybe nickel mines, but you haven't seen, I doubt many of you have friends that are investing in new steel mills or aluminum mills or nickel mines,
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.680]   but you haven't seen, I doubt many of you have friends that are investing in new steel mills or nickel mines,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.780]   now, right? But while the real economy has been starved, actually, interestingly, we haven't noticed it so much,
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.700]   one, because we're just starting to scale into electrification, but China's made investments.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.840]   So pretty much all of the incremental steel and aluminum and commodities capacity in the world over the last decade
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   has come online because, you know, China has led the way. And, you know, as an aside, interestingly,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.840]   about 80% of the aluminum and 80% of the steel production in China is done with coal.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.960]   So not only has this been, you know, not only have they sort of taken over the real stuff,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.520]   and this isn't about, you know, wherever you are on the spectrum of, you know,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.220]   are they just a really tough competitor or is this, you know, some kind of economic World War III?
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.800]   It doesn't matter. What matters is, is that the incremental stuff in the real world has really,
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.040]   in a way, has been led by China. And so when we think about what's now happening in the world as we electrify,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.700]   I want to move on to the next one here.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.980]   I think one good thing about going after Elon is I don't have to really explain this chart.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:57.900]   We are electrifying. And as we electrify, what a lot of people might not fully understand is that while all this real stuff has come online,
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.400]   the Chinese have actually moved downstream very intelligently.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   And so when we think about a lot of people may have heard of China 2025,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.740]   but a lot of people probably haven't heard of China 2035,
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.260]   which is the current MO, which is to move downstream into standardization.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:25.920]   And so actually, when we look around the world today, four of the top 10 OEMs are Chinese by global battery electric share.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.540]   And so when we think about the world today,
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.860]   when we think about the single largest private employer in the country, the auto industry,
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.640]   we think about all these industries that are mineral intensive.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.360]   The Chinese are actually have moved downstream.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.860]   And these are these are very mineral intensive industries.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:50.060]   So what this slide shows is as we go from a fossil fuel world to an electrification world,
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.240]   which, you know, we all I think everyone in this room believes is is fake complete.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.520]   And this actually excludes steel and electric.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.880]   Just in the content of copper, nickel, lithium, and then what I focus on, rare earths, and
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.280]   some of these other things, there's seven times as much content.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   And so, when we think about the past of the fossil-fuel-driving geopolitical gamesmanship
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   and power in the world, the future is about minerals.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.220]   And what I focus on are rare earths.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.900]   So, and I'm going to get to my journey as an accidental industrialist in a minute, but
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.700]   what you can see here is rare earths, they're kind of, the way to think about it is sort
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.120]   of like a young cousin of semiconductors to the EV business.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.780]   So regardless of how electrification happens, regardless of battery chemistry, how that
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.920]   energy gets to a motor, that motor moves via magnets, and so this industry is expected
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   to explode.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.020]   And it's not just EVs, it's wind turbines, drones, robots.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.280]   Can anyone actually guess where this robot is from?
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.080]   This is actually from Short Circuit, Johnny #5, but I'm hoping Elon will get us a better
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.080]   robot of the future.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.500]   But when we think about all these industries, magnetics, it's really powerful.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.620]   So that's where I'm focused, and this is just an example of the commodity needs, as
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620]   we electrify.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.320]   If we take those projections of what's going to happen in electrification, just in my space,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.900]   so this is NDPR, this is the stuff that we make, the input into magnetics, you can see
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.500]   there's a huge deficit that is looming.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.680]   And just moving on, look at my space, here's the challenge.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.980]   So outside of us, this entire supply chain is essentially domiciled in China.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.320]   And it doesn't even have to be nefarious.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.420]   But what happens when the largest manufacturers in the world are all competing for what I
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.120]   showed you on that prior slide, a shortage of supply, and we've seen lots of headlines,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.700]   whether it's the semiconductor issue, or just today there was a headline that Rivian
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.840]   is fighting with a supplier over seat costs.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.080]   All of these things where we're seeing the shortages in the supply chain that are flowing
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.020]   through, if there's an allocation of materials, and the materials are controlled, then we
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.100]   don't have to worry about what's happening in the supply chain.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.320]   So what happens when the supply chain is being dominated by China, or another geopolitical
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.940]   rival, which downstream businesses do we think are going to get those materials?
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.080]   And this is actually now an existential issue for all of us.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.280]   So back to my story.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.280]   So this is Mountain Pass.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.700]   This is the mine Chamath mentioned that we bought this out of bankruptcy in my fund.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.620]   So going back about five years ago, this site went bankrupt.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.620]   It was a public company.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.720]   It sort of rose.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.780]   And then it fell.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.480]   And nobody believed that we could compete against China.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.740]   And in fact, I had to-- we showed up.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.100]   I showed up in the Delaware courthouse steps.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.600]   I mean, it was literally like out of a movie.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.940]   There were other creditors pushing to send this thing into bankruptcy.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.280]   And you look at this thing, and you're like, wait, this is one of the most valuable rare
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.500]   earth materials mines in the world.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.680]   And this is the future.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   This is a material for electrification.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   And no one wants it.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.420]   Not only does no one want it.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.060]   This is a material for the future.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.440]   And we're not going to be able to do anything about it.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.160]   And so we were like, we're going to do this.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.360]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.520]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.740]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.960]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.260]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.300]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.540]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.660]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.540]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.620]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.120]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.220]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.600]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.620]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.540]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.800]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.820]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.200]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.960]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.160]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.360]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.500]   And we're going to do this.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.580]   And we're going to do this.

[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:44.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:24.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.580]   And we're going to do this.

[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.580]   And we're going to do this.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.280]   So I think you actually said it perfectly well in the lead-in, which is just anything
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.240]   that is real stuff.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.580]   And so yeah, all of it, lithium, copper, nickel, steel, aluminum, all of these areas that have
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.080]   been starved, the cost of capital is just so high across the board that if you can come
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.540]   up with solutions to deliver the shortages, and again, I'm not saying the next three months
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.020]   we could have a brutal recession for six months, but we see the long-term five, 10-year trend.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.580]   I think anywhere you look in this.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.200]   In this space, you're looking in the right direction.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.580]   It's a wind at your back as opposed to, and again, I'm not taking a view, but to come
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.600]   up with a new cryptocurrency right now.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.840]   It's a huge wind at your back relative to a headwind.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.900]   Could you get your mind operational in today's political environment, do you think?
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:15.860]   Like if you had to start from scratch or if you found a new thing in Nevada or wherever
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.980]   it is?
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   That's a great question.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.580]   And that's the challenge is that it takes, to get any of these things, it takes a decade.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.440]   It takes, if you have all of the capital in place, all of the human capital, all that,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.220]   just the going through that process to build it, the materials cost.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.660]   And so could I do it?
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.060]   I think the world needs it.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.880]   And I think that what we do environmentally is so unique that I think we could get it
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   done.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.880]   But this is a big challenge.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.340]   And I think frankly, it's a, you guys were talking in the last session about we need
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.420]   to come together.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.760]   This is a big time area where we need to come together.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.240]   There should be a grand bargain.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.580]   There should be...
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.700]   And the panelists should say, "Okay, I accept that we need this stuff.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.520]   I accept that we don't want it to be only made in Russia and China."
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.640]   And they should loosen up on some of the permitting stuff.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.040]   And I think the people who are just like, "Drill, drill, drill, mine, mine, mine, don't
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.980]   care," need to accept that we need to have really tough standards.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.200]   And I think we should have some kind of grand bargain and it could be tax policy focused
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   on it.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.840]   But there needs to be some kind of coming together in our country to recognize that
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   we need this stuff.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.580]   I mean, let's be intentional.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.820]   Let's be intellectually honest.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.900]   People are hypocrites.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.720]   The people in the EU, people in the United States, they want the energy.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   They want it cheap.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:36.560]   They're complaining about the expense of even a modest increase in energy costs, 10%, 20%,
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.020]   which they could withstand.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.760]   They will complain about it and they will not allow fracking in their country, but they're
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   more than willing to let Russia frack for it.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.820]   They don't want the cobalt coming out of the ground in California.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.580]   They're more than willing to let 15 year olds deal with it.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.820]   They get out of the ground without a mess.
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.820]   Eight year olds.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.760]   Eight year olds, as horrific as it is.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.500]   And there is intellectually dishonest, it's hypocrisy.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.340]   And I think we have to own the fact that we want to live in large houses and we want to
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.800]   blow the air conditioner on some ridiculous setting.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.520]   America's homes are three times bigger than other homes.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.020]   So to build on this, two very quick stories.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.720]   There's a massive deposit of lithium in Nevada, which would be enough to basically feed Tesla
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.580]   and another OEM.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.580]   Okay?
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.580]   So this would get...
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.120]   This would get probably somewhere between one and one and a half million cars, pure
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.460]   electric on the road by 2030.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:35.060]   And they were completely permitted by the BLM, the Bureau of Land Management.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.840]   And there was a lawsuit that was filed and it's still wrangling its way through the federal
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.160]   court system.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:47.640]   And what it is, is a claim that there is an upper wood grouse that could be endangered
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.900]   through this mining.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.580]   They have yet to find an actual upper wood grouse in the...
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.580]   In the area.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.580]   Right.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.580]   But nothing can happen.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   Theoretically.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.020]   And so the problem is that we've now delayed two years.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.240]   It could get resolved this year, but it could be another two or three years, which means
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.160]   the lithium isn't actually available until 2030.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.020]   I mean, while global warming continues to happen.
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.020]   That's one story.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:13.360]   Second story is that just yesterday, the California, the city of Costa Mesa rejected a bid to build
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:20.320]   an electrolysis facility to create a hundred million liters of clean water every single
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.580]   day.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.920]   Just a desal plant.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.340]   The desal plant.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.340]   Because they didn't want it.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.340]   Because they're going to lose some jellyfish or something.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.580]   No, they just didn't want it.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.940]   They thought, ah, it's unsightly.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.940]   I don't want this in Costa Mesa.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.940]   Costa Mesa is pretty.
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.940]   And meanwhile, we're in a huge drought.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.940]   It's a Costa, it's a Mesa.
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   So, you know.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.440]   And so to your point, when the rubber meets the road, these unfortunate decisions get
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.480]   made and there's no way to, you know, sort of calm top down.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.900]   These people want to take 30 minute showers.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.260]   I mean, that's the hypocrisy of it.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.580]   If Americans really want to talk about conservation...
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.580]   First of all, 30 minute, there's nothing wrong with a 30 minute shower.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.700]   Listen, I wasn't calling you out specifically, but since you unclothed yourself, it's gratuitous,
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.700]   in fact.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.700]   It's completely gratuitous.
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.700]   And it's such a great point.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.260]   And my entire argument is that we're going to, we will answer this question as a country
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.040]   either now or later.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.300]   And the point about four of the 10 largest auto OEMs in the world are now Chinese companies.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.060]   And so this is now a competitive issue.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.580]   And so we can, we can keep kicking the can or we'll face a crisis.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.580]   Are you, are you beloved by the government?
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.220]   Are you beloved by like, can you kind of like beeline and just cut through the nonsense
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.460]   because of Nevada government looks like you?
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.720]   Well, I think, I think that it's fair to say that the local officials are very happy with
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.300]   what we've done with what we've achieved in South Carolina, right?
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.520]   In Fort Worth, Texas, the magnetics facility, you know, we have some partnerships with DOD,
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.780]   the president announced those GM facilities, the GM things in Texas, Texas, Texas.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:51.580]   So I think that there is frankly support from both sides of the aisle for what we're doing.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.280]   I think that we're doing a lot of work on the executive orders on the rare earth magnetics
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.800]   industry specifically, both in the Trump administration and in the Biden administration.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.480]   So I think what we're doing is hopefully nonpartisan.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:05.260]   And frankly, I think all of this should be, and that's, you know, the point about the
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:11.440]   grand bargain, but even you raise a great point about just all of this stuff that it's,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.280]   you know, there's so much pushback and we need to, we need to figure out a way to get
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.580]   past that because this stuff has to, has to get made.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:17.960]   I think it's incredible what you're doing.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.380]   I mean, I'm a huge fan disclaimer.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.580]   I was also an investment.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.800]   I am not an investment company, but we do appreciate you giving us the education and
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.880]   we do need to be independent from communist countries and really have the supply chain
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.000]   situation dialed in.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.580]   So we appreciate the hard work for America and for freedom.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   And I'm a huge fan of you guys.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.580]   So thank you.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.580]   Thank you.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.580]   Well done.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.580]   We'll let your winners ride.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.580]   Rain man, David Sacks.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.580]   And instead we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.580]   We're going to let you ride.
