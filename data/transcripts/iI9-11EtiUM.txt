[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   Shane, a listener to the podcast, writes us to ask this.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.520]   "Pastor John, with the growing popularity of Christian satire, for example, websites
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.920]   like the Babylon Bee, what are your thoughts on the use of satire to communicate Christian
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   thought?"
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.080]   The dictionary defines satire like this.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:34.160]   The use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like in exposing, denouncing, or deriding,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.840]   vice, folly, et cetera.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.080]   And then if you look for a definition of irony, which is used to define satire, the definition
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.760]   it gives is this.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:55.040]   The use of words to convey a meaning that is the opposite of its literal meaning.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:06.840]   So satire then is a way of exposing folly, foolishness, or error, or evil by saying the
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.120]   opposite of what the author really thinks in such a way that while claiming to support
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   something, it makes it look ludicrous and therefore undermines the attitude or the activity.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.800]   Now, in deciding on whether it is wise to use satire or irony, we should ask, does the
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640]   Bible use it in a way that commends it?
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.040]   And if so, when might it be appropriate and when not?
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.600]   And are there other biblical exhortations that would put the brakes on it or guide it,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.240]   minimize it, maximize it?
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.960]   So the answer to that first question is Job, the prophets, Jesus, Paul, they all used satire.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.160]   They all used irony to expose the folly of the people they were dealing with.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.220]   For example, Job 12.2, "Truly then, you are the people and with you wisdom will die."
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.680]   That's exactly the opposite of what he thought.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.600]   Or Isaiah 44.14, this one is really, really good.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.300]   The idolater cuts down cedars and he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.800]   strong among the trees of the forest.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.140]   He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.260]   Then it becomes fuel for a man.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.420]   He takes a part of it and warms himself.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.660]   He kindles a fire and bakes bread.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.720]   Also he makes a god and worships it.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.040]   He makes an idol and falls down before it.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   Half of it he burns in the fire.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.000]   Over the half he eats meat.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.820]   He roasts it and is satisfied.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.740]   So he warms himself and says, "Aha, I am warm.
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.480]   I have seen the fire."
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.060]   And the rest of it he turns into a god.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.700]   His idol and falls down in front of it and worships it.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.460]   He prays to it and says, "Deliver me.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.500]   You are my god."
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.340]   That's really powerful.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:30.180]   And then Elijah, "And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Oh, cry aloud to your god.'"
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.340]   Either he's musing or he's going to the bathroom or he's on a journey or perhaps he's asleep
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220]   and must be awakened.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.860]   That's just pure irony and satire and sarcasm in his case.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.540]   And Jesus says to the scribes and Pharisees when they saw him eating with sinners and
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.780]   tax collectors, he said, they said, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.500]   And Jesus heard it and said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   who are sick."
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.220]   "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners," which was a very pointed indictment of those
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.000]   who were talking to him thinking they were well when they were in fact sick.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.980]   And then Paul in 1 Corinthians 4, 8, he says, "Already you have all you want.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.580]   Already you have become rich.
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.660]   Without us, you have become kings.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.580]   And would that you did reign so that we might reign with you."
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.100]   Just saying the exact opposite of what he thinks because that's what irony does.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.740]   It's not lying because the assumption is everybody knows exactly what I'm doing and they're being
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.780]   indicted by it.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.660]   Now, in all of those cases, as I look at them, the people who are being exposed by the irony
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.900]   are those who are acting wrongfully in a fairly entrenched way.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:13.460]   In other words, these are not poor, weak people who have simply stumbled and made a rare mistake,
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.860]   but are hardened people who go on and on in their error, do not respond to exhortation,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:31.460]   which means, I think, that satire and irony are not going to be a Christian's first or
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.660]   main strategy of correction with people.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.660]   Not people we're trying to win anyway.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:50.260]   We know that Jesus said not to cast our pearls before swine, but we should be very careful
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.140]   before we put someone in the category of swine.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.940]   We'll be very slow.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.860]   Similarly, we should be careful before we pull out our sword of satire when dealing
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.620]   with someone's error.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.740]   One of the difficulties with satire, and I just say this about myself in particular,
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.940]   one of the difficulties with satire is that it is so difficult to use without sounding
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   arrogant.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.240]   James Denny said, "It's very hard to show that Christ is magnificent and that I'm clever
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.140]   at the same time."
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.140]   It's been a very powerful word for me over the years.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:42.740]   Some of us are so prone to be clever and biting in our criticism that satire fits our natural
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.020]   sinfulness way too easily.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.340]   I would put myself in that category.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:56.900]   For myself, I find I need to read other sets of scriptures, other passages more often,
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.900]   like these.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:05.860]   2 Timothy 2.24, "The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.740]   to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness."
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:22.100]   Or James 3.17, "The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.700]   full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere, and a harvest of righteousness is
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.620]   sown in peace by those who make peace."
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:40.580]   Or 1 Peter 3.8, "Finally, all of you have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.460]   tender heart, a humble mind."
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:51.620]   So that's what John Piper needs to hear over and over again, because I am wired to be sarcastic.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:08:00.020]   I daydream about how to say things with pointed, ruthless effect.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.260]   So I need those verses all the time.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:10.180]   So my conclusion is that in the rough and tumble of truth speaking in a world of evil
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.740]   and folly, there will always be a place for irony and satire to do its work of exposing
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.180]   error and evil and folly.
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.500]   Nevertheless, I think the use of it is very limited in bearing the kind of fruit that
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.460]   love longs to see in transformed lives.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:36.860]   God grants repentance, it seems to me, and I base this on 2 Timothy 2.25, God grants
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:44.620]   repentance more often in connection with brokenhearted appeals rather than clever indictments.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.700]   That's a good word for all of us, and thank you for the question, Shane.

[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.660]   Well does the Bible call for musical worship or not?
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.140]   And does it call for musical worship leaders on Sundays?
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.180]   These are questions from a worship leader and it's coming up on Friday.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.460]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
