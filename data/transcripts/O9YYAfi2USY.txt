[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700]   It is very important to think in probabilities and not absolutes, so you don't miss out on opportunities.
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.440]   Think about if you had to feel you needed 100% certainty to make a decision, how many opportunities would pass you by?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.740]   Whether it's job opportunities, whether it's the girl or boy that you like that you were too afraid to ask out because you were afraid of rejection.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.200]   It's such a shame to have to think in 100% probability.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:36.740]   And so my idea is to create a 70/30 decision-making framework, which states if you believe with a 70% probability or greater your decision is the correct one,
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:45.940]   the right one, then go with it with 100% conviction while having the humility, knowing that 30% of the time, hopefully less, you'll get it wrong.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.200]   And so long as you don't die or something catastrophic happens, you're going to learn from your mistakes and get better over time.
