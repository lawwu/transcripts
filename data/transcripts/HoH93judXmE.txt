[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020]   given to studies of mental health,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.940]   physical health, and human performance.

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.720]   So without further ado,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.000]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.980]   The first question is about kratom.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.060]   And the question is,
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.700]   what are the short and long-term effects of taking kratom?
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.500]   For those of you that haven't heard of kratom,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.060]   kratom is a substance that comes from a tree
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300]   that grows naturally in Indonesia.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.980]   The tree itself is called Mitragyna speciosa.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.860]   And it's been known for hundreds of years or more,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.340]   we don't really know how long,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.220]   but at least for a couple of hundred years,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   that when people chew the leaves of this tree,
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.640]   they experience a mild stimulant effect.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.380]   And there's also a process of extraction
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.940]   whereby you can take the leaves
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.700]   and get high concentrations of kratom
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.400]   that nowadays is packaged into various supplements,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520]   most often consumed in capsule form,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.820]   although sometimes it's sold in raw powder form.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200]   Here's the key thing to understand about kratom.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.900]   Indeed, at low dosages, kratom has a mild stimulant effect.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.140]   However, at higher dosages,
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.340]   it has what's called an analgesic effect,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.740]   that is a pain killing effect,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.060]   and it acts as a sedative.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.860]   And kratom itself acts as an opioid in the body.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.100]   This is what's making kratom
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.540]   a very controversial topic these days.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.220]   In particular, because most people have heard
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.740]   of the so-called opioid crisis,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.160]   the opioid crisis has been a term coined
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   to largely center around issues
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.220]   that have taken place in the United States,
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.660]   although these issues definitely extend
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.340]   beyond the borders of the United States.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.020]   But the opioid crisis is essentially the overconsumption
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.240]   and widespread addiction to opioids.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.820]   Opioids include things like morphine, oxycodone,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.460]   also called oxycontin,
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.460]   and there are other opioids similar to those compounds,
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.240]   all of which have the general effect
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.740]   of being painkillers and sedatives.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.260]   And in some people, again,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.900]   some people eliciting a sense of euphoria,
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.340]   in particular at low to moderate dosages.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.780]   However, people quickly develop a tolerance to those drugs
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.000]   and need to consume more and more of them
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.500]   in order to get the effect that they initially got
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.860]   from a lower dosage.
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.180]   And they are not just highly habit forming,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.500]   they are highly addictive.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.700]   And we can distinguish between habit forming and addictive
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.060]   by simply saying that addictive means
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.220]   people will continue to take something
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.520]   or do something despite negative consequences.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.980]   There are other relevant definitions of addiction as well.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.700]   I define addiction more broadly
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.980]   as the progressive narrowing
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.300]   of the things that give you pleasure.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.380]   And indeed, when people get addicted to opioids,
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.540]   it is a very bad picture.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.340]   It often hampers many, many areas of their lives
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.140]   and seriously so.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.300]   So the opioid crisis refers to the overprescription
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.000]   of opioid drugs.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.060]   That's sort of what it's generally taken to mean,
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.680]   but it also includes accessing opioids
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.340]   such as morphine, oxycodone, et cetera,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.860]   through gray market sources,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.920]   through black market sources, and on and on.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.120]   And of course, the acquisition of the drugs
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.100]   is just one piece.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.900]   It's also the overconsumption of those drugs.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.440]   And of course, the addiction to those drugs,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.740]   which has proved to be so pernicious.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.380]   So what does this have to do with kratom?
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.620]   Kratom is also an opioid,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.720]   and we'll talk about how it differs
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.140]   in its opioid properties from the drugs I just talked about
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.180]   because it is different from morphine and hydrocodone,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.060]   but it also has some similar properties as well.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.460]   But the deal with kratom is that
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.420]   a good number of people out there
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.540]   have managed to wean themselves off opioids
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.580]   such as morphine and hydrocodone
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.700]   through the use of kratom.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.220]   And that has been used as justification
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.660]   for keeping kratom on the market and keeping it legal.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.100]   However, and this is a very important however,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.720]   kratom itself has also proved to be
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.880]   not only habit forming, but addictive,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.120]   especially when taken at dosages
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440]   that exceed that lower dose
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.920]   that just generally creates a bit of stimulant,
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.660]   a little bit of euphoric effect.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.280]   When people start taking higher dosages of kratom,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.000]   it is very clear that it does become addictive
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.780]   and itself is very hard to come off of,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.260]   so much so that people experience
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.860]   so-called kratom withdrawal.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.600]   Now, the reason I mentioned that kratom has been used
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.940]   by a good number of people to wean themselves off of
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.800]   the more potent forms of prescription opioids
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.420]   is that when I solicited for questions about kratom
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.680]   on social media, it was a very binary response.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.180]   In fact, there was one camp,
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.280]   a very rabid camp that said kratom is terrible,
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.840]   I took this stuff, I got addicted,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.700]   it was extremely hard to come off of.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.700]   There were additional comments in there
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.480]   such as I know somebody who literally had to go to rehab
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.320]   because of kratom, who developed a bunch of other addictions
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.000]   because of kratom, essentially many, many responses
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.600]   of people who had only bad experiences with kratom,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.900]   meaning they liked it enough at first
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.540]   that they continued to take it
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.300]   and it became addictive for them
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.740]   or somebody that they know.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.300]   However, there was another camp that was equally vocal,
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.900]   which kept saying, no, if one really adheres
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.340]   to the lower dosages of kratom,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.180]   kratom itself can be a useful tool
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.860]   for getting off other opioids.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.180]   And there were even a few bona fide medical professionals,
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.040]   medical doctors that is, and I happen to know them
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.860]   and their reputations is quite good,
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.320]   who chimed in and sort of reconciled the two camps
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.740]   by saying, indeed, if one can avoid taking kratom at all,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.720]   you should.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   There is no reason to take this thing
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.280]   thinking that it's quote unquote good for you.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.300]   You would be wise to avoid taking it
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.860]   because there is a high probability
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.940]   if you take it at a given dosage
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.320]   or at a dosage that is going to get your brain and body
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.820]   into a state of euphoria, analgesia,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.880]   and that sort of classic opioid effect
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.180]   that it's going to become habit forming or addicting for you.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.260]   That said, these same medical professionals acknowledged
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.060]   that a fair number of people that they knew
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.560]   managed to get off of the more potent forms of opioids,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.200]   such as morphine, oxycodone, and so forth, using kratom.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.560]   And they said, well, if it's a choice
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.800]   between being addicted to morphine and hydrocodone
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.540]   versus taking kratom and addicted to those substances,
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.140]   and kratom somehow allowed them
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.380]   to taper off of those substances,
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.560]   that they would look more favorably upon kratom
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.160]   if and only if they would also commit
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.260]   to progressively lowering their dose of kratom
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.340]   and eventually coming off of kratom.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.320]   So the general takeaway from all of that
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   is if you can avoid taking kratom,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.660]   meaning if you haven't taken it already, don't.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.800]   And that reminds me of a very important point,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.860]   which a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.880]   Dr. Robert Merlanka, who's a MD and PhDs,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.900]   my colleague at Stanford School of Medicine,
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.640]   is a world expert on the mechanisms underlying addiction
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.840]   and dopamine and drug reinforcement,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.700]   among many other things.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.360]   What he said on the podcast is absolutely true,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.980]   which is that it is impossible to get addicted
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.480]   to a substance that you've never consumed.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.560]   That might seem obvious, but think about that one again.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.600]   It is impossible to get addicted
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.820]   to a substance that you've never consumed.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.320]   So I think the safest statement to make
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   is if you have not tried kratom,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.940]   you would be wise to avoid it
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.280]   because you stand a chance to become addicted to it.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.040]   If, however, you are somebody that's addicted
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.400]   to other forms of opioids,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.960]   you absolutely should talk to your physician about that
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.900]   and how to get off of those opioids.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.560]   But there is evidence that some people have used kratom
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   to successfully wean themselves off
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.060]   the more potent forms of opioids that I talked about,
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.160]   namely morphine and hydrocodone, as well as a few others.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.300]   Now, if you're somebody who already takes kratom,
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.760]   you need to be very thoughtful
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   about the dosage that you take.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.280]   And you also need to be thoughtful about the fact
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.120]   that people differ dramatically in their response to opioids.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.920]   This is oh so important and people do not talk
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.120]   about this enough.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.760]   We hear, for instance, that, oh, you know,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.440]   if people are taking anywhere from one to five grams,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.000]   maybe one to six grams of kratom per day,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.120]   that's keeping it in the dosage range
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.160]   for which people don't generally tend to get addicted.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.300]   You'll hear things like that.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.980]   And by the way, when I say one to five
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.880]   or one to six grams per day,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.120]   I'm not talking about the individual compounds
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.560]   that are present in kratom.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.380]   There are a couple of different plant alkaloids
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.560]   I'll talk about in a moment that are present in kratom,
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.200]   and these have different effects on the opioid system.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.640]   So nowadays, some of the companies that sell kratom,
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.200]   and by the way, this is sold over the counter
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.040]   as a supplement.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.200]   It does not require a prescription to purchase,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.320]   at least at this point in time in the United States.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.480]   Some of these products will have a higher concentration
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.260]   of one or the other alkaloids within them,
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.560]   such that you can't really compare one gram
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.280]   of one brand of kratom to one gram of another brand
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   of kratom because they can have wildly different levels
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.820]   of these different alkaloids, and these different alkaloids
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.240]   have wildly different impact on different aspects
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.660]   of your brain and body biology.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.100]   In particular, how much they tend to impact
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.700]   the so-called endogenous opioid system.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.320]   Okay, so when we talk about dosages,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.920]   we have to keep this in the back of our mind,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.260]   and we have to keep in the back of our mind
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.440]   that there does seem to be a subgroup of people.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.640]   We don't know how big this subgroup of people is,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.600]   but we know it's not everyone,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.300]   but it's somewhere between 10 and 40% of people
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.040]   seem to respond to opioids in a particularly potent way.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.280]   They really like them, and perhaps not surprisingly,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.360]   people outside of that category don't tend to like opioids.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.960]   I can certainly say that I am somebody who,
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.440]   when I've been prescribed things like Vicodin
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.200]   or any other opioid post-surgery for pain,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.880]   I hate taking those drugs.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.080]   I absolutely hate it.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.520]   I'd rather deal with the pain.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.880]   They make me nauseous, they make me feel terrible.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.680]   That said, I know people who love opioids.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.760]   It's like a natural fit for their chemistry
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   in the sense that it tends to evoke more euphoria.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.340]   They just immediately like the feeling.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.800]   Some of you may remember the episode
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.560]   of the Huberman Lab podcast that I did about alcohol,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.760]   and there too, I discussed the fact
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.040]   that about eight to 10% of people who consume alcohol
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.160]   get an increased dopamine response to alcohol
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.200]   that's not observed in other people,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.800]   and that particular subgroup of people is very,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.520]   very at risk for developing alcohol use disorder,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.800]   sometimes called alcoholism, because they can drink in a way
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.280]   and they experience a high from drinking in a way
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.240]   that other people simply do not experience.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.160]   Now, like everybody else,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.440]   if they consume too much alcohol, they get drunk,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.360]   so it's not about the drunk effect.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.440]   It's about the dopamine and other sorts of chemicals
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.820]   that are released in those people in response to alcohol
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.480]   that other people just don't seem to experience
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.980]   at the same level of potency.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.980]   So again, with things like kratom and the other opioids,
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:04.820]   there's a category of people,
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.840]   and it's a much larger category of people.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.440]   Again, 10 to 40%, we don't know exactly how many
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.700]   because the studies are not really completed
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.120]   and there aren't enough of those studies yet, unfortunately,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.960]   but when those people take an opioid, wow, oh wow,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   do they like it, and those people in particular
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.400]   are very much at risk for developing an addiction
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.240]   to opioids, and so those people especially
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.320]   should never ever go near kratom if they haven't,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.440]   or if they are already taking kratom,
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.760]   these are the people that are constantly ratcheting up
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.100]   their dose, these are the people that tell you,
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.120]   no, I'm not addicted, but if you were to say,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.980]   hey, all right, well then let's do an experiment
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.060]   where you don't take kratom for a week.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.220]   Those are going to be the people that are suddenly going
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.540]   to get anxious about the mere idea of that.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.000]   I've also talked about this in reference to cannabis
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.040]   when I did an episode about cannabis.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   Again, I'm not putting a blanket statement out there
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.680]   about cannabis as being good or bad on that episode.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.760]   I talked about the fact that cannabis does indeed
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.760]   have various therapeutic uses, but that there are a good
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.680]   number of people who rely on cannabis for anxiety control
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.720]   and other ways of modulating their brain chemistry
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.920]   and bodily chemistry such that if you were to say,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.320]   hey, are you addicted to cannabis?
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.020]   They'd say, no, I don't have to smoke cannabis,
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.820]   I don't have to take my edibles, but if you were to push
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.160]   them a little bit and say, all right, well then,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.600]   let's do an experiment where you don't consume any cannabis
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.860]   in any form for 10 days.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.440]   They don't like the idea of that experiment at all.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.960]   So much so that were they to run that experiment,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.160]   they would experience a lot of the withdrawal symptoms
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.800]   associated with addiction.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.720]   So I can't in good faith say that kratom is safe
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.920]   for everybody because it is simply not.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.560]   Now, is it safer than the other opioids?
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.880]   And if so, why?
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.220]   Well, in order to address that, let's take a short glance
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.440]   at the pharmacology of kratom and how it works in terms
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.040]   of its neurochemistry in the body.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.200]   And I'm going to keep this pretty brief
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.640]   because in the future, I'm going to do an extended episode
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.120]   all about opioids and I will include kratom
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.440]   in that conversation.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.880]   But just to back up a little bit and discuss
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.160]   what opioids are, opioids are compounds that can activate
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.600]   the so-called endogenous opioid system.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.120]   All of us have within our brain and body,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.560]   the capacity to release our own opioids.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.880]   That's right, you have opioids within your body,
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.160]   they are released from neurons and they bind
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.520]   to so-called opioid receptors.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.440]   Perhaps some of you have heard
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.140]   of the so-called runner's high.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.000]   The runner's high is a euphoric state.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.360]   It's a fairly mild euphoric state in most cases,
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   but it's a euphoric state induced by long duration effort,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.880]   AKA the runner's high.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.480]   The runner's high is just a phrase used to explain
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.980]   that when we engage in long duration,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.460]   repetitive action effort,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.120]   the body starts releasing these endogenous opioids,
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.240]   they bind to receptors and they trigger things
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.780]   like analgesia, relief from pain.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.500]   They trigger mild euphoria.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.560]   They tend to change our perception of the outside world,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.980]   make things look more beautiful, shiny.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.080]   They give things a little bit of a sheen.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.680]   What I just described is a mild version
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.760]   of what people experience
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.640]   when they take something like morphine.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.620]   When people take morphine,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.440]   there's a more of a sedative effect,
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.360]   there's more of a euphoric effect,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.840]   and there's more of a dreamlike effect.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.440]   And again, it will depend on dosage.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.280]   Kratom and morphine and hydrocodone all have the property
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.100]   of acting like the endogenous opioids,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.740]   but at much higher potency.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.400]   When you bring them into your system,
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.040]   they cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.420]   so they go into the brain,
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.220]   and they bind to a number of different opioid receptors.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.660]   There's the mu opioid receptor.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.820]   By the way, these names all follow Greek alphabet letters.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.820]   So the mu opioid receptor, the kappa opioid receptor,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.060]   there are a bunch of different ones.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.020]   Kratom binds preferentially to the mu opioid receptor
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.500]   and somewhat to the kappa opioid receptor.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.740]   There's a big misconception out there.
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:52.580]   A lot of people,
[00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.740]   especially people who are proponents of kratom,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.740]   will say no, morphine and hydrocodone
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   bind the mu opioid receptor,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.000]   whereas kratom binds the kappa opioid receptor,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.820]   so it's a different compound, very, very different.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.680]   Not true, not true.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.280]   Kratom, morphine, and hydrocodone
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.860]   all bind to the mu opioid receptor,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.880]   and that's what's largely responsible
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.620]   for its opioid-like effects,
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.560]   especially when you get the dosage up to a level
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.420]   where you start getting the mild sedation,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.920]   the analgesia, the pain relief.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.600]   And keep in mind, a lot of people are taking kratom
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.620]   because they want pain relief.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.740]   And when that mu opioid receptor system is activated,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.340]   it indirectly activates
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.300]   a lot of the reinforcement circuitry in the brain
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.520]   that relates to dopamine and serotonin.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.460]   This is another area
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.360]   that we'll go into in more depth in the future,
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.540]   but there's been a lot of controversy.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.140]   People saying, oh, kratom doesn't trigger
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.420]   the dopamine system, therefore it's not addictive.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.420]   But that is simply not true.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.700]   It indirectly activates the reinforcement circuitry
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.100]   that includes both dopamine and serotonin,
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.100]   but its primary effect
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.820]   is to hit this mu opioid receptor system
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.900]   that exists in a bunch of places in the brain,
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.020]   but mainly in the brainstem
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.280]   and a structure called the periaqueductal gray nucleus,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.700]   which then provides pain relief.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.780]   It triggers a number of different shifts in cognition.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.260]   It's what creates that mild euphoria, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.360]   Now, how can we be so confident
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.300]   that kratom is acting so similarly to hydrocodone
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.400]   and to morphine, albeit with lower potency?
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.440]   And the reason is if you give people a drug
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.340]   that blocks the mu opioid receptor
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.100]   prior to them taking kratom,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.020]   they don't experience any of the classic effects
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.520]   of taking kratom.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.880]   No euphoria, no analgesia, no sedation,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.500]   even at the low dosages, no mild stimulant effect.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.700]   So we really have to look at kratom as an opioid, okay?
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.900]   That's just the honest truth.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.580]   And if you're somebody who doesn't like this message
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.460]   because you like kratom,
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.240]   I'm not telling you that you don't like kratom.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.800]   I'm telling you, you likely like kratom
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.300]   because it's an opioid.
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.540]   So again, if you go online
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.740]   and you start asking questions about kratom,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.420]   again, you're going to see these two camps.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.540]   You're going to see the kratom is terrible,
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.900]   it's addictive, it's everything bad camp.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.540]   And then you're going to see the other camp out there,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.000]   very vocal as well,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.940]   talking about how kratom helped them
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.660]   avoid other things that are worse.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.700]   And this is an argument that frankly,
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.620]   I don't think we want to lean on, right?
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.780]   The idea that substance A is not as bad as substance B
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.620]   and that making substance A unavailable
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.620]   is just going to send everyone running for substance B,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.740]   you know, that's a weak argument, frankly, right?
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.420]   I heard this argument around cannabis.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.620]   And by the way, I'm,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.240]   I think pretty balanced about cannabis.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.020]   If you listen to the episode I did on cannabis,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.060]   I think you'll agree that I believe
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.500]   that cannabis has its therapeutic applications.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.480]   I also believe that young people,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.460]   especially young males with a predisposition to psychosis
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.660]   should not be taking high concentration THC cannabis,
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.840]   because the data tell us
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.160]   they are already at risk of psychosis
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.860]   and they are at a much greater risk of psychosis if they do.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.420]   So I think I'm pretty balanced about the story on cannabis,
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.020]   but I often hear the argument,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.120]   oh, cannabis isn't as bad as alcohol
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.040]   and therefore cannabis is good.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.540]   That's simply not rational.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.620]   What we should be saying is whether or not it's cannabis
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.980]   or alcohol or kratom or any substance for that matter,
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.980]   what are the potential benefits?
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.820]   What are the potential risks?
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.760]   And again, this is far too much
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.900]   than we can go into in this AMA.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.360]   And we will go into in a future full length episode
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.820]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.980]   But the other thing to really keep in mind
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.140]   is the lack of regulation over kratom supplements.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:32.520]   Now, as many of you know, I am a fan of many, not all,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.900]   but many supplements in certain conditions.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.940]   I always say behaviors first, then nutrition,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.980]   then if and only if it's needed, rely on supplementation.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.460]   But supplementation is a big category.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.120]   But when we're talking about supplements
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.740]   that are opioid compounds, I start to get nervous
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.060]   because of the high abuse potential
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.020]   and the high addiction potential of opioids.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.180]   And kratom is included in that category.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.720]   A couple of other key notes about kratom.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.020]   While death directly from kratom is fairly rare,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.680]   it has happened.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.780]   Now, hydrocodone and morphine suppress respiration,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.400]   actually suppress breathing by way of a mechanism
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.980]   that if you're a listener of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.120]   you know about, which is the so-called physiological sigh.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.460]   Many of you have heard me talk about the physiological sigh
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.980]   as something that you do voluntarily,
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.620]   the double inhale through the nose and then a long exhale
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.140]   in order to rapidly reduce your level of stress.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.020]   As far as we know, that's the fastest way
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.980]   to deliberately lower your level of stress.
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.220]   But the physiological sigh was discovered in the 1930s
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.400]   as a spontaneous pattern of breathing
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.820]   that occurs involuntarily in sleep
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.520]   in order to reinflate the lungs and offload carbon dioxide
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.260]   and bring oxygen back into the system
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.680]   on the subsequent breath.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.400]   When I interviewed Dr. Jack Feldman,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.320]   who is a professor at University of California, Los Angeles,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.960]   and really the pioneer
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.920]   of the modern neuroscience understanding of respiration,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.960]   he talked about some studies in his laboratory
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.400]   that were exploring why people die when taking opioids.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.960]   This is a major issue associated with the opioid crisis.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.640]   And what he mentioned was that the opioids bind
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.100]   to particular receptors in the brainstem locations
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.940]   that generate physiological sighs.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.760]   So opioids, when taken as drugs,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.980]   suppress physiological sighing and do so during sleep.
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.240]   And lack of adequate respiration,
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.560]   meaning people stop breathing during sleep,
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.940]   is one of the primary reasons why people die
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.880]   when they take opioids.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.340]   Now, kratom is not known to suppress respiration
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.740]   when taken at low to moderate dosages,
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.860]   but when combined with any other opioids,
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.040]   and certainly when combined with alcohol,
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.160]   it can suppress respiration.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.940]   And while the data on this are fairly scant,
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.540]   there is some evidence that kratom-induced death
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.900]   is caused by suppression of the respiration system.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.980]   So again, death due to taking kratom
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.800]   at the dosages that are recommended
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.720]   on most commercial packaging is fairly rare,
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.660]   although it has happened.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:00.760]   It's unclear if it happened
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.300]   because it was taken in combination with other compounds.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.500]   That seems likely,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.780]   but we can't forget that a lot of people
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.340]   are taking kratom at much higher dosages,
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.320]   and in fact, progressively higher and higher dosages
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.580]   from these over-the-counter sources.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.700]   And with increased dosage,
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.660]   there is, yes, an increased risk of respiratory failure.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.160]   So again, all of this points to the fact
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.760]   that kratom is simply not a benign substance.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.020]   So if we're going to be very honest,
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.580]   the addictive potential of kratom is real.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.380]   It is exacerbated for some people compared to others,
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.820]   but it is real.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.580]   Its very similarities to other more potent forms of opioids
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.480]   are what make it attractive for some people
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.440]   who are trying to come off
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.620]   those more potent form of opioids.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.360]   But the goal, of course,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.700]   is to completely come off all opioids.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.740]   And kratom itself can be a bit of a trap.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.240]   It can be a trap in the sense
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.700]   that people who have never taken other opioids
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.640]   can become addicted to kratom itself.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.820]   That is absolutely clear.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.900]   That can happen.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.760]   It has happened in a great number of people.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.280]   It's also clear that kratom can potentially be a trap.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.780]   Notice I said potentially,
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.020]   because if people are trying to come off
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.700]   other more potent forms of opioids,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.300]   and then they use kratom to do that,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.320]   and then they're ratcheting up their dosage of kratom
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.140]   such that they're now matching the endogenous response
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.460]   to kratom in a way that doesn't really distinguish
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.080]   from the effects that they were getting
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.040]   from morphine and hydrocodone,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.380]   well, then they're just using a different form
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.900]   of morphine and hydrocodone.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.180]   And I'm sure that some of you are out there saying,
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.560]   that is ridiculous.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.620]   You cannot compare the effects of kratom
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.820]   to the effects of hydrocodone.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.180]   But the potency is about 1/6 of hydrocodone.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.380]   And there are people out there who are just increasing
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.220]   and increasing both the dosage
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.180]   and modifying the type of kratom that they're taking
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.380]   so that they're getting the kratom
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.020]   that has a particularly high concentration
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.740]   of one of the alkaloids
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.140]   that hits that mu opioid receptor hardest.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.960]   And in doing so, sure,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.540]   they're not getting the pure hydrocodone effect,
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.060]   but they're getting really close.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.620]   So my advice would be, if you haven't touched kratom,
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.740]   don't touch it at all, ever.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.520]   If you are taking kratom,
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.720]   you need to take note of what we just discussed.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.560]   Thank you for joining
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.220]   for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.620]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.220]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.480]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.720]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.700]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.840]   please go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.060]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.260]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.120]   it's really twofold.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.040]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.520]   for the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.800]   which of course will still be continued
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.240]   to be released every Monday in full length.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.660]   We are not going to change the format
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.240]   or anything about the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.680]   And to fund research,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.720]   in particular research done on human beings,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.780]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.580]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.780]   that we are most interested in.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.780]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.400]   that is in toward developing further protocols
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.440]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.360]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.760]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.600]   but through all channels,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.760]   Huberman Lab Podcast and other media channels.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.360]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.560]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.720]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.460]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.480]   in the first place.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.800]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.760]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.400]   to do a dollar for dollar match
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.320]   on all funds raised for research
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.040]   through the premium channel.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.520]   So this is a terrific way
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.540]   that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.120]   through the premium channel to further support research
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.720]   for science and science related tools
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.980]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.820]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.580]   for the Huberman Lab Premium Channel,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.640]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.440]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.800]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.680]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.440]   And you'll, of course, get answers
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.640]   to all the questions that other people ask as well.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.580]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.400]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.320]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.520]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.840]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.200]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.620]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.280]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.160]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.000]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.160]   (upbeat music)
