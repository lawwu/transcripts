[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   All right, let's do some questions of our own.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.400]   Some deep questions of our own, Jessie.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.260]   I have two in a row that are about children.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.760]   So I figure we'll do, we'll start off our questions today
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.400]   with a child question block.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640]   Our first one comes from Sarah.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.680]   Sarah says, "I'm particularly fascinated
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.360]   "in digital minimalism from a parent's perspective.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.140]   "I'm really concerned about how my children,
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.520]   "the oldest of which is currently nine."
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.000]   Sarah, by the way, my oldest is also nine.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.280]   So this is relevant.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.080]   "I'm particularly concerned about how my children
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.580]   "will navigate the digital world as they reach the age
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.240]   "when they and their peers are likely
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   "to first obtain smartphones.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.320]   "Here in the UK where we live,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.300]   "this is generally as they start secondary school at age 11.
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.000]   "I'm equally concerned how they will navigate adolescence
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.220]   "in the digital world we live now.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.380]   "I'd really appreciate any information or advice
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.240]   "you may have directed towards parents on this topic."
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600]   Well, Sarah, I do have some thoughts.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   These are the thoughts that makes me very unpopular
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720]   among a lot of young adolescents,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.120]   but I will give them to you nonetheless.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   Here's my TL;DR summary of digital engagement and kids.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   "I would worry about giving unrestricted smartphone access
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.460]   "to anyone under the age of, let's say, 16 or 17."
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.860]   In other words, 16 or 17 is probably
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.780]   the appropriate earliest age
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.660]   to give unrestricted smartphone access to a kid,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.140]   certainly not 11.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.220]   There's a couple issues here that are relevant.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.920]   "I believe the evidence is becoming increasingly clear
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.980]   "that social media use during early adolescence
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.500]   "and during puberty or pre-puberty
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.220]   "is really potentially psychologically quite damaging."
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.300]   Now, your kid might be fine,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.020]   but there's a big chance that they won't be.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.740]   This is a danger zone.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740]   Early adolescent girls in particular
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.660]   who do heavy social media use,
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.060]   there's some real scary signals there,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.460]   but forget the debates about the research literature.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.220]   Social psycho-literature is very difficult.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.320]   It's very difficult to get clear signals on anything.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.360]   Just look at the target audience itself
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.680]   and see what they self-report.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.600]   I hear this again and again from young adolescents.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.080]   This is a source of anxiety.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.120]   This is a source of feelings of self-harm.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.480]   This is ruining my life.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.800]   All occasions pointing towards
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.520]   heavy social media use on their phone.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.440]   There's other issues with unrestricted
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.500]   smartphone use as well.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.540]   Excessive video game playing is a big deal.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.060]   These games are very addictive,
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.600]   especially those that are massively
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.340]   multiplayer online style games.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.220]   Give, for example, a young adolescent male
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.780]   unrestricted access to games on their phone,
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.460]   and you might get six, seven plus hours of playing.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.020]   They'll play them into the night.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.180]   They'll show addictive tendencies
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.820]   where they can act out with anger or rage
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.540]   if the screen is trying to be taken away from them.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.000]   Their brains are not ready for that.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.900]   I think that is really damaging.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.640]   The other issue is pornography.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.360]   You give unrestricted smartphone use
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.600]   to a 12 or 13 year old,
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.700]   you are going to potentially generate
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.760]   some real issues with their developing sexuality.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.560]   You might also develop some real issues
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   in how they actually relate to or treat
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.360]   with respect or not the opposite sex.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.680]   These are real issues.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.960]   And we shrug our shoulders at it and say,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.000]   yeah, but the other kids are doing it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.540]   And I don't think that's a strong enough rationale.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.200]   I don't think that's a strong enough rationale.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.520]   So what should you do instead?
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.480]   At the appropriate age,
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.760]   get them a phone with text messaging,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.160]   but does not have the standard OS
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.760]   that can run social media apps
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.680]   and unrestricted web browsing.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.780]   Get them a dumber phone,
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.560]   a feature phone that has text messaging.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.200]   Sure, that's useful.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.760]   That's very useful.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.740]   Text me when you're done with practice
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.580]   and you want to be picked up.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.920]   Let me text my friend and say, I'm coming over now.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.760]   I think that's fine.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.940]   I'm completely fine with that modern convenience.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.880]   I mean, when I was in high school,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.720]   it was all about pay phones
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.540]   and we had a calling card numbers.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.160]   We had memorized and quarters,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.640]   and you would try to call
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   and hope that your parent was there.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.440]   And if not, you waited.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   And that's not great from a convenience standpoint.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.960]   So texting is fine,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.840]   but not unrestricted access to the web or standard apps.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.360]   What you also have to do instead
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.460]   is help encourage and guide your child
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.360]   so that they can find a social community
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.460]   aimed at some sort of common objective or goal,
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.920]   whether this is a theater troupe or a sports group
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.920]   or a band or a small fledgling teenage company,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.640]   or they're in the first robotics club
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.980]   and in some sort of STEM style gathering,
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.820]   whatever it is,
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.100]   but something that they can be with other people
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.660]   and build up their skills
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.380]   and feel the sting of defeat
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.540]   and enjoy the camaraderie of success when they do well
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.300]   and let this be the core of their social experience.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.460]   If you have successfully a group like this,
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.700]   but you don't use social media, you'll be fine.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.100]   You're like, yeah, I have my buddies from the track team
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.760]   and they kind of rag on me
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.220]   because I'm not on TikTok or whatever,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.120]   or I'm not on Snapchat or whatever,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.420]   but we have this bond and we do these things
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.320]   and it's just like a quirk and you will be fine.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.720]   What you would want to avoid, of course,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.980]   is someone whose entire social identity
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.820]   is based just off of this digital world.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.660]   That's no good.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.660]   And if you're in that situation
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.300]   and take away that digital world, you're isolated.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.900]   Yes, so we need alternatives.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.340]   And I think that's really the key
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.540]   to making it palatable for a 12, 13, 14, 15,
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.060]   maybe 16 year old not to have access to these phones
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.300]   is that they are entrenched in things that matter to them,
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.580]   that connect them to other people
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.140]   and give them meaning and forward drive.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.420]   That's what we're wired for.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.240]   That can satisfy it.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.940]   They will survive without it.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.620]   The only other point I want to say, Sarah,
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.220]   is I picked up a strong current
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.900]   during my digital minimalism book tour.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.900]   I picked up a strong current from contemporary adolescents
[00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.780]   of a backlash against these companies.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.860]   In the last few years,
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.680]   I've seen this major social media backlash.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.380]   This is media backlash against social media.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.240]   Mark Zuckerberg has been transformed
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.960]   into a devil style character.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.820]   Twitter is raked through the coals.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.620]   This is all out there in the zeitgeist.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.500]   I don't think these apps have the same atmosphere
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   of countercultural cool that they used to.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.740]   Now the countercultural move is perhaps to say,
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.920]   I don't use any of these things.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.340]   Forget you, Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.140]   I'm not going to use your app.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.660]   Forget you, ByteDance.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.860]   Good for you for getting a billion users
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.140]   to TikTok in only four years.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.940]   I don't want to be a part of your attention mining factory.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.300]   There is a growing countercultural street cred
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.540]   in being someone who knows what you're about
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.580]   and you're 14 and you're not on those things
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.980]   and you're killing it somewhere else and people like you.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.240]   That thread was definitely one that was growing.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.900]   And I think it's getting easier and easier
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.860]   to be one of those younger people
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.420]   who doesn't use these services.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.060]   It's not seen as square,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.900]   I think as much as it might be seen as forward looking.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.240]   So this is all going to get easier, Sarah.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.180]   So resist getting them a phone for now.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.940]   Hopefully by the time your nine-year-old is 11,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.820]   it'll be considered quite standard
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.740]   the fact that you are not giving them a smartphone.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.900]   And even if it's not, you should resist.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.580]   - I have a quick two questions actually.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.780]   So in terms of getting the appropriate phone
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.660]   for just text messaging, when do you think that should be?
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.260]   - I mean, I guess it's regional.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.620]   So around here, I don't know, it could be pretty early.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.820]   Like around here, I know nine and 10-year-olds
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.900]   where they don't give them a phone yet,
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.200]   but they give them these watches
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.780]   and the watches allows them,
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.460]   there's three numbers programmed into it
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.820]   that they can call.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.180]   So like this is typically their parents, right?
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.460]   And then you can do text messaging on the phone,
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.300]   but I think it's pre-programmed text,
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.900]   like a mom, my wife, or you're talking to it
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.740]   or something like this.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.560]   But again, you can only talk
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.060]   to a small number of people on it.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.580]   And it can also be a GPS tracker
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.140]   that your parents can use.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.140]   And like around here,
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.440]   these watches will sometimes be used to allow,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.460]   like to give more freedom to like a nine and 10-year-old.
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.580]   Like you can walk to school and back or go to the stores
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.620]   because like if you have some issue,
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.580]   you can just like press the button and it'll call me
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.900]   and I can come get you or something like that.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.380]   So there's these transitional things
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.340]   that I think are good in these close in city environments
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.540]   where people are otherwise worried
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.380]   to have their kids be completely free.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.740]   I don't know, I mean, to me, text message available phone,
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.460]   I mean, I'm thinking middle school.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.700]   I don't know if that sounds reasonable to you.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.740]   I mean, the kids you coach are older, right?
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.580]   They're high school.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.400]   - Yeah, they are.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.140]   - They're all plugged into the matrix, right?
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.700]   - One other question though, in terms of computers,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.380]   like getting kids on computers and doing that sort of thing,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.860]   is there a crossover or?
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.900]   - Yeah, but I think,
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.500]   the next question is gonna be relevant to this.
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.460]   I think it's good for kids to have access to computers
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.340]   but it should be in public.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.300]   Here is the family computer.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.920]   It's in the middle of everything.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.540]   As we go about our business, preparing dinner,
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.560]   this or that, we see what you're doing.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.920]   Don't have a computer in the room, at least until,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.760]   - In their room.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.440]   - Yeah, you're 17 and you're a hacker
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.640]   and you're gonna go to MIT the next year and like, fine.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.440]   You can go do your computer hacking
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.720]   but you're 12, 13, 14 years old.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.280]   Hey, you wanna go on like the Minecraft forum or whatever
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.160]   and that's fine, but I'm gonna, it's out here
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   and we're gonna see what you're up to.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.360]   - Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.400]   (upbeat music)
