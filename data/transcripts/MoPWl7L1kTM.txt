[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   It's no secret that many Christians find spiritual nourishment from prominent
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.600]   podcast preachers online, and I least of all would include you, Pastor John. So, how
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.800]   would you encourage these same Christians to also appreciate the role
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.400]   of their pastor or pastors that God has placed over them in their local churches?
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.320]   We ought to appreciate our local pastors, the ones we see every week and
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.040]   whose word we sit under week in and week out. We ought to see them as
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.600]   indispensable because God does not say in Scripture that he has given to the
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   church podcasters. He says, "I have given shepherds and teachers, pastors and
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.440]   teachers." Ephesians 4 11, "He gave some apostles, prophets, evangelists, and
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:06.160]   pastors and teachers, and he gave them responsibility for particular flocks." So
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.880]   it says in 1 Peter, "Shepherd the flock of God that is among you." So a pastor is
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   not responsible for a flock across the world or down the street. "Exercising
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.760]   oversight, not under compulsion but willingly, as God would have you, not for
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.080]   shameful gain but eagerly, not domineering over those in your charge." So
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.320]   this is a picture that God has ordained for flocks to exist and shepherds to
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.480]   exist, and the shepherds have accountability for a particular flock,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.280]   and the flock has responsibility to submit to a particular shepherd being
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   examples to the flock. So there's a structure that no podcasting pastor can
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.520]   replace. This is something no podcaster can do, including me. The shepherds are
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.600]   given then an astonishing burden in Acts 20 28, "Pay careful attention to yourselves
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.100]   and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to all the
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.160]   flock," that's their flock, "to care for the church of God which he obtained with
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.120]   his own blood." That's just massive, what an incredible burden. "Take heed to all the
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   flock," this is your flock, you are their shepherd, "watch over them, care for them,"
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.080]   and the counterpoint would be true, that all those sheep should know that's
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.800]   his responsibility, they should submit to that, they should want that, they should
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.600]   feel wonderfully gifted by being in a church where this is believed. And then
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.160]   he tells us, "Obey your leaders and submit to them for they are keeping watch over
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.480]   your souls," Hebrews 13 17. And he says, "Respect those who labor among you and
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   are over in the Lord and admonish you and esteem them very highly in love
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   because of their work," 1 Thessalonians 5 12 and 13. In other words, God has designed
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.920]   normal Christianity, vibrant, healthy, durable, culture-shaping, mission-advancing,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.960]   justice-elevating, Christ-exalting Christianity to be a web of
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.760]   relationships in local churches led by faithful shepherds who care for the
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.360]   souls of their sheep. No online preacher can take the place on the ground of
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   these shepherds. And here's just two more things that come to mind. What we
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   should want from our pastor in his preaching is not mainly rhetorical or
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.680]   oratorical skill, but faithful explanation of God's Word and
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.040]   application to our lives, especially the life we're living together right here in
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.880]   this church and making an impact on our community. So value your pastor as the
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.200]   one who opens the word for you in your situation, in your community, in your web
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.240]   of relationships week in and week out. And the last thing perhaps would be
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   the huge importance of corporate worship as a whole in the life of a believer.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   Gathering with God's people every week—gathering, not just putting on your
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.960]   headphones and listen to a worship song—gathering with God's people every week to
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.160]   exalt Christ together, hearing other people saying great things about Jesus
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.720]   that you love and that you cherish is the way God means for us to thrive in
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.880]   relation to him. And my understanding of preaching is that essential to that
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.560]   corporate exaltation, exaltation in God is expository exaltation. In other words,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.480]   preaching is not an isolated moment of instruction like, "Oh now we just switched
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.700]   to class, now we just became a school on Sunday morning." No, no, no. This is a
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.400]   worship service. We are going vertical from beginning to end here, and we're
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   connecting with God, and at this point we are leaning on this pastor to embed in
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:29.680]   this worship service an exaltation over the Word of God to draw us in and let us
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.440]   hear God speak and watch him, the pastor, exalt in proper responses to the Word of
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.000]   God that he's explaining in the message. Podcasters cannot do this. They can't be
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.560]   built into the corporate worship experience where preaching comes into
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.480]   its own as an encounter with the Living God. So I love podcasting. I think it has
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.600]   a place of appreciation and growth and learning along with all kinds of other
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.720]   things we do in the Christian life, but nothing can replace the church gathered
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.240]   and the community of believers under the leadership and care and
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.760]   love of shepherds who minister the Word to them and care for their souls. Yeah,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.840]   thank you, Pastor John. And very closely related to this topic, see episodes
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.240]   number 94 and 103 in the Ask Pastor John archive, which is probably most easily
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.200]   found in the free Ask Pastor John apps for the iPhone and the Android. And be
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.160]   sure you update your app to get all the new features that make it really easy to
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.240]   search and browse all the episodes. We will return tomorrow with a follow-up
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.440]   question. So what are some ways to encourage your pastor? I'm your host Tony
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   Rehnke. We'll see you tomorrow.
