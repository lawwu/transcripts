[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   how much are they going to want to deal with really messy shit?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   If you, as a random citizen, want to buy one share of Apple stock directly on an exchange,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   it'll cost you tens of millions of dollars in a year to get set up to be able to do that.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   You got to get like a physical COLO, maybe?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   You know, you have to like have market data agreements with these companies.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   You have to think about the SIP and about the NBBO and whether you're even allowed to lift on NASDAQ right then.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You have to build technological infrastructure to do it.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But all of that comes after you get a bank account.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And let's even talk about that stuff.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Getting a bank account that's going to work in finance is really hard.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I've probably spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of my life trying to open bank accounts.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And one of the things at early Alameda that was really crucial to our ability to make money
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   was having someone very senior spend hours per day in a physical bank branch,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   manually instructing wire transfers.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And if we didn't do that, we wouldn't have been able to do the trade.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
