[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   I've seen a lot of people be affected by the osmosis of work ethic.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.200]   It's kind of like what's going on with me in the gym.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.280]   It became so not natural.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.360]   As natural as it comes to me to sell lemonade or sports cards or run businesses
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.640]   or be nice to people,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.680]   it comes equally not natural to me to work in the gym.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.560]   But, you know, we've known each other a long time.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.640]   Somewhere around 38, I decided to put in the work
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.520]   because I wanted to live longer and just thought it would be better.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.080]   And through osmosis practice, I'm now someone who goes to the gym.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.080]   I still don't love it.
