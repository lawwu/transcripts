[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.560]   today how life insurance policies actually work.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   This will be a framework that you'll be able to use in the future as you're making your
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.160]   choices and with this framework in your mind, you'll be able to look at any life insurance
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.600]   policy and understand the advantages and disadvantages of it.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   Let's go.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.420]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.280]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   Thank you for being here.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   This is episode 180 of the show and yes, we're continuing with life insurance.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520]   But I think you'll like it.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.360]   This is actually take two of this show.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.880]   Already recorded the show and wasn't happy with it.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.360]   So we're redoing it and I think that means that it is going to be awesome.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:48.640]   Or awesome at least is the goal.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640]   I'm going to deliver on it.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   You know what?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.920]   None of this hedging around that I often do.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.360]   This show is going to be awesome.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   I promise.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.360]   It'll be awesome.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   Now, time to deliver.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   Before I get into life insurance, I thought it would be interesting.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm just going to share a few minutes, just a little bit of personal background, a little
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.720]   behind the scenes stuff on the show.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.360]   I don't do this a lot but I will this week.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.320]   Those of you who listen to the show every day when it comes out, you'll notice that
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.920]   it's been a – I mean this is actually Friday at 4.20 PM as I'm sitting down to record
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   this show.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.560]   And this show was on the topic list to be Wednesday's show.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   This is April 17th as I record and it will be released today on April 17th unless I flub
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.240]   it and have to re-record it like I did yesterday.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.400]   But sometimes it's very easy to feel all alone and I'm going to share a little bit
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.480]   of the challenges of my week so that you don't feel alone with whatever you're going through.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.080]   Oftentimes especially in the world of public personality and media, the people that are
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.520]   engaged in delivering media, you often might think, "Oh, it's all easy and perfect."
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.960]   And you see finely tuned shows and you never get any behind the scenes impact.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.600]   I'll just share a little bit of behind the scenes with you.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.800]   So this week was tax week and I've been behind on my taxes for the last couple of
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.040]   months but there have been thing after thing after thing.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.240]   I'm not asking for pity.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.840]   I'm just sharing almost as just some chuckles.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.680]   If we were friends, sharing a little bit about the entrepreneurial journey.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.360]   But I hadn't filed my taxes earlier than April here and it's been on the list, been
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.360]   on the list.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.520]   I've been needing to get it done, needing to get it done.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.920]   But as with everything, as an entrepreneur, you're pretty much juggling everything and
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.640]   there's always something that's more important.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.920]   There's always something that's more important.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.400]   Even the last few weeks, knowing that this was coming up, I needed to get it done but
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.200]   how other projects are more important.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.320]   I'm not generally a last minute type of guy.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.920]   I'm pretty much – I've never filed – I don't think I've ever even filed
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   in April.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   Usually it's February or March.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   You get all the paperwork together, get the accounting straightened out and get things
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   done.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.840]   So I'm not the type of person who habitually procrastinates till April 15th.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   But just in terms of running the day to day operations of Radical Personal Finance and
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.720]   my family and life, it just kept getting pushed back.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   The big challenge of the last month or so was launching the new website and that was
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.560]   on a timeline because my web developer, the person who was helping me with the actual
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.600]   programming of the site and all of that, he was – and his wife were expecting a baby
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.240]   and I knew that when their baby came, he would be out of work for a while just because taking
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.720]   home, taking care of mama and baby.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.360]   So I needed to get that done and you never know when the baby is going to come.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.920]   So I had to press and press.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.720]   That was why the site was launched half finished.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.440]   It's still half finished and thankfully – because I'm able to improve things but
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.800]   I wasn't able to handle the launch of the site.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.320]   So I needed to get that done and that took priority over taxes and anyway, thing after
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   thing.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   So finally this week, Monday, I still hadn't finished the taxes and of course I could have
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.240]   simply filed an extension and that would have been simple to do.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.720]   I knew the basic numbers so I was able to take care of the tax payment without being
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.520]   behind and I could have filed an extension.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.600]   But I really wanted to get things done.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   I've never filed an extension.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.800]   I wanted to get it done.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.960]   So Monday, I sat down to get things done.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.840]   Now even though – the other reason I'm sharing this is even though I talk a lot about
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.560]   finance and I talk about accounting, it doesn't mean that I'm always able to keep everything
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.240]   in my life perfectly done.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.560]   I do a pretty good job but I'm human.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.840]   What's the old joke about the cobbler's children are the ones that run around with
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   no shoes and I get behind on catching stuff up just like anybody.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.960]   This last few months and this last year has been very challenging with closing – associated
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   with my financial planning practice, I had three distinct business entities that were
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.080]   operating as part of that.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.280]   I had to close those down, launching new business entities and my accounting system had just
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   fallen behind.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.520]   Again, how do you keep things going?
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.320]   So I knew that I had a lot of work to do and my accounting system needed to be more robust.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.440]   I knew what needed to be done but pushed it back, pushed it back, pushed it back.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.280]   So Monday and then Monday turned into Monday and Tuesday and then Monday and Tuesday turned
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.000]   into Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and it took me three solid days of sitting down and
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   working from morning till night to get all of my accounting properly finished and get
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.160]   my books properly wrapped up and to get things detailed because I'm a stickler for detail.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.400]   The details are where all of your good tax planning is and I had the details.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.600]   I had the rough outline.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.240]   I just didn't have all the details sorted out and get all the returns taken care of
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:44.680]   and for the first time in my life on April 14th, at 4 o'clock, I printed out the return.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   I sat down.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.560]   I signed it, had my wife sign it and I put it in the envelope and I walked down to the
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.200]   post office at 4 o'clock on April 15th, Wednesday afternoon.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.320]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.920]   I was so ashamed of myself because you always chuckle when you drive by.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   I personally have often chuckled in the past.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.280]   You drive by the post office and you see the lines there on April 15th and I think, "What's
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   wrong with those people?
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   I thought they'd be ahead."
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:14.640]   It's a good dose of humility for me that here I was on April 15th at 4 p.m. trotting
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.880]   it down to the post office.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.360]   That was the tax adventure and it was good.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.200]   Of course, again, I could have filed the extension.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   I had that ready to go in case I needed to just simply file the extension and do it in
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.560]   the future but I wanted to get it done and I was able to get it done.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.720]   So then Thursday, I got up and got ready to go and was getting ready to record the show
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.280]   and had some fires to put out with things that one thing turned into another, turned
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   into another.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.760]   Then I sat down and I recorded the show and I was most of the way through it and it just
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   wasn't working.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.440]   It's the content I'm about to deliver to you on life insurance and the challenge is I'm
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.560]   going to describe some concepts that are very simple to grasp visually if I could draw with
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.320]   you but you're listening to audio.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.800]   I try to keep this show very audio friendly.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.640]   I don't want you to always feel like you have to go back to the computer and look something
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   up.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.240]   I know that if you're listening to me while you're on a treadmill or driving to work
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.920]   or doing whatever that it's better if I can describe something verbally and it just didn't
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   work.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   So finally, I just scrapped it.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.480]   It was late at night and I had friends coming over and so I didn't get the show out.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.400]   Then today, I had planned to go ahead and I've got all the topics lined up.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.000]   I just got behind on the recording.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.040]   So I had planned to record two or three shows a day and go ahead and release them because
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.760]   I feel like I'm not keeping my side of the bargain of producing quality content consistently
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.200]   this week.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   And then the neighbor is pressure cleaning.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.680]   One of the challenges that you never hear until you start recording a podcast, you never
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   hear all the sounds.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.040]   I never knew there was a railroad tracks near my house until I listened to my podcast.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.240]   I'm like, "What's that train horn in the background?"
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.680]   I never knew my dogs made so much noise until I listened to my podcast.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.320]   I'm like, "Man, my dogs won't stop making noise."
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you never know that there's yard guys in your neighborhood until you start recording
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   a podcast.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.840]   One of the challenges I have with my production is every Wednesday, the yard guys come and
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.960]   the same set of guys do the houses on all sides of me, my neighbors on either side and
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.280]   my three neighbors across the street.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.800]   And so the entire day, they go from one house to the next to the next to the next to the
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.600]   next and they got the blower blowing and blowing and blowing and blowing.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.660]   And the noise is amazing.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.120]   So I have to be careful with my Wednesday schedules and recognize that and not be planning
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.880]   to record a show during the time of the yard guys.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.160]   Well then today, there is the pressure cleaning and the guy is doing pressure cleaning my
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   neighbor's pool deck.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.440]   And so I look and I look, "Okay, he's making good progress."
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.040]   And so finally, I hear it shut down.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:55.080]   So I sit down to record the show and I hit record and I launch into my intro.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.680]   And then all of a sudden, it fires up again next door and he starts doing the driveway.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.360]   So here it is at 4.30 in the afternoon for the first time.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.600]   It's been quiet enough for me to sit down and record the show.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.680]   And that's the situation we're in.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.960]   So it's 4.30 on Friday and I'm recording the first show for this week.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.040]   So I hope you can laugh with me.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   Joshua is learning.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.840]   Now, I'm in that classic stage of my entrepreneurial journey where everything is just kind of slightly
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.800]   out of control constantly.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.720]   I've learned to be mentally okay with that.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.960]   I'm a bit of a perfectionist to try to control everything but I've noticed that perfectionists
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.280]   rarely make good business people.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.780]   And most of the excellent business people that I've known just seem to get comfortable
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.320]   with some level of chaos.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.680]   And that's been a challenging lesson for me to learn is to be comfortable with some level
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.320]   of chaos.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.480]   But it's been good for me.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.880]   But I'm also in that stage where it's just been a challenging few weeks and I had to
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   sit down and say, "What's been working?
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   What's not been working?
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.520]   And my time management has not been effective the last few weeks and that's all right.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   I'm learning."
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.240]   So I just share these thoughts with you to encourage you that please don't ever think
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.520]   that when I come and share the thoughts I share with you, please don't think that I'm
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   anything but exactly like you.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.240]   We're all about the same.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:24.160]   And sometimes my life gets away from me and things get behind and I keep getting the show
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.640]   where I want it to be and everything's ahead and then all of a sudden life happens and
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640]   things change.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.680]   So I'm building out the systems and I'm building out my own personal habits and learning as
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.640]   I go and I'm excited that you're here sharing the journey with me and I hope you can just
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.760]   consider this little chat among friends.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Thank you all for listening.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.640]   I love sitting down and creating these shows for you and I hate it when I get behind but
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   you know what?
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.520]   Sometimes life happens and I don't think that it's not possible to do – it's simply
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.040]   not possible to do everything.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.760]   There's always enough time to do the most important things.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   There's never enough time to do everything.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.080]   So prioritization, this is actually my Achilles heel.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   Sometimes I don't prioritize effectively and I know the priorities I probably should
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.400]   have but then I don't follow through and so I'm learning.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.560]   So that's what's behind the show and so here we go.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   Let's get into the content.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:27.760]   Let's talk about life insurance and I've been systematically building these shows about
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   life insurance in a way that I hope will give you the background that you need to feel confident
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.360]   in your own personal decisions.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.480]   And the last show that I did on life insurance, we talked about how to decide how much life
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.800]   insurance you need and that's the very first place to start.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.720]   Do I need life insurance and how much?
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.840]   Now once you know how much life insurance you need and then you're going to quickly
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.800]   need to go and be able to sit down and figure out, "Well, what do I buy and then where
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   do I buy it?"
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.520]   which is a whole other challenging question.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.960]   But what do I buy?
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.860]   And the challenge that we face is that very few people in our society actually know anything
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.320]   about life insurance.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:13.880]   And it's tough to – life insurance is extremely complicated in many ways and so
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   it's really, really challenging.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.280]   So what I want to give you today is not going to be a practical recommendation on what to
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   buy.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   This is not what to do.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.200]   This is a little bit of a theory behind how life insurance policies work.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.440]   And I believe if you understand this theory, you'll be able to get a little bit closer
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.280]   to being able to look at a specific type of policy and understand what it is, how it works,
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.560]   and the advantages and disadvantages of it.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.120]   And then I will – in future shows, I will give specific recommendations on what to do
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   but you need this as background.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.640]   So let's talk a little bit about the history of life insurance.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:52.760]   I want to tell you how life insurance policy design came to be, how the modern world that
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.040]   we have came to be over the years.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.520]   Insurance as a concept has been around for a very long time.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.960]   Historians have been able to date it back to at least insurance, not specifically life
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.880]   insurance but to at least 2000 BC in China and then back to ancient Babylon about 1750
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:19.680]   BC as far as the concept of insurance with traders and merchants basically providing
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.080]   protection for themselves.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.920]   Life insurance goes back to the 1700s, the early 1700s.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   The first company that was actually formed to offer life insurance was established in
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.680]   London in 1706 and it was called the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.320]   And then ultimately that came over – the concept came over to the United States and
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.640]   it was developed of course internationally but I'm most familiar with the history here
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.000]   in the United States.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.760]   In its simplest form, the entire concept of insurance and specifically life insurance
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.680]   rests on the idea of risk pooling.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.240]   The idea is we all share – with life insurance, we all share the risk of dying prematurely.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.560]   We all share the guarantee of dying but we all share the risk of dying prematurely.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:20.760]   And so the idea is if you can work together and share that risk among a company of people,
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.320]   then you'll be able to mitigate the effect on any individual family.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.680]   So that's the entire concept behind insurance.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.460]   The initial most – the concept of insurance really applied were originally primarily worked
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.840]   out in fraternal societies and workers' guilds where people came together and said,
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.840]   "OK.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.720]   If one of our member of our society dies, then the rest of us will go ahead and support
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.360]   their family with a certain amount of money."
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.440]   And the first types of insurance policies were what's known as assessment insurance.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.240]   Assessment insurance is – the closest example we have to this in the modern world would
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.320]   be those of you who live in condominiums or places where you have homeowner's insurance
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.120]   and you from time to time might be assessed for a group cost.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.480]   Hurricane comes in, blows off the roof and you got to replace the roof on the condo.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.960]   The condo has insurance that covers some of it but then they send you a bill and each
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:27.120]   of you that are residents of the condo owns – owes $1,000 to the association.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.880]   So you're assessed a cost.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.720]   This was how life insurance originally was – in its most basic form was run, that a
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.600]   group of people would come together and they would say, "Well, we've got – there are
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:44.280]   300 of us in our fraternal society and if one of us dies, then all of us will kick in
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.480]   a dollar and we'll split that dollar out and we'll send that to the person who dies
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.200]   to their family."
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.960]   That was the original basics and that was a – originally was what's known as a flat
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.360]   assessment, meaning everybody contributed the same amount.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.120]   Over time, they started to collect these a little bit in advance so they would go ahead
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.360]   and collect the dollar from everybody in advance so that the next time somebody died, then
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.040]   the money was available and they didn't have to go and ask everybody for money at
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.680]   that point in time.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.200]   But quickly it came – became apparent that the flat fee, the flat assessment model didn't
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.720]   work quite as well because obviously the older people were dying at a quicker rate than the
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.920]   younger people and so the younger workers would find themselves putting in a lot more
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.820]   money than the older people did and the older people were benefiting from it.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:39.440]   So over time, that led to the concept of changing it to be – to graded assessments where instead
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.680]   of everybody putting in a dollar, then the younger people would put in a lesser amount
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.840]   and the older people would put in a higher amount.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:53.440]   Now in its first form, this was done on an initial basis and so if you entered into the
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.320]   society or into the workers' guild at say the age of 20, perhaps your fee was 60 cents.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.040]   But if you entered in at 40, perhaps it was a dollar and if you entered in at 50, perhaps
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.020]   it was a dollar 20.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.440]   But then once you entered in, your assessment would be the same on an ongoing basis.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.200]   Well, this didn't actually work out quite so well because the numbers – even what
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:23.800]   happens in a group of people that are pulled together, even if the average age of the population
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.560]   stays the same, the number of people that are dying continues to increase based upon
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:35.920]   the way that the body of – the mortality statistics work within a body of insured people.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.040]   So that led to the concept of premiums increasing over time.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.400]   So under this model, you would enter in let's say at the age of 20 and you would pay 60
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.320]   cents – let's just say per year, 60 cents per year.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.440]   Then at the age of 30, you would be paying 70 cents per year and at the age of 40, you
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.320]   would be paying a dollar a year and it would go on and on.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.220]   You get the point.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:03.440]   But this type of structure leads and led to a real problem and the problem is – has
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.480]   a couple of different aspects to it.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.640]   The first problem is it places a real – there's a real benefit for the younger people to be
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:20.440]   involved in the pool because their rates are really low and they have a need for it.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.840]   But there's little incentive for the older people to be involved in the pool because
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.560]   their rates are going up and they have less of a need for it.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.440]   This opens up the door for an insurance term that's called adverse selection.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.520]   Usually the pool would experience adverse selection because the people who were older
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.840]   that were healthy were likely to say, "You know what?
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.000]   My premiums are going up.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I just don't need the insurance.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.640]   I'm a pretty healthy person.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   Why do I need the insurance?"
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.440]   They were likely to withdraw and stop paying money.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:56.040]   But the people who were sick and likely to die, they're the ones who are likely to
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.240]   continue paying their premiums because they know they're sick and they need the insurance.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.240]   That's called adverse selection.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.120]   Adverse selection is a big deal for insurance companies.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.440]   It's a big deal in life insurance.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.000]   It's a big deal in every aspect of insurance.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.140]   This incidentally is exactly the reason why with the recent changes in the United States
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:22.620]   with the law regarding health insurance that when – that the reason why the government
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:29.280]   requires and forced everyone to buy health insurance was because without that enforcement
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.160]   mechanism there was no possible way for the insurance companies to insure everybody.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.440]   So the politicians wanted to force the insurance companies to insure everybody and to not be
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.240]   able to deny somebody based upon the state of their health.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.360]   But from an insurance company, that creates adverse selection.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.320]   That means that the healthy people are very unlikely to buy insurance and the unhealthy
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.880]   people are very likely to buy insurance.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.920]   And frankly, that's the situation that we have currently as the penalties start to increase
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.120]   and the government levied fines start to increase.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.680]   Even still, many people who are healthy might choose and say, "Well, it's cheaper for
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.080]   me just simply to be uninsured and I'll just pay the fine," whereas the people who
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.040]   are sick are likely to say, "I'll go ahead and get the insurance."
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.400]   That's adverse selection and it's in every insurance market.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.280]   Insurance companies have to guard very carefully against it.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.460]   It's a big deal in life insurance.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:26.040]   So this was the development of how life insurance policies started to come about.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:32.000]   Along the way, some advanced mathematical techniques were developed and there emerged
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.280]   the concept of actuarial science.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.040]   And the actuarial science is essentially specifically applied to life insurance is where you're
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.320]   able to look and figure out across any given population at what rate do the people who
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.480]   are in that population die at specific ages.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   And so then you can start to predict and start to assign some actual numbers.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.760]   Because what you find is these numbers are not consistent over time.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.720]   It's not a linear progression.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.360]   You don't, let's say that the risk of dying is, let's just say the cost of covering the
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.520]   risk of dying is not 30 cents at the age of 30, 40 cents at the age of 40, 50 cents at
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.640]   the age of 50, 60 at the age of 60, and so on.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.540]   It's not a linear progression.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:22.120]   It might be that the risk of dying at 30 actually costs 11 cents, but then at 40 it's 20 cents,
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.400]   and then at 50 it's 48 cents, and then at 60 it's 78 cents, et cetera.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.560]   It goes on and on because the risk gets exponentially geometrically higher as time goes on.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.040]   So that's the concept behind life insurance.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.080]   They started to develop risk tables and they started to come out with new types of insurance
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.280]   that were based upon this general population and these tables of how likely different people
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.640]   were to die, which leads us to the modern world that we live in.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.800]   Nowadays, there are published tables.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.040]   These are known as the – what are they called?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.360]   The commissioner standard tables.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   Those are from 1980.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.000]   I think the next one is from 2001 is what everyone is using now.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.360]   But these are the tables that most calculations are based on.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.280]   For example, the social security payout tech calculations are considered basically these
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   insurance tables.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.240]   The annuity rates go back to these tables.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.160]   These are the commissioner standard tables that are practically used.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.000]   Each life insurance company actually has their own tables and they probably are likely to
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.240]   use their own tables in figuring out their own life insurance policies.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.360]   But there are standard published tables that you can look at and use for various purposes.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.600]   Once you have those tables, then now you're able to sit down and start creating policies.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.200]   I'm going to describe to you two conceptual policies.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:43.400]   You can actually buy these policies but two conceptual policies as a way of understanding
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.640]   almost two different ends of a spectrum.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.560]   These two conceptual policies is at one extreme, yearly renewable term, and at the other extreme
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.520]   is level premium whole life insurance.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   I'm going to describe these to you so you understand the need for different types of
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   life insurance products.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.080]   Let's start with yearly renewable term.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.120]   The concept of yearly renewable term is essentially this.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.800]   You can buy an insurance policy from an insurance company where they guarantee that each year
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.600]   they will renew the policy for you.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   That's what yearly renewable means.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   They'll guarantee the policy, yearly renewable, it'll renew it every year, but the rates will
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.640]   adjust every year depending on your age.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.160]   So they're guaranteed to renew it for you but the rates are going to adjust each year.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:37.060]   This is in some ways actually the simplest type of insurance.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.040]   This is a pretty good type of insurance.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.200]   If you could just simply buy this policy and the rate's adjusting every year, then what
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.680]   happens is you're able to pay for the cost of the risk of dying at any specific year.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.520]   So at the age of 20, that's a great – I mean it's super cheap because the odds,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   statistical odds of your dying at the age of 20 are relatively low.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:05.320]   And then as your age increases over time, it becomes much more difficult to handle.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.640]   Picture in your mind a graph and we're going to do a simple chart.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.840]   It's going to be an X-Y axis and on the bottom picture – on the X axis, the bottom
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.880]   horizontal line, picture that going from the age of zero to the age of 100.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.400]   And then on the Y axis, the up and down axis on the left, that's going to be the cost
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.880]   of insurance.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:35.720]   And string a line directly from zero, zero to up at 100, 100 and a direct 45-degree line.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.820]   So you can see this line increasing in your mind at a one-to-one ratio.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:48.060]   For every unit of increase in age, there's a corresponding unit increase in cost.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.220]   Can you visualize that?
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.700]   Now that's what – it would be nice in some ways if life insurance went like that,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.260]   but that's not how life insurance works.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.420]   Rather, life insurance is a geometric curve.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:07.440]   So the way it actually works is take in your mind that diagonal line increasing from the
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.020]   bottom left to the upper right, ventrally grab it with your hand and pull it down and
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.600]   to the right.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:18.580]   And that stretchy shape where it's growing very slowly at the beginning and then it's
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.880]   growing increasingly, increasingly faster, that stretchy shape is actually how life insurance
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   rates work.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.820]   So it's a geometric curve.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.860]   Life insurance does not have that one-to-one increase.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.860]   It doesn't correspond.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:36.380]   There's not a one-to-one relationship between each year, one unit of age and the corresponding
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.380]   unit of cost.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.500]   Rather, it's very slow in the beginning and it's much more quickly as time goes
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   by.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.420]   So you can see the problem that you face is let's say at 20, the concept of yearly renewable
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.540]   term where you're paying exactly the cost of insurance for a 20-year-old, that concept
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.580]   works great at the age of 20.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.460]   But if you start to go on, it gets much more expensive.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.900]   And imagine for the sake of the example at the other end of life, imagine that you're
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.940]   99 years old and you're going to buy a $100,000 life insurance policy.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.420]   Well, if you come to me and you say, "Josh, I want to buy a $100,000 life insurance policy
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.140]   from you, how much would I need to charge you at the age of 99 to actually be able to
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.460]   make that contract with you?
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.740]   How likely are you to live past the age of 100?"
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.500]   Well, it's possible that you're going to live past the age of 100 and so I probably
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.340]   wouldn't have to charge you $100,000 for your $100,000 policy.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:37.460]   But my gut is that I'd probably need to charge you somewhere in the $90,000 range because
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:42.140]   if I made that deal with 10 people, it's likely that a good number of them are going
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.500]   to die between 99 and 100.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.180]   Now we could go back and check the mortality tables and the mortality tables would tell
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.660]   us exactly what that number is.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.580]   But it's going to be – my point is the cost for your $100,000 policy in that one
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:01.140]   year is going to be much closer to $100,000 than it is to be – than it is close to $1.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.900]   It's going to be far at the end.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.620]   And so this raises a real problem that as you age, you can no longer afford the cost
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.980]   of insurance.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.020]   That's fundamentally the problem.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.260]   So how do we solve that?
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:21.340]   Well, we could solve it if we could figure out how to charge you a higher premium in
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.620]   the beginning of your life so that we could charge you a lower premium toward the end
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.620]   of your life.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   That's where the concept of level premium life insurance comes from.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.380]   So if you wanted to buy a $100,000 contract from me, what if I said to you, "Well,
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.740]   I can't – instead of paying just this exact same – the cost each year depending
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.160]   on your rate, so it starts at say $20 a year when you're very young and it increases
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.700]   to almost $100,000 a year when you're older, what if I just said, "Well, let's just
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.540]   level these premiums out and so I'm going to charge you $500 per year.
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.540]   Well, let's start.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:03.860]   I'm going to charge you $1,000 per year from age zero to age 100 and then I'll pay
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.940]   – and you're just going to pay this level amount and I'll go ahead and give you the
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.580]   policy."
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.420]   We could do that and that was what was developed was the concept of level premium life insurance.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.580]   This was very, very important that it was developed because without the concept of level
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:23.940]   premium life insurance, you wouldn't have any modern insurance product.
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.780]   Level premium life insurance allows you to bring in stability and it allows the insurance
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.060]   company to set aside and create a reserve fund.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.380]   So let's ignore the rate of interest that we could earn on savings for a quick moment
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.620]   and let's just talk about this.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.940]   You come at age zero or your parents come at age zero and say, "Josh, well, we'd
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.380]   like a $100,000 policy.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.100]   So we're going to pay you $1,000 this year."
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   I take that $1,000 and I set it aside on the shelf.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:53.580]   Then you come in year two and you pay me $1,000 and I set that aside on the shelf and you
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.300]   come in year three and I set aside $1,000.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:59.820]   Well, after 100 years of $1,000 coming in each year, I'm going to have $100,000.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.340]   Then you die at age 100.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.940]   I can go ahead and pay that $100,000 out to the family.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:11.060]   Then ideally, because we get into the concept of risk pooling, if you die at 30, I might
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:16.020]   only have $30,000 but I'm going to have more money from someone else that dies at
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.420]   $110,000 and they actually pay me $110,000 and I can pull it together.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.620]   You can immediately see my math breaks down with these round numbers because I would actually
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:30.780]   need to collect more than $1,000 because statistically, the entire population is not going to live
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.340]   on average to age 100.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.260]   But hopefully you can at least just follow the verbal logic picture.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.860]   This is fundamentally how life insurance works.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:47.060]   Now if you add in another dimension, it really starts to work and that dimension is money
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.500]   that can be earned on – insurance is called the float.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.700]   The float in an insurance company is the difference between the premium dollars that you've
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.020]   taken in and when you're going to incur the liability that you've got to pay the
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.100]   money out.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.560]   So if I agree to insure your house from the risk of fire, you might be sending me premium
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.060]   dollars for 10 years and then finally your house burns down.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:12.620]   Well, I get to use your money for 10 years and make money on it before I have to return
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.620]   to you the money.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.920]   That's called float and it's very useful.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:25.060]   Insurance is a wonderful business because you can use it to basically create money.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.500]   People are giving you the money.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.740]   You're taking it, investing it and you could take that float.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.220]   This was a major part – some people, if you study one of the most famous investors,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.620]   Warren Buffett, this was a major part of his financial strategy.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:42.300]   It was buying and using insurance companies and then having access to the float, the money
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.700]   that they have where they're collecting premium payments before there's a corresponding
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.500]   liability that they have to pay the money out.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.060]   Even still, General Rhee is a huge part of his portfolio and a huge part of Berkshire
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:59.260]   Hathaway and they have massive insurance interests in many different types of insurance.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.820]   But the simple point for today is just that you can take the money and you can invest
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.820]   it.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.300]   Now, I can figure out some rate of return.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.180]   So let's say that in my simple example that doesn't actually work out mathematically,
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.300]   you give me $1,000 at age zero.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   I can take that and let's say I invest and I earn 5% on it.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.620]   Now I've got $1,050 and you give me $2,000 – excuse me, you give me $1,000 in year
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.260]   two and I add that to my investment.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:30.260]   Now I've got 1,100, 2,100, a little bit more on my money.
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.340]   So my money grows over time and I start to create extra money and that builds my reserve
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.900]   fund.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.540]   So this reserve that I have to keep in case you die and the interest that I'm earning
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.080]   on it is fundamentally how an insurance company operates.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:50.540]   So in a level premium life insurance policy, then you're overpaying in the beginning
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.360]   and you're putting in more money than technically the cost of insurance is.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.300]   The insurance company is taking that money.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.100]   You're investing it, earning interest, and they're setting aside a reserve in case
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.780]   you die.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:11.620]   Depending on the amount of that reserve, then they are – that's what the – that's
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.060]   the whole business of insurance is how much is that reserve that they're managing to
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.020]   pay out and cover their liabilities that they owe.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:25.940]   So this creates an interesting reality because the insurance company is never actually on
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:34.460]   the hook for the full $100,000 liability because in the very first year, if you've sent in
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.940]   $1,000 to start the policy, they're on the hook to pay you out $100,000 but they're
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.860]   only at risk of $99,000.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.220]   So they're never on the hook for the full $100,000.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.180]   This reserve is what backs up the policy.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.700]   It's what backs up the claim for the policy.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:59.060]   Now they've got to figure out and they've got to match the reserve fund to the liability
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.100]   when it's going to be paid out.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.580]   So we're sticking with a level premium.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.040]   Let's talk about a whole life insurance policy that historically, the number that
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:12.980]   used to be done with the 1980 tables and previously was that all life insurance – whole life
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:18.540]   insurance contracts would what we call endow at the age of 100.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:24.660]   So mathematically, the insurance company would match the amount of the premiums plus the
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:30.620]   interest in the reserve fund to the face amount of the policy, the actual amount that the
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.760]   insurance is for at the age of 100.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.780]   So in a simple way, they would collect premiums – in my $100,000 example, they would collect
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.700]   premiums from you every year.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:46.180]   They would invest that money and mathematically, it will perfectly equal out at $100,000.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:50.580]   The cash value of the policy of all whole life policies, the cash value of all whole
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.820]   life policies would exactly match the death benefit at the age of 100.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.140]   And this is the first time we're bringing in cash value.
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.140]   We're going to come back to that in just a second.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.140]   Now today, it's actually age 120.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:06.580]   But if you ever look at a whole life insurance illustration, what you will see is that the
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:14.900]   cash value and the death benefit perfectly match at age of 120 or 100 depending on when
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.380]   you bought the policy.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.940]   That's what we call the policy endowing.
[00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:27.020]   In fact, if you live to the age of 101 – my grandmother is 100 years old.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.340]   On her 100th birthday – and I actually haven't asked her.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.100]   I don't know if she had any whole life insurance.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.340]   I don't think she did.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:38.460]   But on her 100th birthday, if she had any older whole life insurance policies that were
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:44.700]   using those tables, then her whole life insurance policy would actually have sent her a check
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.260]   for whatever the amount of the life insurance policy was at the age of 100.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.460]   Incidentally, this is why the tables have been extended to the age of 120 because this
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.460]   is a real problem if your life insurance policy pays you out while you're still alive.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.860]   And so you don't want this to happen.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:04.020]   But that's why – among other reasons, but that's why the ages are age 120 now.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.020]   There is – there are types of life insurance more popular in the rest of the world than
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:12.300]   in the United States called endowment contracts where they actually pay out at a lesser age.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.820]   And so historically, you could buy a life insurance policy that would endow at the age
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.620]   of 70 or that would endow at the age of – in 20 years and it would go ahead and pay out
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.620]   the death benefit.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.500]   We'll come to that in a later show, a little bit at the end of today's show when I talk
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.860]   about the types of life insurance and on a later show.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:34.820]   So interestingly, this is where you bring in the concept of cash value.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.940]   And the key that people don't – often don't understand about permanent life insurance
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:45.580]   products is that the cash value is simply a claim on the reserve fund of the insurance
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.580]   company.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:51.860]   So the idea if you arrive let's say at the age of 60 and you have a life insurance policy
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.140]   that is worth – is going to pay out at $100,000, the insurance company might have accumulated
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.420]   $60,000 in their reserves by that point in time.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.280]   Well, that $60,000 is your cash value.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:10.020]   So if you cancel the contract and you say I no longer want to own this life insurance
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.320]   contract, the insurance company will send you the cash values.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.660]   The cash values represent the reserves of the policy that have been set aside and you'll
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.260]   get the $60,000 back.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.700]   Now the actual amount of the cash values will vary because we got to bring in some other
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:26.860]   factors.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.900]   For example, you've got – they'll vary based upon what was the rate that was used,
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.780]   the discounting rate that was used by the company.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.300]   The company is saying we're going to invest your money at 4% versus we're going to invest
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.380]   your money at 2% versus we're going to invest your money at 6%.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:46.820]   That will make a dramatic difference in the amount of reserves held by the insurance company.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.020]   And depending on the assumptions in the policy, if the insurance company is setting it aside
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.780]   at 2% versus 6%, that will correspondingly make a dramatic difference in the amount of
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.500]   the cash values that are in the policy.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.620]   It's also going to make a difference what are the expenses of the company and we'll
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.780]   come to these – some of these factors in just a moment.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.060]   But there are all these factors that actually influence what's the total amount of the
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.100]   reserves and what's the total amount of the cash values in the policy.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:17.940]   Now if you understand these two basic concepts of how insurance policies work, yearly renewable
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:23.980]   term which is a policy that is for a term of one year every single year and it goes
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.940]   up and you just pay whatever the rate is for one year's worth of insurance each year.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.940]   So that's at the one end.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.820]   And on the other end, you understand a life insurance policy with level premiums for your
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.180]   whole life.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:42.900]   Then you can start to pull from that different types of policy designs and you can change
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.820]   various factors that are going to change the premiums.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.220]   Now the most obvious one is how much insurance do you have.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:56.860]   So twice the amount of insurance, a $200,000 policy should cost double what $100,000 policy
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:57.860]   does.
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.860]   And incidentally, with most insurance companies, it does.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   It's an exactly linear process with the exception of what's called a policy fee.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.600]   So some insurance companies, most insurance companies will charge a policy fee.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.220]   So for each insurance contract, there may be a policy fee.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   It might be $50.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.980]   It might be $100, something like that.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.220]   But for every contract, there's a policy fee which covers the annual mailings, things like
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.220]   that.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.400]   And then it's exactly based upon the amount of insurance.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.180]   So twice the amount of insurance is exactly double the premium.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:29.340]   If you take that policy fee out, it's exactly double the premium for half the amount of
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.340]   insurance.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.260]   So that's an obvious factor that will change what the premiums are.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.300]   But the other things that will change it is how long does the insurance last.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:43.180]   An insurance policy that's enforced for a very short period of time will cost much less
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.540]   than an insurance policy that's enforced for a very long period of time.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.460]   And then another factor is how long do you pay the premiums.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.700]   And you can start to manipulate these factors and understand different costs of different
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.340]   types of life insurance policies.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:02.780]   You can have a policy that is enforced for a very short time period and you pay premiums
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:06.180]   for a very short amount of time, just on a one-time basis.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.340]   The best example of this is some of you who are older should remember when there were
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:18.360]   actually kiosks in major US airports that – where you could actually buy life insurance
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.460]   for your forthcoming flight.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.140]   This still exists in some parts of the world.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.200]   I've never seen them myself in the US airports but I know they exist.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.060]   So you could – you're getting on the airport – on an airplane in Topeka, Kansas and you're
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.940]   going to fly to Dallas, Texas.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.400]   You could trot over to a life insurance kiosk and you could buy insurance where if your
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.720]   plane were to crash on the flight from Topeka to Dallas, then you could – then your family
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.540]   would receive money.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.960]   Incidentally, this type of insurance is still in existence.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.140]   You just don't buy it at a kiosk but it's part of your major credit cards.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.920]   This is – most of us know if you buy an airplane ticket with a major credit card then
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.800]   – and you die on the airplane, then your credit card company will pay out a certain
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.460]   amount of insurance to your family.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.240]   Usually it's something like a couple hundred thousand dollars and you might need a platinum
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.620]   card or a card with certain benefits but this is – so it still exists.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.260]   We just don't buy it from a kiosk anymore.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:21.220]   It's just buy it with your credit card when you swipe or put in your numbers for the ticket.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.220]   That's the shortest period of time that frankly I can about imagine, a two-hour flight
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.260]   and a one-time payment and your cost of insurance is going to be pennies.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:34.780]   That's why it's included for free as the – as just one of your credit card payments.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.100]   The credit card company does have to pay an insurance company for that.
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:43.080]   Usually it's a reinsurance contract or they at least have to calculate it for themselves
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.880]   but the cost of an airplane going – the risk of an airplane going down is so infinitesimally
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:53.180]   low that it's – there's just – they don't – there's very little cost to
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.180]   it.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.880]   Now, you could also have – so that's a short time period and a one-time payment.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.980]   You could also have a very long time period of coverage and a one-time payment.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.520]   There's an insurance product that you can buy that's called single premium life insurance.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.420]   This is a single premium whole life insurance.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:15.220]   The way this works is you can make a one-time premium payment and you can have a life insurance
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.540]   policy that's in force forever.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.880]   It's an interesting product.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.340]   There are – from a tax perspective, you need to plan carefully here and I won't
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:29.100]   get into the details but this is known as a modified endowment contract and it changes
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.900]   the way that the taxation works on life insurance policy.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.640]   We'll cover taxation in depth on a different basis.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.940]   But you can actually say, "Joshua, how much would I have to pay you today for a $100,000
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.220]   life insurance policy?"
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.540]   And there can be many excellent ways to do it.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.500]   Incidentally, the taxation does not change for the death benefit of a life insurance
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.120]   contract like this.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.880]   So if you buy a $100,000 policy, let's say you're 30 years old, maybe the premium for
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.860]   that is going to be something like $40,000.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.600]   And so you write a check for $40,000 and you immediately have $100,000 of life insurance
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.040]   in force.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.100]   If you die, that $100,000 goes income tax-free to your family under US tax law just like
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.260]   every other life insurance policy does.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.280]   It's just that if you cancel the policy and you take the cash values out or you borrow
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.780]   the cash values out, that's where the taxation changes on a policy like that.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.520]   But single premium life insurance is a fascinating type of insurance product.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.020]   It had an interesting niche and has had an interesting niche in the insurance business
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:35.640]   the last few years, but with very low interest rates that are available in the open market,
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:41.340]   there have been fewer and fewer places for wealthy people to park sums of money and get
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.140]   a decent rate of return.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:48.560]   Well, single premium life insurance policies, the way they work is depending on the contract
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.960]   and depending on the company, you can recoup all of your cash values guaranteed within
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.420]   a relatively short period of time, a few years.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.740]   And then those policies are growing based upon whatever crediting rate the life insurance
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:07.320]   company is crediting to their single premium life insurance portfolio.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.440]   Oftentimes these will have a different crediting rate than other types of insurance contracts
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.940]   because of the extra portfolio risk that the insurance company faces of this concentrated
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:16.940]   income.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.940]   That was way too wordy.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:19.540]   Ignore that if it didn't make sense to you.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.540]   I'll cover that in a future show.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.160]   I don't want to get into the details.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.560]   But the point was you could buy – let's say you bought a $100,000 policy.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.560]   It cost you $60,000 cash today.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.220]   But you're guaranteed a $100,000 life insurance contract.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.040]   Your immediate cash values in the policy may have been $56,000.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.420]   That covers the agent commission and the underwriting expenses for the company.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.840]   But after three years, you're guaranteed to have your $60,000 in your cash values.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.640]   And now from then on, it's growing.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   Let's say the insurance company was crediting you a few years ago when I was actively working
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   in the market.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:53.980]   The insurance company might have been crediting you at 5 percent or 6 percent on your money
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.620]   over time.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.980]   But you're looking around and you can't buy a CD at half a percent.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:05.420]   So it was for the right sets of dollars, for the right person, the right circumstance.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:11.360]   It was kind of a neat opportunity because if you could do with having the money locked
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.040]   up in a life insurance policy, it's kind of cool.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.220]   There was no downside to it.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.260]   And as life insurance agents, one of those nice situations where there's no potential
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.740]   downside to the customer as long as you've worked through the tax things and you know
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.840]   the taxation that you're going to incur when you take the money out and you've calculated
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.140]   it to be an alternative – what are the alternative uses of the dollar?
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.140]   It was kind of a cool situation.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:36.140]   So that's called single premium life insurance.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.140]   Very, very, very, very, very small niche.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.960]   That's not the type of thing – it's not appropriate for life insurance coverage
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.560]   for a general family.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:47.420]   But it could be a useful place for somebody to park some money within the context of life
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.940]   insurance contract.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.260]   Now on the same hand, so that's long period of time coverage.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.260]   That's whole life.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.500]   It's enforced for your whole life and it has a one-time payment.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.500]   That's single premium life.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:04.380]   Now you can also have a long time period of coverage and a long period of payments.
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.300]   So traditional whole life insurance, it works exactly like at level premium whole life insurance
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   that we talked about.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.340]   In insurance lingo, this is historically called ordinary life.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:18.540]   An ordinary life insurance policy is a life insurance policy that's enforced for your
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:25.340]   whole life and it has level premium payments that don't change throughout your lifetime.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.820]   So you have a long period of coverage and a long period of payments, the payments you
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.460]   pay throughout your entire lifetime.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.980]   And by manipulating these options, you can design any number of policies.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.140]   So you can have – you can shorten up the time period and shorten up the payments and
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:46.580]   you can have five-year level term life insurance or what's one of the most popular life insurance
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:50.500]   products on the market today, a 10-year level term life insurance policy.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.060]   You shorten your period of time up to 10 years and you shorten your period of payments up
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.500]   to 10 years.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.020]   And if you wanted to keep the time period at 10 years but you wanted to shorten your
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.780]   period of payments, many insurance companies will allow you to pre-fund a policy.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.620]   And essentially you open a bank account with the insurance company.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.980]   You put in your premium payments.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.140]   So you could almost – you usually couldn't do it as a 10 years.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.980]   Some companies would be five years, seven years, eight years restriction on this.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.500]   So you go ahead and just basically pre-fund 10 years' worth of premiums.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.140]   You make a one-time premium payment and then you pre-fund the policy at 10 years.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.900]   So you can have 10 years of coverage and a one-time payment or what's most normal with
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.160]   a 10-year level term insurance policy.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:35.260]   You could have 10 years of payments and 10 years of coverage.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:40.060]   You could have 20 years of payments, 20-year level term life insurance, 20 years of coverage
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.440]   and 20 years of level premium payments.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:49.560]   You can have life insurance that's enforced forever, so a whole life insurance policy.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.200]   But you can have different payment periods that – so you can fund it for 10 years.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.320]   You could pay 10 years of premium payments and the policy would be enforced forever.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   You could pay 20 years of premium payments and the policy is enforced forever.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:05.760]   You'll hear in – these are not popular in today's insurance market but you historically
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.320]   had things like what we would call – in the lingo, it's called 10-pay life.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:19.280]   It's 10 payments for a whole life policy, 10-pay life or 20-pay life, 20 years of payments
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.080]   for a whole life insurance policy enforced for life.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.280]   Or you would have life paid up at 65, which means you make the premium payments every
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.400]   year through 65.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.600]   The insurance contract is enforced forever.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:38.840]   It's enforced for your whole life and/or you have life paid up at 90.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.920]   You had what's called extraordinary life.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   All these insurance lingos, they're all referring to different variations of how long
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.720]   is the contract enforced and how many years am I paying premiums.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.680]   That's the – those are the variations that are changing.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.840]   Back to the yearly renewable term, you can still buy yearly renewable term.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:02.880]   I will do an entire show on this of why I prefer that young people buy yearly renewable
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.480]   term instead of level term life insurance.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:09.960]   I'll do an entire show on it with numbers and as examples and all of that in the future.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.760]   But simplistically, the way these policies work is you can have the policy through an
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   age.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.440]   So earlier when I was describing how a yearly renewable term contract work, I led you to
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.240]   believe that you could keep this through the age of 100.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.320]   The problem is that if the insurance company offered that deal, it results in adverse selection.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:32.960]   That same problem that they figured out a century ago with the assessment policies,
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.920]   if you got into a situation where you're 70 – you're 60 years old, you've got
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.800]   incredible health but you're looking here and saying, "Man, my life insurance is getting
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.360]   so expensive," then I don't want this anymore.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   I'm in great health.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.280]   That's a problem because the only people that look down and say, "I'm 60 years
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   old.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.240]   Man, my life insurance is getting expensive but I really need to keep it," are the ones
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.440]   who are sick.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.480]   So all yearly renewable term contracts that are commercially available with the exception
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   of some variations of group policies will be based upon cutting off at an age.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.760]   So it might be yearly renewable term insurance to the age of 60 or to the age of 70 or to
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.520]   the age of 80.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.120]   In those later years, the premiums are going to be very, very high but you can't keep
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.040]   them in force up through the age of 80.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.240]   You can't keep a term insurance product in force through the age of 100.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.560]   All term insurance products are in force for a specific amount of time, a specific term.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.600]   That's why they're called term life insurance.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.820]   So there are ways to manipulate these variables and you can create an insurance policy by
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:40.400]   manipulating these variables that meets the needs of the specific financial scenario.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.960]   I'm specifically avoiding talking about variations of universal life insurance but
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.480]   universal life insurance, I'm aware of it.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.480]   We'll talk about it in detail another time but hybrid is basically a hybrid between term
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.600]   life insurance and whole life insurance.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.700]   So there you can actually get even more flexible where you can – with universal life insurance,
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.360]   you can be very flexible on your premium payments.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:07.100]   One of the major benefits of universal life insurance is you can – instead of having
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:13.880]   an inflexible, unchanging premium which is what a term insurance policy will have or
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.920]   a whole life insurance policy will have, with the universal life insurance policy, you can
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.640]   change the premium on a yearly basis.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.840]   In some years, you can pay more premium in.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.320]   In some years, you cannot pay a premium at all.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:30.160]   This comes with a massive amount of risk and universal life insurance policies have bit
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.480]   a lot of consumers on the butt because they just simply were not – they didn't – people
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:40.520]   don't – universal life insurance is an incredibly complicated product and the vast
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:46.520]   majority of people don't understand it properly and in my opinion – I don't know the percentage.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:51.440]   I don't know if it's the majority or the vast majority of policies but they're underfunded
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.960]   and there are some real conflicts of interest between the agent and the client that will
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   often lead to them being underfunded.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.360]   We'll cover that when we do a universal life insurance show.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:07.020]   But it's – but universal life insurance is a very valuable product because it comes
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.240]   with a lot of flexibility on this amount of the time that the policies enforce and also
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.560]   the amount of the premiums.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:16.320]   So in the right hands, in an expert's hands who understands how the contract works, it
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.960]   can be a very valuable product.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:24.000]   It can be especially useful for funding because of the flexibility.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.880]   It can be especially useful if you're using a life insurance contract to fund a deferred
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.540]   compensation plan of some kind.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.960]   But by varying these options, then that's it.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.700]   That's what we change.
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.120]   So how long does a policy last?
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   How long do you pay premiums?
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:47.400]   Another factor though that changes these numbers is what happens to the amount of the insurance?
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.920]   So you can have life insurance policies where the amount of insurance is level.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.560]   You buy a $100,000 contract.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.540]   As long as you have the contract, it's going to pay out $100,000.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.840]   You can have life insurance policies where the amount of money is increasing.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.240]   You can have increasing coverage and that can be on term insurance policies.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.500]   It can be on whole life insurance policies.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.760]   Every year it grows by the rate of inflation for example.
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.440]   $100,000 this year, it's going to grow at 3% every year.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.480]   You could do that.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.360]   You can also have insurance policies where the amount of coverage is decreasing.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:24.080]   The best example of coverage here is when you buy a house and you take out a mortgage
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.420]   and that mortgage is filed with the courthouse, you will quickly receive in your mailbox dozens
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:34.740]   and dozens of solicitation letters from various life insurance companies offering you protection
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.840]   from your mortgage to pay off your mortgage if you die.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.960]   These are often a type of insurance that's called decreasing term life insurance where
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:50.600]   each year the amount of the coverage decreases as you pay off the mortgage.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.840]   That's a perfectly valid approach.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   Usually you're going to want to shop them a little bit more than just buying them directly
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.720]   from whoever mails you.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.120]   But if your only purpose in having an insurance policy is to satisfy a liability in case of
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:09.640]   your death, then if your mortgage balance has dropped from $100,000 to $90,000, you
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.160]   don't need any more than $90,000.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.600]   So you can buy a decreasing term life insurance contract.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.680]   Now there are some other actual assumptions that are used by the company that will affect
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.120]   the price of the policy.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.840]   These are the assumptions that are invisible to you, the consumer, but these will affect
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.080]   if you're buying term life insurance.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.280]   They will affect the price of the term life insurance that you pay.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:38.600]   They will also affect – if you ever wonder, why don't all companies pay the same?
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.480]   It's these factors I'm just about to mention.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.520]   But if you're buying some sort of permanent life insurance product, especially a product
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.920]   that has cash values associated with it, these will dramatically affect the amount of the
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.280]   cash values that are in the contract.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:58.320]   And so these simplistically – this is basically what is the mortality rate of the risk pool.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.560]   So in any body – let's say you have a thousand – in the insurance business, we
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.560]   call them insureds.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.760]   You have a thousand people who are insured by the company, so a thousand insureds.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.680]   At what rate are these people dying?
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.800]   Is this a group of triathletes who are very healthy and none of them are fat and none
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:18.240]   of them smoke and they're just – they go to their doctor every year and they wear
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.320]   their sunscreen so they don't get their skin cancer, if that's even true.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:28.640]   And so is this a very healthy group or is this a group made up of a bunch of 400-pounders
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.420]   who are smoking three packs of cigarettes a day?
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:37.440]   So depending on what the actual rate of people dying is within the risk pool, that will affect
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.880]   the cost of the contract and/or the benefits of the contract.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.240]   That's why if you smoke, your rates for your term life insurance – and here's a
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.120]   little bit of industry tidbit for you.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.300]   If you smoke, the rates of term life insurance are usually two to three times what they are
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:58.080]   for a nonsmoker for term insurance, two to three times what they are for a nonsmoker.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.840]   Interestingly, for whole life insurance or various types of permanent insurance contracts,
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   it's not anywhere near – at least many of the scenarios in the past I get rusty because
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.200]   I'm no longer in this business.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.920]   But in the past I've done this comparison.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:16.560]   It's nowhere near two to three times the difference of cost and because whole life
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:24.120]   insurance contracts are always based upon a guarantee of paying out, whereas term life
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:27.200]   insurance contracts, the vast majority of term life insurance contracts never pay a
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.920]   death benefit because they run out.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.120]   People outlive them.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.080]   So if you smoke, that affects the price of the policy.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.680]   If you're overweight, that's why there are different grading mechanisms.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:42.040]   If you have a certain type of medical condition, you have high blood pressure, you have diabetes,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.120]   you had a heart attack, then you're going to get graded a different amount and that's
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:51.040]   because you're going into a risk pool into which there's a different mortality rate
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.920]   and you've got to be charged appropriately for the insurance company to be able to handle
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.320]   that.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.760]   Insurance companies, this is an area of competition among companies.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:09.080]   Excellent underwriting or somewhat loose underwriting can lead to various companies helping – it
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.000]   can lead to long-term results.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.840]   So this is why I feel very strongly that you're going to be best served if you can find a
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.440]   life insurance agent who is accustomed to working with many companies and especially
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:25.520]   someone who has access to a broad number of companies because there are some real competitive
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:31.200]   advantages of different companies price different types of medical conditions differently.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.140]   Some companies – for some companies, tobacco use is a big, big deal and for some types
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.380]   of policy design.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.880]   For other companies, you can get better rates.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:43.520]   For some companies – for example, in the past, I always enjoyed smoking cigars.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.880]   Well, some companies will give a cigar smoker a slightly higher rate.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.280]   Some companies will give cigar smokers exactly the same rate.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:56.840]   Some companies, you can smoke five or ten or 12 or 15 cigars a year.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.700]   Some companies, you can smoke three cigars a day but as long as you're not smoking
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.100]   a cigarette, you're in good shape.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:06.560]   So you need an agent who has the expertise to be able to say, "Ah, I had a client one
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.880]   time who owned a cigar shop and so this guy smokes cigars like crazy."
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.960]   Well, how much – how many cigars is he smoking every day?
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.040]   With some companies, his rates are going to be double or three times as much because he's
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.240]   going to be getting put into tobacco classifications.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.960]   But there are a few life insurance companies that I could use where we could go in.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.200]   You could write a term insurance policy and he's going to pay exactly the same rate
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.480]   as everyone else.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:34.400]   So companies will compete with one another and some of them feel like, "You know what?
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.240]   I can accurately – I can accurately underwrite the risk of heart attack.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.560]   So I'll go ahead and accept somebody who's had a heart attack in the past."
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.080]   But other companies say, "No, I can't accurately do that."
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.880]   Some companies develop very healthy pools of insurance and this is good if you're
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:54.720]   an insurance company because you've got lots of healthy people paying you money and
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.800]   so they develop that and that can be a real advantage.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.720]   So if I've got someone who's very healthy, then in the long run, I'm going to make
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.520]   sure they're with a company where that is very valued.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:09.680]   So if you kind of – I feel you need to work with somebody on life insurance who doesn't
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   just work with one company.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.840]   This is the real disadvantage that a lot of people who write life insurance for example
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.080]   had some friends who – their primary business is property and casualty insurance but then
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.960]   they write a little life insurance on the side with their one company.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.880]   It's a real disadvantage to working with that.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.280]   It's not that it's necessarily bad but you're better off served if you can work
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:33.360]   with somebody who has access to a lot of companies and you also want somebody with some expertise.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:39.120]   I had one case I was extremely proud of that – one of my more proud ones was I met – was
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.120]   referred to somebody.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.640]   I met with them and they said, "Listen, we would love to have" – this was a life
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   insurance case.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.160]   "We would love to have life insurance but we've talked to like three different agents
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.840]   and nobody can find us insurance."
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.080]   That was because the husband – I was working with the wife in this case but the husband
[00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:01.720]   was in his 50s or 60s and had a quadruple bypass surgery a number of years previously.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:03.440]   I said, "Well, give me a shot."
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:10.160]   The way those things usually work, those types of engagements work is you enter into a process
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.400]   of medical underwriting prior to applying for insurance.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.640]   So you get authorization from the client to release their medical records and I worked
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:22.960]   with a specialty broker who was a high-risk broker and this specialty broker was excellent
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.240]   at placing very difficult cases.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.100]   So you order the medical records and then you send the medical records off to various
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.400]   underwriters at different companies.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   There's a real level of expertise in this market and you package them up and you send
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.000]   them off and we were able to get an offer on life insurance for this client who was
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.360]   just a few years out of a quadruple bypass heart surgery.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.380]   Now the client chose not to accept it because the rates – even though we got an offer
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.200]   and everyone else hadn't even been able to get a single offer from an insurance company
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.320]   but because we were able to get an offer but even so the rates were still too high and
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.880]   it just wasn't worth the premium dollars versus the risk.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880]   But I was pretty proud of that.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.800]   It makes you feel good as an insurance agent when you've had three or four other agents
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.680]   that haven't been able to find coverage and you're able to say, "Look, here I've
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.460]   been able to find – I've been able to get you an offer."
[01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.000]   So at least you could get some insurance coverage if you want to.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.480]   Incidentally, this is one of the major people have asked, one of the big questions people
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.640]   are asking me to answer is, "Josh, talk about term insurance versus whole life insurance."
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.440]   You do enough work as an insurance agent and you start to work with enough people like
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:33.400]   that and you start to recognize that life doesn't always go as planned in the sense
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.000]   of, "Well, I'm just going to buy a 15-year level term life insurance policy and in 15
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.800]   years, I'm going to be so rich that I'm self-insured."
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.260]   Life happens and you've got – especially as an insurance agent, you've got to make
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:50.400]   sure that you're always keeping a couple of things forefront.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.640]   One of them is cost and another one is flexibility.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.680]   You need a financial plan that is very flexible because there have been a number of situations.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   Just consider this.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.000]   You're working with a young family.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   A young family, everything is going great.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.680]   You say, "We're going to buy this 20-year term life insurance policy."
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.960]   I've been in the situation.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.320]   There's real, real examples.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.880]   You're going to buy a 20-year term life insurance policy.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]   That's it.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.320]   After 20 years, you're going to be fine.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.720]   The kids are going to be growing out of the house.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.800]   After all, you're having two point – we're under two now.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800]   I think we're about two kids.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   You're going to have 1.8 children and you've got them now.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.680]   You've got a three-year-old and a one-year-old.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.600]   So Johnny and Sally are going to be grown and gone and out of the house and you're
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.160]   going to have all this money set aside because you're going to just pump money into the
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.760]   buy term, invest the difference sales pitch.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.560]   You're going to have all this money set aside and the markets are going to be great.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.160]   You're going to be super rich and you're not going to need insurance anymore because
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.100]   you're going to be a millionaire in 15 years.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:49.400]   But then all of a sudden, things start to conspire and here are the things that happen.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:55.280]   You find out that Johnny has got autism and it's severe autism or Johnny slips and falls
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.480]   while he's diving and now Johnny is mentally incapacitated.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.160]   So now all of a sudden, you're planning horizon.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.000]   Instead of being able to launch Johnny after 20 years, you're now in a situation where
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.080]   Johnny is going to need help for the rest of his life and now as a parent, you now have
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.040]   a child with special needs and not only do you have to plan for the rest of your life
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.920]   but you have to plan for the rest of Johnny's life.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:31.800]   Now in addition to that, the stress of having a child with autism drives you and your spouse
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.800]   apart and you wind up divorced.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.080]   So now because you're divorced and you're going through the turmoil and the stress there,
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080]   I'll pick on dad.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.120]   So dad starts eating too much.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.200]   Dad cheats on his wife because he can't handle the stress.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.920]   Mom's all worried about Johnny and dad just goes and finds a, how do they call it in French,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   a paramour on the side, a mistress on the side.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.560]   That drives the relationship apart.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.200]   The divorce destroys the finances because now you have mom and dad trying to maintain
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.080]   separate households and they're trying to take care of a child with special needs.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.680]   It destroys the finances and then the destruction of the finances and the destruction and the
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.000]   stress of caring with a child with special needs, dad starts eating Krispy Kremes on
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.160]   the way to work every day, picks up smoking again, which he quit when the kids were born,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.560]   but he picks up smoking again and all of a sudden dad runs into some medical issue or
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.480]   gets diabetes and now 20 years later you need life insurance and you can't get it but you're
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:28.400]   poor because you had a special needs child and you invested all your money in trying
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.000]   to help your child get well again and you can't get insurance anymore because you've
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.160]   got diabetes and your A1C levels are through the roof.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:44.920]   Even they've done that and that's tough.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.660]   When you're a financial planner trying to help a family in that situation, that's tough.
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.680]   So you've always got to keep these things when building financial plans and right now
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.760]   I just talked to you financial planners.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.940]   Make sure that you are keeping flexibility forefront in your mind.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.840]   You need to build flexibility.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.240]   You don't just account that everything's going to go great.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.360]   The other thing I could throw into that scenario, I meant to, I forgot, I got all excited with
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:17.640]   my example, but all of a sudden you go through a period of time from 2000 to 2015 and you've
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.420]   got the so-called lost decade and you faithfully put your money into the index fund every year
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:28.280]   and you're sitting there in 2010 with the same amount of money you had in 2000 because
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.520]   by the time you pulled out your fees and your commissions, all of a sudden now you're at
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.200]   exactly the same situation where the dividends weren't enough to make it grow.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.560]   So this is real life.
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.640]   This is real life financial planning.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.480]   So yes, it's good to start with an actual outline of what you're going to do, but build
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   flexibility in.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.880]   Plan for things not to work.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.940]   There's a reason you carry a spare tire in the trunk of your car.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.480]   There's a reason why you don't leave at the last minute.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480]   You leave early.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.080]   You account for traffic and your financial plans have to account for that as well.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.280]   So we're talking about it another day, but that's one of the reasons why I'm so passionately
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.920]   anti-level term life insurance for young people.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:13.400]   Young people need to have renewable term life insurance because it builds flexibility and
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.240]   what can happen is, I mean, in essence, in 30 more seconds on this topic and I'll get
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:24.160]   off of it, but with yearly renewable term life insurance, you've got choices.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.920]   You don't automatically lose your insurance in 10 years.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.440]   So you have the choice to be able to continue your insurance for a very long period of time.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:37.920]   Like all of my term life insurance is called term insurance to the age of 80.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.040]   I've got from now through the age of 80 at which I can keep the insurance.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.240]   Now the rates get very expensive in about your late 40s and 50s.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.560]   I don't plan to keep the term life insurance until that time, but I'll tell you what, if
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.880]   I need it, I'm glad to have it.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   If I'm still healthy at 45 and I need life insurance, I'll just go ahead and buy a cheap
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:08.000]   10-year level term life insurance policy at that point in time and then I'll get my cheaper
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.880]   deal and I'll drop the term life insurance.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.980]   But if my wife and I have two kids and our second one is a baby girl and she's expected
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:23.000]   this in June, what if all of a sudden I find out in June that I have a little baby girl
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.720]   that's born with Down syndrome?
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.320]   All of a sudden my world and my financial plan gets completely changed.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.880]   Completely changed.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:37.520]   So one of the other things that's very valuable to me about my term insurance is I can convert
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.280]   it from term life insurance to various types of permanent life insurance and whole life
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.760]   insurance any time between now and the age of 60.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.680]   So that gives me the option if I were to sit down and say, "Wow, now all of a sudden instead
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.840]   of me just planning for the financial future of my wife and me, I've got to plan for the
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.080]   financial future of a child with special needs.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.320]   Now I've got another arrow in my quiver, so to speak.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:08.640]   And if in the meantime I've gotten sick or fat, fatter, and I need to buy – I can't
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:09.640]   get insurance at good rates.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.320]   I've got it all locked in while I was young and healthy and in good shape."
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:17.000]   So I got a little bit off on a tangent there but hopefully it's helpful.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.600]   New financial planners, plan for flexibility.
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.000]   There's a real balance.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.580]   You need to get a good deal on your money.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.960]   You need to get cheap pricing.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.800]   But you also need to have flexibility and you've got to hold these things together.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.840]   And I don't believe myself with most things in finance that the very cheapest is the most
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840]   important.
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840]   I learned a lesson.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.120]   I've got two car accidents – three.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.600]   Somebody backed in it.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:50.000]   I haven't had many car accidents in my life but I had a pretty scary one.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.360]   It was a couple of years ago.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:59.360]   My wife and I – my wife was pregnant with our first child and we were driving up 95
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.040]   in the rain and we hit it.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.200]   There was a turn in the road and there was a massive puddle of water.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.240]   It was a construction zone at the bottom of it and we hydroplaned and it bounced back
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.400]   and forth across the barriers at 60-something miles per hour.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.040]   My tires were in good shape.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:19.720]   But until that time, I never appreciated the importance of replacing tires at an early
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:20.720]   age.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.920]   But I'm not running tires till the point where they're zero.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.120]   Some things in life, you get to the point you say, "I'm not running my tires until
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.360]   they're bald.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.680]   I would rather spend a little bit of extra money in tires to make sure I have good tread
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.160]   on my tires and that my family is going to be safe than take the risk of saying I've
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.760]   just got to milk this thing for all it's worth and run the risk of hydroplaning and
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:50.560]   instead of everyone being fine, thankfully, me killing myself or killing my wife or killing
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   one of our kids.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   I mean, how do you live with yourself after that?
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560]   It's very, very difficult.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   Very, very difficult.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.000]   So let me get back to my outline and let's wrap this show up.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.600]   I got a little sidetracked but I hope it was helpful for you.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.520]   So there are some factors that are specific to the insurance company that affect the policy
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.200]   and here's where I'm at in my outline.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.720]   The policy designs that affect the cost of a policy is how long does the policy last,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.520]   how long do you pay premiums and then what happens to the amount of the insurance?
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   Is it increasing?
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   Is it decreasing?
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.080]   Then here are some of the assumptions of the company.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.920]   I was talking about mortality rate of the risk pool.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.520]   That was where I got off track there.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.880]   But the second one is what are the company's expenses?
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.920]   So what are the actual internal costs of the company?
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.480]   How much do they pay their CEO?
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.800]   How much do they pay their staff?
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.860]   How much do their buildings cost them?
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.320]   This is a big deal.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.520]   And incidentally, this is where you get into the question of how is the company organized?
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.200]   Is it a stock insurance company or is it a mutual insurance company?
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.680]   In the insurance world, this is a big deal.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.980]   With a stock insurance company, the company is owned by the stockholders, which means
[01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:56.360]   one of the expenses of the company is the profit that's being paid to the stockholders,
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   the owners of the company.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.600]   In a mutual insurance company, there is no profit paid to the stockholders.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   Rather, everybody who owns an insurance policy owns the company.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.640]   This is why I try to do all of my banking with – if I could, with a credit union instead
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.800]   of a bank.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.360]   I kind of have a hybrid right now with USAA.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:15.720]   I bank with USAA primarily and I also have a local credit union.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.000]   But USAA does a great job and they're owned by – it's a mutual insurance company owned
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.320]   by their policy owners and the banking side feeds the insurance side.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.480]   So I get that into my dividend on my car insurance every year.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.200]   But if you're banking with a big bank, especially one of the big – what Clark Howard called
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.640]   the big monster mega banks, man, quit.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.040]   Go find a local credit union because you can cut out.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.680]   You might own Bank of America in your portfolio but there's a cost.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.760]   You're always going to be paid a lower rate of interest on your deposits and you're
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.300]   always going to pay a higher rate of interest on your loans simply because you have to pay
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.000]   the stockholders of the company.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.380]   Well, credit union, you don't have that problem.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.380]   Same thing with insurance.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.000]   So if I can do – I can't find a mutual insurance company from a homeowner that will
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.280]   write homeowner's insurance for me in South Florida.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.000]   But if I could, that's a big factor.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.480]   It's not the only factor.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.720]   You still got to price it and you'll find anomalies in the market.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720]   Same thing with insurance.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.400]   It's not automatic that you choose a mutual life insurance company instead of a stock
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.080]   life insurance company.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.280]   But there are anomalies and your agent needs to send you in the direction of wherever you're
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.080]   best served.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   But it's a big factor.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:28.760]   Then the final of the internal factors that affect an insurance company is what are the
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.440]   actual investment returns that are earned on the reserves?
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.800]   How do they invest the reserves?
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.280]   This can go in various directions.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.080]   Maybe they invest very conservatively and that's a good thing.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.560]   AIG, they're investing insurance company reserves.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.240]   It didn't work out so well with them.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:53.200]   I'm referring to 2008 with all the credit – the CDOs and the credit default swaps
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.000]   that they were – CMOs and then the credit default swaps that they were investing in.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.880]   But the rate of return that they actually earn on their investments is going to dictate
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.960]   what the costs of the insurance company are.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.800]   Incidentally, this is why one of the biggest challenges of the last five years with the
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.920]   historically low interest rates that we've been, it has had a major impact on insurance
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.840]   companies because insurance companies generally are forced to invest much more conservatively
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.760]   than many other people.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.640]   Because they have liabilities, they have to pay out claims.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   They have to keep – they're actually legally required by law to keep their money invested
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.840]   in a much safer way, much less volatile way, usually that leads to fixed income.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:38.400]   Well, with the fixed income investment rates, just in the zeros, that's very challenging
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.240]   for those who are in charge of operating an investment portfolio for an insurance company.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:47.920]   So this is just the tip of the iceberg with life insurance and these are some of the reasons
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.520]   why it's so difficult to get a straight answer from someone who is an expert on insurance
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.280]   and you say, "Well, what should you do?"
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.440]   These are just some of the factors affecting life insurance policies.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.240]   It's so difficult.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.800]   It requires such a level of expertise to actually accurately compare insurance contracts and
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.480]   to accurately compare insurance companies.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:16.080]   That's why in general with mainstream personal finance advice, basically your advice is just
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.280]   buy some cheap 10 or 20-year level term life insurance because for a good life insurance
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.280]   agent, they can understand these factors.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.120]   They've hopefully done their homework and they can really serve the client.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.520]   But for an unethical life insurance agent, you can take advantage of people all over
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.640]   the place and many life insurance agents have, which is why the life insurance industry has
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.800]   such a horrific reputation.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:46.560]   It's very difficult to get a straight answer on these things from an expert because there's
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560]   a lot of factors.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:51.160]   I've just covered the basics.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:58.280]   I'll go over policy design ideas in a different show and go over each type of life insurance.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.120]   But there are essentially five basic types of life insurance contracts.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.860]   There's term life insurance.
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.680]   There's whole life insurance.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.840]   There's universal life insurance.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.800]   Then there's what are called endowment life insurance.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.860]   Endowment policy is not common anymore in the United States but still common elsewhere
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.260]   in the world and annuities, which are a subset of life insurance.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.600]   They really are life insurance even though they in essence work exactly the opposite
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   of life insurance.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.360]   The purpose of life insurance policies is you take a steady stream of payments and pay
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.520]   out a lump sum at death.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.960]   The purpose of an annuity is you take a lump sum and you pay out a steady stream of payments
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.400]   until death.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.360]   But annuities are only possible based upon life insurance tables.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:40.680]   So you take those five basic types of life insurance contracts and then you add on all
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   these other words.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.840]   Are we talking about a traditional life insurance policy, a portfolio-based policy?
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   Are we talking about a variable policy?
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.800]   Variable has to do with what is the investment contract.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.100]   You say, "Well, should I own mutual funds inside my life insurance policy?"
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.280]   That's variable life insurance policies.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.000]   Then you get into, "Is this a fixed contract or is this an indexed contract?"
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.120]   The worst thing is, "Is this a fixed indexed contract?"
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.800]   And then you play with all of these payment options.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:10.360]   You pay limited pay, pay it up at a certain age, ordinary life insurance, single pay,
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.480]   and you get to add in the modified endowment contract rules and you wind up with literally
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.520]   thousands of different various permutations of life insurance.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.240]   That's why we have the modern life insurance world.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.840]   There's a very simple – don't get too caught away with all of that for right now.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.160]   Think back and don't lose track of what I explained at the beginning of today's
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   show.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.720]   Yearly renewable term, level premium, and the mathematical constant is that the risk
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:43.080]   that's borne by the insurance company has to be met based upon the premiums that are
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.720]   being pledged by the insured.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.760]   All of the factors I just went over are just simple mathematical manipulations of that
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   general concept.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.480]   I hope you found this enjoyable.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:03.040]   I don't know if it was an awesome show but I feel a lot better about it than yesterday.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.600]   Yesterday when I recorded this and I erased it and did this one that you just heard, I
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.760]   was trying to go over those charts and it just didn't work.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.320]   Hopefully this was a little bit more effective.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   I hope you're enjoying this approach.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:22.560]   I've never in my life found anybody, any financial commentators who's done what I'm
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.560]   doing here.
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.160]   I'd learn all this stuff the hard way myself.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.840]   This is the conversation I never was able to find.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.120]   But I'm trying to – this is life insurance 101.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.560]   This is what you learn when you go get an insurance license.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.320]   It's not actually that complicated.
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.400]   Maybe I'm making it sound more complicated than it is.
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.760]   But hopefully this will give you a little bit of insight to start to understand the
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.640]   insurance contracts that are on the market and the different ways that you can use them
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.080]   and some of those aspects of it.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   So that's it.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.760]   I hope you've enjoyed this show.
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:53.760]   Happy Friday to you all.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.000]   I hope you have a great weekend and I will get this out here on Friday.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.840]   We should be back next week.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:08.400]   I've had different people recommend that I just stop even trying to do daily shows
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.160]   and I've thought about it.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.800]   Maybe I should promise you three shows a week and do more and we'll see.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   I'm thinking about that.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.400]   I think the major problems with the production show right now are just all me and on my own
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   personal systems.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.840]   I'm working it out.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.600]   I'll share them with you and I'll share with you my solutions.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   But I just thank you for listening.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.160]   It means the world to me that so many of you take the time to listen.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.240]   I think I'm out of things to say.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:38.320]   If you enjoyed this, if this has been helpful for you and if you are a patron of the show,
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.600]   thank you so much.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.040]   If you're not a patron of the show, please consider becoming a patron of the show.
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.600]   We are doing well.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:53.000]   We are up to 154 individual patrons of the show and $1,540 a month of monthly support.

[01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:02.560]   Patreon so I've closed out the other PayPal-based system and moved you over to the Patreon page.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.200]   If you're not a patron of the show, would you consider doing it?

[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.800]   Talk to you all soon.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:19.600]   Thank you for listening to today's show.

[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:41.120]   This show is intended to provide entertainment, education, and financial enlightenment, but
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:47.400]   your situation is unique and I cannot deliver any actionable advice without knowing anything
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.040]   about you.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:56.400]   Please, develop a team of professional advisors who you find to be caring, competent, and
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:02.520]   trustworthy and consult them because they are the ones who can understand your specific
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:09.680]   needs, your specific goals, and provide specific answers to your questions.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.880]   I've done my absolute best to be clear and accurate in today's show, but I'm one person
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.640]   and I make mistakes.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.080]   If you spot a mistake in something I've said, please help me by coming to the show page
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.640]   and commenting so we can all learn together.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:41.480]   Until tomorrow, thanks for being here.
