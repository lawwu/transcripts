[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (projector whirring)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:17.220]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980]   We missed the music today 'cause Duncan's not here
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.360]   and everything's just all over the place.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.300]   But Bill is sitting in today.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.780]   Duncan's a little under the weather.
[00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.760]   Bill Sweet, regular of the show.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.320]   Remember, we always appreciate your questions,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.800]   comments, feedback, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000]   Bill, the stock market is up today
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.540]   so everyone in the chat room is happy.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.640]   - Yeah, I'm feeling good.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.880]   Ben, the sun is shining.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   It's 70 degrees in Grand Rapids, as they tell me.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500]   It's a good day.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.340]   - We'll take it.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.000]   The funny thing is, so the inflation rate is still 7.7%
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   year over year.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.680]   Seems bad, right?
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.920]   40 year, it's still higher than it's been
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.560]   in 40 years or something.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.520]   And the funny thing is,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.560]   when we first passed this level in February,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.840]   I think in February, it was like 7.8%.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   And the stock market got killed.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.280]   It was down 2%, the day it happened.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.760]   The next day, it was down 2% again.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.480]   Like three days later, it was down another 2%.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.720]   Stocks got killed.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.880]   So we've been, the inflation data gets released
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.360]   on Thursdays when we do this show.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.520]   We've had a lot of bad days this year.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.960]   And of course, today, the inflation rate came out
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.720]   and it was better than expected and stocks are up 4%.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.380]   The NASDAQ's up 6%.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.840]   Everything's screaming higher.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.120]   - Yeah, go back a year ago and inflation printed 7%
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.800]   and investors rejoice, right?
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   - Yeah.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.520]   - How do you make any sense of that?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.360]   - This is why it's so funny,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.160]   because the markets run on not good or bad,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.320]   but better or worse.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.400]   And better or worse than expected,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.720]   especially in the short to intermediate term.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.860]   Obviously, over the long term, fundamentals matter.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.440]   But in the short to intermediate term,
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.120]   if you're confused, it's because better or worse
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.360]   matters more than good or bad.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.960]   And this, today, was better than expected.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.560]   And so investors are rejoicing.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360]   I don't know what this means going forward.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240]   Maybe we get rugged like everyone else
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.780]   and things go back to being bad again.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.200]   But for today, we'll take it.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   It's a nice reprieve.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.500]   - I'll take it too.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.960]   I just wish Duncan was feeling better.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   That's the thing.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   I would trade the market returns today
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.940]   for a healthy Duncan every day of the week, Ben.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.780]   - Yes.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.440]   - Feel better, feel better, my man.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.280]   - Yes, all right.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.200]   Let's do the first question.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.040]   - Let's do it.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.720]   Okay, Ben, for the average investor
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.820]   who's looking for a mix of stocks and bonds,
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.000]   should they use a simple heuristic for bond allocation,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.320]   such as bond percentage, 10 times interest rate,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   a max up to 50%?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.920]   If not, how should they know when to shift
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.340]   to that relative allocation?
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.580]   Another rule of thumb that I'm aware of, Ben,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.120]   just you subtract, I think, 50 minus your age
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.960]   or 100 minus your age, something like that.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.640]   - Yeah, that's a John Bloga one.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.480]   So I want to start this one with this.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.160]   So this question was an obvious follow-up
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.540]   to the one last week where someone asked us,
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.220]   how do you know when to change your asset allocation?
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.560]   So the starting question for this one was,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.880]   how do you know when to,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.120]   like what to start with at the beginning?
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.800]   And so I want to tell a story here.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Not too long after I started my blog,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.440]   Wealth of Common Sense, I think it was like 2014,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.800]   someone reached out to me and said,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   hey, I'm a retiree.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.400]   I send out an email newsletter to young people
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.680]   and people who are a little older
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   who aren't really prepared for retirement.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.400]   I'm trying to help them.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   Can I include some of your blog posts?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.320]   And this was a retired gentleman named John,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.480]   really nice guy.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.300]   And I said, sure.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.880]   And I kind of drew up a email correspondence,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   friendship with this guy.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.080]   We became email pen pals, basically.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.960]   And older guy, and he decided,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   he said, can I send you my strategy
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.120]   for asset allocation in retirement?
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.160]   I want to see what you think.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   And I, sure, let's have at it.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.040]   So he sent it to me and he called it the four-year rule.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.120]   So he had his own rule of thumb, right?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.320]   And it went something like this.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.880]   And this is for someone who's in retirement.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.680]   And he said, this is the strategy I use
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.760]   for spending down my assets and setting my asset allocation.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.520]   He said, before retirement,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.960]   I accumulated four years worth of cash that I kept in,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   money market CDs, some sort of cash equivalent,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.560]   savings account, whatever.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.040]   The rest is held in stocks.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.940]   And then when I retire, if the market's up,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.240]   I'm taking no money for spending from stocks.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.160]   If the market's down, I'm taking from the cash portion.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.960]   And then if we get back into a bull market,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.160]   I'm replenishing that cash
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.720]   and getting it back to four years
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.760]   and then sort of going from there
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.960]   and using that as the heuristic, right?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680]   And obviously, there's more give and take to that.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.560]   That's the gist of it.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.440]   And the thing I liked most about John's strategy
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.480]   is that he reverse engineered the problem, right?
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.520]   He started with his goal in mind,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.360]   and then he figured out
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.560]   that's going to lead to the asset allocation.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.200]   Now, some people could look at this and say,
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.280]   well, that's way too conservative.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   You don't need that much in cash.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.920]   Or some people could say, that's not conservative enough.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.640]   I need more there.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.600]   So the point is, it depends on your risk profile.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.120]   And I was reminded of John's strategy this week
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.960]   for the first time in a while,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.160]   because sadly, his wife informed me
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.480]   he had an incurable disease and he passed away recently.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.320]   - Oh. - Really nice guy.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah. - Oh no, RIP.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.120]   - Anyway, wanted to give him a shout out.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   One of the nicest guys I've interacted with.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.280]   And I posted this on my blog in 2014,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.880]   and I posted his four-year rule.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.480]   And I still to this day get people asking,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.320]   can you send it to me?
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.000]   'Cause he gave me his whole rundown on it anyway.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.960]   So anyway, really nice guy.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.680]   One of the nicest people I've interacted with
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.680]   for all my contacts I've had with people on the blog.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.880]   So back to the original question about this rule.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.760]   I've never heard of the rule
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.560]   about multiplying by the bond interest rate.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.320]   My worry there, it kind of makes sense, I guess.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.280]   My worry there is that it's very volatile.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.080]   So if you did that this year,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.720]   you start off the year at 10% bonds,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.280]   'cause rates were 1% if you're using the 10-year.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.240]   Now rates are at 4%, you're up to 40%.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.720]   What happens if they scream higher to six?
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.480]   You go to 60, or they go back to two,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.320]   you go back down to 20.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   It seems like, I guess you're thinking there
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   as you're using valuations, but it's very volatile.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.320]   So you mentioned Bogle's rule.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.680]   He said the age that you're at is how much you have in bonds.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.960]   So if you're 25 years old, you have a 75% stock, 25% bond.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.840]   If you're 65, it's 35% stock, 65% bonds.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.520]   Some people have said you could also subtract 10 or 20
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.280]   from that using a starting point.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.120]   It's a pretty decent rule of thumb.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.400]   I think my way of thinking about this is there's no
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.080]   such thing as a perfect asset allocation for anyone.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.280]   There's a lot of factors.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.720]   You have to figure out where you're at in your life cycle.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.240]   Are you accumulating assets in your 20s and 30s?
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.440]   Are you mid-life like us?
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.040]   I hate to break it to you, Bill, but we're in our 40s.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.880]   It's weird, right?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.400]   - I think about that every morning, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.720]   - We're in the weird stage of life
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.840]   where we've accumulated assets.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.000]   So we're doing way better than we were in our 20s.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   We're making more money.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.800]   So we have these financial assets,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.120]   and it stings a little bit when we get into bear market.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.680]   But we're also, we have a few decades left
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.040]   until we're gonna retire, hopefully.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.480]   But we're also like, we see this faint little light
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.760]   at the end of the tunnel of retirement.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.840]   It's like, oh, it's not like four decades away anymore.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.160]   It's a couple decades potentially.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.120]   So you're in that weird balance phase, right?
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.360]   I think that's a strange one to be in.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.640]   - Yeah, I had an advisor today in our group
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.440]   throughout thinking about retirement.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.960]   I think it's just 'cause he had a rough week,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.440]   and I was thinking, man, you're not ever retiring
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.240]   this fancy or the other.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   No, but I think back to the question,
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   like what I like about your answer, Ben,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.360]   like let me throw this at you.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240]   It probably doesn't matter what your heuristic is
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.080]   as long as you have something that you can stick with,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.520]   right, that obviously works for you.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.760]   So yeah, I don't like that volatile,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.240]   like using the interest rate, right?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.800]   'Cause how do you adjust for inflation, et cetera?
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.640]   But no, I think that's a great answer.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.480]   - Yeah, it moves around a lot.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.920]   And like the most subjective factor of all
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   is your behavior, right?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.480]   'Cause there are things in your life,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.920]   whether they're world events or things that happen
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.240]   in your personal life that are gonna impact your behavior
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.680]   in ways that you have no idea,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.600]   that you just can't predict them ahead of time, right?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.960]   And so I think, to your point,
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.040]   that the right asset allocation
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.120]   is the one you can stick with come hell or high water.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.120]   And this is a pretty good time
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.640]   to understand what that could be.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   So I always think that like the good strategy
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.520]   you can stick with is vastly superior
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.400]   to the great strategy you can't stick with.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   And I just think you just have to figure out
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.920]   what's the one that's gonna give you
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.120]   the highest probability of reaching your goals
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.960]   that also balances out like the emotional
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.720]   and financial strain of seeing losses.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.000]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.080]   Great answer.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.400]   - Cool, let's do the next one.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.240]   - Awesome.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.760]   All right, question two for Ben.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.800]   I am 28.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.080]   Like many people my age,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.640]   I got caught up in the SPAC craze of 2021,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.440]   those heady days of last year.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.000]   At that time, I thought to myself, I'm young.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.200]   My Roth IRA is worth about 33,000.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.360]   I should speculate now while I can still afford
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.720]   to lose a few bucks and make up for it later.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.200]   So about half the portfolio goes to SPACs
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.240]   and the other half in ETFs.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.120]   Fast forward today, I've lost 40% year to date
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.400]   on those SPAC bets.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.320]   A couple of tickers there in the chart,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.760]   you can look it up on YouTube.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.120]   And I'm down about 7% from the cost basis of my ETFs.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   So in total, my portfolio is down 23% from cost basis.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   I've seen stats that you've shared
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.760]   about one year, three year, five year average returns
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   from the market bottom and bear markets.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.280]   Given them, I won't need the money for a long time.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.840]   Should I just cut my losses on the speculative side
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.800]   and plow that cash in ETFs?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.200]   Not to brag, but I can't continue investing my Roth
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.800]   starting in 2023 due to hitting the income limit.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.640]   So good for you.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.000]   That's about $128,000 individuals, about $180,000 joint.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.680]   I still believe in one of those companies
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.000]   could kill it the next three to five years,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.640]   but I'm trying to be a level head investor.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.440]   Help me, Adam.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.280]   - All right.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   I think the first question is like, okay, that's fine.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.120]   You still believe, but is 50% really
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   the right asset allocation here for SPACs?
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   Not gonna lie that I don't have a 50% allocation to SPACs.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.080]   That seems a little on the high end to me.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.680]   So I think figure out a more reasonable level
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.880]   of what you think the SPAC could be.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.680]   And you still wanna let these run a little bit
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.960]   if on the off chance that some of them end up doing well.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.680]   But could you do that from 10 or 20% maybe
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.080]   and not 50% of your portfolio?
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.640]   Because the whole thing is like
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.600]   the regret minimization framework is
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.800]   how am I gonna feel if I'm wrong
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.480]   and these stocks continue to get hammered
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.640]   versus how will I feel if I'm right
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.840]   and some of these work out.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.320]   If some of these work out spectacularly
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.800]   over three to five years and you have a smaller allocation,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.080]   it's still probably gonna be a big help to your portfolio,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.960]   even if it's more like 10% of your allocation.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.520]   But what's the tax stuff here?
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.640]   I know he can't do the Roth anymore
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.800]   because he's making more money,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.480]   but what's the tax side of things here?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.840]   - Yeah, I was gonna,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.960]   my point was actually not gonna be tax related, Ben.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.280]   It was just gonna be like the losses are the losses, right?
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.840]   I mean, they're in the rear view mirror, they're done.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.440]   So like, I think it's this investor problem
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   where we always anchor to our purchase prices
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.560]   if that matters.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.280]   I think you hit the right point is that
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.880]   do you wanna be this lever to SPACs?
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.400]   Ben, do you have any idea what the market cap is of SPACs?
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.600]   Like just as a, is that an asset class?
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600]   Like what do you even call that?
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.680]   I have no clue.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.440]   - It's gotta be pretty small.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.880]   So yeah, that's a good point
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.440]   that like the overweight here is enormous.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.880]   And your point about the losses,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   stocks are down this year and bonds are down this year.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.320]   So this is the kind of thing where
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   if you want to have a get out of jail free card
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.160]   from your portfolio, you could basically start over
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.120]   because you have the losses.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.920]   So it's kind of like, okay, free and clear.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.440]   If you had 100% cash today, what would you do?
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.520]   What would your portfolio look like?
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.800]   And would it still really look like this
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.320]   with SPACs that are down 40, 50%?
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.200]   Would it still look like that?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.440]   Or are you just using the anchoring bias
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.280]   where you wanna get back and break even?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   So I think that's the kind of thing where you start
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.040]   and you go, okay, what if I started from ground zero today?
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.720]   And you can, because you have those losses
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.600]   to use potentially, would you have this same portfolio?
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   And a lot of people probably wouldn't say yes.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   - Yeah, I think that's great.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.760]   And 40% SPAC losses,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.480]   that makes the cryptocurrency position
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.280]   look like a bargain right in the grand scheme of things.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.720]   Like FTX investors are calling, they want these SPAC losses
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.600]   'cause ultimately that is a chance to recover.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.440]   But no, but I think that's it.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.360]   And I think you hit the point is that,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.480]   do you still believe in this investment now?
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.840]   My other thing, Ben, just correct me if I'm wrong here,
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.280]   like you kind of have to be all in
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.720]   on these volatile investments or not.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.800]   Like you can't let the like one year of volatility
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.320]   make or break your decisions here
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.240]   because you're just always gonna sell when they decline.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.760]   Right, and you're always gonna hold when they--
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.080]   - And if that one year can make or break your decisions,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.320]   then you're obviously too overweight there.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.080]   Yeah, right size the ship.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.440]   I don't know, if you speculate with 5% of your portfolio
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.160]   and it turns out to be a grand slam,
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.800]   it's still gonna be such a meaningful amount
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.240]   that you're gonna be fine.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.080]   - Yep, yep.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.920]   So I would argue, Adam, at age 28,
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.400]   you just paid some tuition to the market to learn a lesson.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.320]   And ultimately, yeah, if you still believe
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.160]   in these companies, I would argue now is not the time,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.560]   but I wouldn't look at the loss that happened
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.400]   and let that drive your decision going forward
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.840]   'cause what happened is over
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.640]   and the future is not just unknown, it's unknowable.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.040]   - Yeah, all right, next question.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   - So this question from Michael for Ben.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.360]   A little curious here, a big fan of everything you do.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.920]   Peloton is a pretty common topic of conversation
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.400]   and I look forward to their earnings.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.720]   So Michael can be in complete shock to how the stock reads.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.680]   My question is, what do you think about Netflix
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.800]   buying them, them being Peloton?
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.120]   No FTC concerns, adding that subscription tiers
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.520]   easily integrated and they can start having workout videos
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.680]   in separate session on their platform.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.280]   My wife does most of her home workouts
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.640]   based on some YouTube videos
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.360]   and she would be all over this.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.720]   Am I crazy thinking that this has been overlooked
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.360]   and could be a slam dunk for Netflix?
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.040]   With love, Michael.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.240]   - All right, I'm not really an M&A expert here,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.520]   but Ben's rule of thumb when it comes to all things fitness.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.360]   Every exercise routine and diet at some point
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.160]   is going to end up being a fad.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.480]   And that's like the biggest reason I never,
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.680]   I'm not trying to pat myself on the back,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.400]   but that's a bigger reason I never really bought the,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.240]   thought to buy the stock,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.440]   even though I really enjoy the product.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.200]   I use the product, the Peloton product all the time.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.160]   And I think that the reason is a lot of people
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.600]   use the analogy that personal finance
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.200]   and staying fit physically is a very good analogy
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.040]   for the same thing, right?
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.520]   They're both simple, but not easy, right?
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.840]   To stay fit, you eat healthy
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.760]   and you exercise on a regular basis.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.800]   And then to build wealth, you spend less than you earn
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.000]   and you invest the difference, right?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.280]   It's simple, but not easy.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.760]   But I've used this analogy before, it's a great one,
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.400]   but I've come around to the idea that like,
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.600]   I kind of disagree with it now
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.960]   because you can automate a lot of your finances, right?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.640]   You can automate your contributions,
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.440]   you can automate your rebalancing, tax loss harvesting.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.120]   When you make sales, all this stuff,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.440]   you can automate so much of it
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.920]   and get it out of sight, out of mind,
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.960]   which I think is one of the best ways
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.720]   for the majority of people to invest their money.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.880]   Staying physically fit requires you to actually put it,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.320]   do it day in and day out, right?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.720]   You have to choose what you eat every day.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.560]   - You have to put the work in.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.120]   - You have to actually like get changed in the gym,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.160]   start working out, go running, whatever.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.120]   You actually have to do it.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.240]   So you have to make all those little decisions.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.640]   So that's my end of diatribe on personal finance
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.240]   versus staying physically fit.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.880]   But the wreckage in Peloton stock is just a sight to behold.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.960]   John, do a chart on of the coming up the drawdown.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.160]   So it's like 95% from the high.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.200]   Show the next one, which is just the market cap,
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.280]   which was close to $50 billion in January of 2021.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.920]   Now it's more like $3 billion.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.480]   Just a massive destruction of wealth.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.280]   My favorite line from Peloton is the former CEO says,
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.480]   "I see this as clear as day.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.680]   "This thing is going to be one
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.080]   "of the few trillion dollar companies in 15 years."
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.720]   And he said his board told him to stop saying that
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.840]   'cause they said eventually you're gonna sound like an idiot
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.000]   and obviously he did.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.120]   It does feel like they could be a prime takeover candidate
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   because of the technology, they have the recurring revenue.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.080]   People pay them, I don't know,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.640]   it's like 40 or 50 bucks a month for the classes.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.400]   I guess it would be interesting
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.840]   if Netflix had a Peloton channel.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.140]   You could watch Netflix at the same time
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.280]   as you're working out.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.400]   I don't know, this would be a shift
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.080]   from software to hardware for Netflix.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.200]   I kind of also think like Apple and Nike
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.520]   make a lot of sense here.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.880]   But I guess this is kind of one of the fun things
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.680]   about bear markets is you can start thinking about this.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.320]   Unfortunately, I feel like most of the good takeover ideas
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.240]   that people have never come to fruition, unfortunately.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   - Yeah, and good point about bear markets
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.480]   providing opportunity.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.280]   I just keep thinking of the Lindy principle.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   Are you familiar with this Lindy thing, Ben?
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.040]   Does that ring a bell at all?
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.000]   - Yes, all the cool kids say it these days.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.040]   - Yeah, and I think it died.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.360]   Well, the idea is stuff that lives for a long time,
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.180]   thousands of years is permanent.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.080]   So like walking is something that's been with us
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.440]   for all of human history.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.800]   Beer and wine are good
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.560]   because they've been around for a while.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.380]   And yeah, that's my thing about any exercise
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.480]   is that it's fats.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.160]   I think even the subscription service models
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   are just really, Matthew Ball's thing
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.840]   is the repackaged, packaged ideas
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.120]   that comes up with Derek Thompson from time to time, right?
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.760]   That we're just re-bundling the bundles
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.480]   that were de-bundled a year ago.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.080]   And it would be really interesting to me
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.840]   if Netflix becomes this new cable service provider.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.360]   You get your work out there along with everything else.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.200]   - I do think the biggest problem
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.280]   for seeing some of these takeovers,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.400]   and we have stocks that are down 90,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.680]   like there's a ton of stocks down 90% and you go,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.120]   why wouldn't these companies all just start
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.920]   getting taken over by the war chest of cash
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.120]   that tech stocks have?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.280]   Well, all these huge tech companies are laying people off
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.840]   because they think a recession is coming.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.040]   And are you really gonna buy another company
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.800]   if you think there's potentially another leg down?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.720]   So that's, I mean, I thought in 2008,
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.040]   we were gonna see a ton more takeovers and mergers
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.880]   from the bank.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.040]   I mean, there's a few banks that got taken out,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.160]   but not nearly as many as I thought at the time.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.680]   And I think that's just because a lot of people
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.160]   don't wanna sell at the bottom unless they really have to.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.960]   You have to be forced into it, basically.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.520]   - Right, right.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   But from crisis comes opportunity.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.320]   - Yeah, not a bad idea though, Peloton and Netflix.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.160]   I like it.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.560]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.160]   - Okay, question four.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   My wife is a high-income physician, not to brag,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.200]   and I make no money and stay at home with our daughter.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.640]   Our finances are in great shape,
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.880]   thanks to advice from folks like you.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.040]   My parents are both 65, recently retired,
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   and live with us in a separate in-law suite.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.480]   They cover the electric bill
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.160]   and they help out with the baby.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.760]   Their expenses are fully covered by Social Security.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.800]   They have about $200,000 in 401ks
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.520]   and about $120,000 in checking.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.720]   Unfortunately, they know nothing
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.840]   about where to put that money,
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.200]   and they think that they can beat inflation
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   by putting money under the mattress.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.320]   How should I propose to allocate their money for them
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.920]   in a simple, low-risk way, 30% stocks, 70% bonds?
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.120]   If I can't explain it in a few sentences,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.520]   they'll just use the mattress.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.360]   Sam.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.480]   - Okay, the other not to brag here
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.160]   is he's got free babysitters all the time.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.520]   - That's what I was gonna say.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.360]   - Right? - It's a dream.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   - That's why I'm, that's like the one thing
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.360]   you have to have your parents live with you.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.840]   On the other hand, you got free babysitting.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.840]   - It's a dream for middle-aged dads, yeah.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.800]   - Yes, that's the, and kudos to you
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.720]   for staying home with your daughter
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.560]   and letting her wait for it.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.480]   - I think that's awesome.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.200]   - I do too.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.520]   So, I think giving advice to a family member
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.080]   is 10 times harder than giving advice
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.000]   to like a prospective client in wealth management.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.320]   You may, I don't know if you agree with me there.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.040]   It's very difficult because if something goes wrong,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.800]   they're probably gonna blame you.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.200]   But obviously, like your parents need to do something.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.600]   Right?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.440]   Maybe.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   It says they're living with you.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.800]   They pay the electric bill.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.640]   That's about it.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.600]   They're paying utilities.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.240]   So obviously, their cost of living expenses are low,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.340]   so they can be covered by social security.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.600]   What do you do with, in this situation?
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.040]   I guess now makes it a little easier
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.760]   where they don't have to take a ton of risk
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.600]   if they don't want to
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.080]   because interest rates are now higher.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.400]   So, do you like tone the water into, you know,
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.480]   just some really low volatile short-term bonds,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.520]   money market CDs, that stuff,
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.680]   so at least earning something?
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.940]   - Yeah, that's where I was gonna go.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.080]   But I guess to hit your point, Sam,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.720]   if you, I think the first thing is
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.000]   that you would need to sort of gain some trust, right?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.180]   And ultimately, if whatever plan you give them goes wrong,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.600]   you've potentially not just lost your in-laws,
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.680]   you've lost, or your parents, you've lost a babysitter.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.040]   And so, and a roommate.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.840]   So nobody wants that.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.280]   But I think I would move beyond that
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.640]   and just sort of think about this
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.580]   from a financial planner standpoint.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.400]   I think, like layer one would be,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.240]   probably want to hire somebody
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.440]   to professionally help them, right?
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.920]   To give them advice.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.160]   But assuming that they would listen to you, Sam,
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.680]   the thing I would think about is,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.600]   yeah, I think, Ben,
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.200]   the market's given us a massive gift here this year.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.420]   If you go back and look at, let's say,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.360]   the one-year treasury or six-year treasury,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.680]   just pick your duration.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.060]   A year ago, we were talking like 0.1%, right?
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.880]   And today, you can get close to 4% a year
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.560]   of state income tax-free U.S. treasury interest,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.400]   and the market defines that more or less
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.600]   as a risk-free rate.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.960]   And so, you mentioned it at the top,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.420]   inflation 7%, that stinks.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.840]   But I would sort of frame this as,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.440]   the first step for any financial person
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.660]   would be do no harm.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.280]   And if they're mostly in cash
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.160]   and assuming they're conservatively managed 401ks,
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.400]   I would just start easy.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.680]   And if you can get 4% from a simple allocation
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.480]   of treasury bonds, I'd start there
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.220]   and then start layering things on top of that,
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.800]   because that would get them
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.080]   to start to think about inflation on the long run
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.060]   and then maybe put a plan in front of them and say,
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.960]   hey, if your spending can't keep up with inflation,
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.180]   your expenses are covered now,
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.960]   what happens when the medical expenses increase, right,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.840]   in the future?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.120]   What happens if we want to take some vacations
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.960]   and do some time?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.240]   Ultimately, I think that I would sit them down
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.740]   and try to talk about their goals,
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.160]   but I think the market's given us a gift
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.000]   and I would just start
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.520]   with something relatively conservative.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.040]   Rates are high, why not just get started there?
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.400]   - Do you think people actually put money
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.160]   under their mattress anymore?
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.040]   I know it's a saying,
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.800]   but is that someone actually doing this?
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.600]   - I don't have kids that have lost teeth yet,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.620]   but apparently I do need to start thinking about this.
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.240]   There are fairies involved,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.200]   but I would say no, ultimately.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.560]   But it is nice to see yield come back.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.640]   Like, I get excited right now, right?
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.880]   - Especially for fairies.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.720]   I know people say like,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.000]   well, it's still below the rate of inflation,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.280]   but so what?
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.800]   It's better than nothing.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.960]   It's so much better.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.120]   Also, the tooth fairy thing,
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.560]   my daughter lost a bunch of teeth right in a row.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.400]   - I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.920]   You should have seen the other girl.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.840]   - Oh yeah, well no, she had the two front teeth gone
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.400]   and just a huge gap.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.960]   But so she lost a tooth
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.760]   and my wife only had a $20 bill and we forgot, you know?
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.800]   So we put a 20 under there,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.680]   which is way more than you should.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.560]   And the next day she lost another one.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.920]   So then she expected another 20, right?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.820]   So.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.660]   - Thanks Biden.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.400]   Yeah, there's inflation right at you.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.240]   Stick it.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.680]   - I think I may have reused the same 20.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.560]   - Cost of living adjustments for the tooth fairy
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.680]   are out of control these days.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.600]   It's nuts.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.440]   - Seriously.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.920]   All right, we got one more question.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.520]   - All right, question five.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.640]   We moved our joint account and rollover and Roth IRAs
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.720]   from an advisor to a self-managed account.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.400]   We are a military family, big shouts, big ups,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   and our advisor is not able to advise us
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.040]   in the current state we live in.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.520]   I'm now managing my rollover IRA
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.600]   and I want to rebalance into a blend of index funds
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.920]   from individual stocks.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.960]   From many of the stocks,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.160]   it was easy to sell because they were up.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.480]   The question I has is what should I do
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.600]   with the others that have had major losses?
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.320]   I'm not sure if I should hold these for a while
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.560]   and wait for them to come up
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.000]   or just rip the Band-Aid off with 29% losses.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.080]   I am 40, my husband's 44,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.280]   so we have a long time horizon before we retire,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.120]   but with some of the stocks,
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.000]   I'm worried they just might continue to drop.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.440]   Dicks, a couple of companies that she mentions.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.480]   A question comes from Sarah.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   So Ben, what should Sarah do with her individual stocks?
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.040]   - First, so she's a military family.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.920]   Any special considerations here because of that?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.760]   - I mean, just number one, first and foremost,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.720]   thank you, that's awesome.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.720]   I mean, the question that Duncan had was,
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.640]   are there advisors that can work with folks
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.600]   in different states, right?
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.960]   Because ultimately if your advisor is from one home state
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.480]   and it really depends on the advisor, right?
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.240]   We happen to be registered SEC wise.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.400]   But no, I think that the concerns and sort of tribulations,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.000]   the challenges that face military families
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   are very similar to everybody else.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.240]   Hopefully there's a military pension involved,
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   but ultimately I give Sarah a lot of credit
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.080]   because she's thinking long-term
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.960]   and she's looking to invest for the future.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.440]   So I think that advice would stand military or not.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.080]   And I give her a lot of credit for thinking about that.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.240]   - Right, but I think like, again,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.920]   if you know that you have a portfolio
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.560]   that you wanna get to someday,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.640]   the ripping a bandit off makes the most sense to me,
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.880]   especially in an environment like this,
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.480]   and especially if you're using tax deferred accounts.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.320]   You know, in the back of our heads, we're always thinking,
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.640]   well, what if I'm selling Amazon that was down 90%
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.480]   or whatever, and it's come back to be
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   one of the greatest stocks of all time?
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.200]   There's always going to be that in the back of your head.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.160]   But I think if you have a portfolio that you wanna get to,
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.320]   I don't see the need to wait,
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.000]   unless you're thinking through something like taxes
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.440]   or costs or something like that,
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.160]   that is gonna be prohibitive.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.520]   And if it's not, then I think you just do it
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.640]   because the longer you wait,
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.840]   the better the chance of something potentially going wrong.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.720]   And I think that this year's a great example of,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.080]   I'm always preaching the benefits of diversification,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.680]   but this year shows if you have concentrated investments
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.880]   in the wrong area of the market,
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.440]   and you got in at the wrong time, you can be crushed.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.760]   I mean, certain people are sitting,
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.000]   certain people feel their portfolio
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.520]   is like a depression right now, right?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.720]   - It could be down 60, 70, 80%
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.760]   if you put all of your money in the wrong stuff,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.400]   whereas the market itself is down,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.440]   the Dow is down 7% this year, the S&P is down 15.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.600]   You know, that diversification is,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.920]   especially in times like these,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   I don't think you can calculate
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.800]   how much better it makes people feel.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.160]   - Yeah, the key to me was companies
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.440]   I've never heard of, right?
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   So if you have a stock or a company in your portfolio
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.200]   that you've literally not taken the time to research,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.360]   it probably has no place in your portfolio.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.640]   Sarah mentions in the question,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.080]   just clarified it reading it through,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.400]   that she's looking at a role of IRA, right, Ben?
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.760]   So within an IRA, if you sell a stock, a company at a loss,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.840]   there's no tax effect.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.120]   So like the only reason you would hold something in an IRA
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.080]   would be if you expect long-term growth.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.720]   And I would say for a Dick's
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.160]   or one of these companies that she mentions,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.620]   or you mentioned Amazon, Ben,
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.280]   if you have a diversified index fund,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.360]   you're gonna enjoy the future appreciation
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.600]   of a company like that,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.880]   especially a company that has a large market cap.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.740]   So I would just, again, the losses are in the past.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.720]   They're done, they're over with.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.760]   You can't do anything about them.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.640]   So like, don't let that dictate your decisions going forward.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.880]   What's the portfolio you want?
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.240]   How do you wanna make this stick?
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.160]   And I think a blend of index funds is a fantastic way to go
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.040]   for any investor, military or not.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.680]   - And we've gotten questions like this a lot recently,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.900]   obviously, and it just shows how quickly
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.760]   the sentiment has changed from a couple of years ago
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.600]   of people wanting to be,
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.720]   "I wanna be in triple lever to this and I can handle it,"
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.760]   to, "No, now I've seen individual selection."
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.760]   I think that this is a lesson
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.000]   sometimes that you have to learn.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.420]   Like, sometimes people will scold you and say,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.640]   "You shouldn't take so much risk
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.480]   when market's growing up."
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.680]   And that's the last thing that you want to hear
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.840]   because you're seeing everyone else get rich
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.600]   and you have FOMO and all these things.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.400]   And I think if you,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.160]   this is the time to understand and learn your risk tolerance.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.240]   Maybe some people can have a concentrated portfolio
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.940]   and can have 50 or 60% of their portfolio in this.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.000]   And if you can handle that and you can do the work
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.800]   and you understand these stocks, that's fine.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.040]   But if you're someone who's just kind of willy-nilly,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.840]   like, "I liked these stocks and I put money in them
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.340]   because they were going up,"
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.720]   and you don't have a plan on the other side
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.920]   for when am I gonna sell them
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.100]   and when is the business turnaround
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.520]   and what's the difference between a good business
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.720]   and a good stock,
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.660]   or potentially now a bad business and a bad stock,
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.280]   this is your out.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.360]   This is the time to reassess and understand,
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.320]   "Okay, this is my true risk profile.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.920]   And now I actually understand.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   And I'm gonna build a portfolio that I can stick with
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.940]   through bull markets and bear markets
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.720]   and not just when things are going up."
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.000]   - Yeah, and the data on your side.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.920]   John, can we pull up the chart that I put up?
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.580]   So this is a study.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.320]   It was a 25-year sample period, '83 to 2007,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.720]   where some gentleman from Blackstar Funds,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.160]   they renamed him a couple of times to Longboard,
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.360]   they're still in existence.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.020]   But this chart is burned into my brain.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.040]   And they took a look at not just the stocks
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.480]   in the Russell 3000,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.760]   but every stock that had been in an index,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.220]   in that index for a 25-year period.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.280]   And you can see the distributions of returns here
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.860]   relative to the index.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.120]   Only 36% of the universe of stocks
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.560]   outperformed the index during that time period,
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.460]   with fat tails on either side.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.560]   So just in a random sample in a Burton Malkiel,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.240]   monkey throwing dart scenario, you pick 100 stocks,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.080]   the data show that about two thirds of those
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.180]   are gonna perform the index.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.360]   And this to me is the triumph of indexing,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.480]   that you don't have to pick the winners and losers.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.320]   It doesn't matter if you get the right ones right or wrong.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.600]   It's the capitalism distribution that matters.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.200]   And you will enjoy the next Amazon,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.680]   the next Microsoft, the next Google,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.580]   if you have a broad enough portfolio.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.580]   And if you're paying basis points
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.060]   to outsource that management, that decision-making,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.100]   you're probably coming out ahead
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.040]   relative to trying to do it yourself.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.780]   - And I'm fine with people speculating
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.180]   as long as you right-size it.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.820]   There's nothing wrong with wanting to pick stocks
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.380]   and pick, like I like paying attention to stuff.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.460]   I have a fun portfolio at Robinhood that I pick stocks with.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.060]   It's gotten destroyed this year.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.100]   I have one boomer stock that pays dividends,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.060]   that's doing okay.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.140]   Everything else has gotten mangled for the last 18 months.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.060]   - Yeah, I got that all out of my system two recessions ago.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.480]   - I right-size, it's like five or 10% of my portfolio.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.220]   It's fun money.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.600]   It's kind of over here.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.340]   And then everything else is on autopilot
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.160]   and everything else is not being touched.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.000]   And that's the idea.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.580]   And I think people just have learned
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.840]   it's time to right-size this stuff.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.520]   And I think this is the time that you do that.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.360]   - Yep, I agree.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.500]   So best of luck, Sarah.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.560]   Thank you very much for you and your husband's service.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   We appreciate your service to our great country.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.640]   And just send us a quick email
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.760]   if there's anything we can help you with.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.720]   We appreciate it very much.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   - Yes, so thanks for hopping in here, Bill.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.640]   - Yeah, it was great.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.480]   Where's the music?
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.040]   We need the tunes back.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   John, I was about to start beat boxing.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.280]   - Duncan will be back.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.720]   We have some holidays coming up.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.080]   So we'll have some days we're not on
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.480]   and around Thanksgiving and Christmas maybe, but-
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.320]   - Two weeks.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.140]   - Duncan will be back.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.200]   Yeah, we're getting there.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.840]   I'm already ready to tell people
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.160]   circle back in the new year.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.840]   - Already, right?
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.660]   - I don't know.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.500]   We've got some runway.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.600]   We've got some work to do, Ben, between now and 1231.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.680]   - If you're listening to this in podcast form,
