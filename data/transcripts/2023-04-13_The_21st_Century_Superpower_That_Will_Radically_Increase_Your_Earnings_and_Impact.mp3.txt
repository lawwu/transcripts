[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.360]   My name is Josh Rasheeds, I'm your host.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.400]   Today I wanna share with you some ideas
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.240]   on the importance of cultivating a super skill
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.580]   that will lead you and your children to success.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.120]   Anybody who's been listening to the show
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.500]   in an up-to-date manner knows
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380]   that I have been going through a series
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.960]   called How to Invest in Your Children at a Very Early Age.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740]   And the basic premise of this series is simply,
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.040]   there are many things that you can do
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.000]   to invest into your children
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.200]   so that they have a high capacity
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.680]   as they pass into adolescence and into young adulthood.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.740]   And I believe that these investments,
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.340]   these things that you can do,
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.840]   are a worthy source of our attention and of our money.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.720]   And so far I've been talking about investing
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.640]   into their bodies and investing into their minds.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.380]   And I've done, I would say half a dozen shows now
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.280]   on how to enhance the intelligence of your children.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.540]   Because if you want smart kids, you can do that.
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.760]   You can cultivate smart children.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.000]   You can cultivate intelligent children.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.240]   It's not an accident.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.320]   Whatever the baseline genetic potential
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   that your children have,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.760]   that's something that can be cultivated
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   with intentionality on your part as a parent.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.080]   But being smart is not enough.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.040]   It's not enough for you or me to simply be smart.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.000]   And it's not enough for our children to be smart.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.840]   Simply being smart will not cause your children
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080]   to be financially successful.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.780]   It will not cause your children to be successful at work.
[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.080]   There are other skills that are associated with this.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.520]   Now, while this topic is related to intelligence,
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.360]   I'm probably not gonna label this
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.800]   as connected to that series.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.120]   You feel free to listen to this
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.160]   through the eyes of investing in your children if you like.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   But I wanna talk to you, you, someone who is not a child.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.640]   Because what I'm going to share with you in this podcast
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.160]   is a core foundational,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.540]   it's a foundation of you taking the intelligence
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.940]   that you have and turning it into success.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.420]   See, this lines up with another long-held belief I have had,
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.280]   which is simply that financial products
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   don't generally cause people to be financially independent.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.520]   It's everything else that causes people
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.140]   to be financially independent.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.040]   And the financial products come in at the end of the line.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.620]   In the almost 10 years I've been doing this podcast,
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.560]   I've been saying that financial advisors
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.060]   are very good at helping rich people stay rich
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.400]   and get richer,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.760]   but they're not good at helping poor people get rich.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.320]   Quite simply, because you can't get rich
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.440]   with a financial product.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.560]   You have to get rich with work,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.280]   with income, with smart decisions.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.460]   So how do we do that?
[00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.160]   Well, you could talk about skills.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.520]   I have other podcasts devoted to developing
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.560]   highly compensated skills,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.800]   skills that the marketplace values.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   We could talk about action and activity.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.320]   That's exceedingly important.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.160]   At the end of the day,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.280]   setting goals doesn't actually cause you to be successful.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.640]   Reading doesn't cause you to be successful.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.960]   Learning doesn't cause you to be successful.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.620]   It's the application of those things,
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.140]   the activities that you do.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.620]   It's the action that matters.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.960]   If we could just only measure action and action alone,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.960]   then we would know how to cause your financial success.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   Why are people fat?
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.640]   They're not fat due to lack of knowledge.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.840]   They're fat due to lack of action,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.480]   exercise and eating habits.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.760]   Why are people poor?
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.920]   They're not poor due to lack of knowledge.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.000]   They're poor due to lack of action.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.580]   So I could aim this entire podcast in that direction,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.400]   in the direction of you, you're taking action.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.660]   And someday, maybe I will.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.880]   I have other shows on this topic.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.820]   But today I want to talk about one of those things
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.340]   that is related to intelligence
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.060]   that can either be a resource,
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.840]   a catalyst that helps you to take lots of action,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.520]   or something that keeps you from taking action.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.200]   That topic is attention span.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.960]   Your ability to pay attention
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.320]   is something that you must evaluate,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.680]   measure, and enhance or grow.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.920]   If you do everything that I've talked about
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.520]   to help your children be very intelligent,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.280]   if you do the things I have talked about
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.980]   to help you be intelligent,
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:54.000]   but you do not simultaneously exercise the discipline
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.300]   necessary to enhance attention span,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.640]   you will be limited in your actual application
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.780]   of intelligence to action.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.120]   And that's a horrific state to be in.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.480]   What a pain to go through all the work
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.080]   of developing a giant, powerful brain,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.320]   and then have that brain's output and usefulness
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.500]   limited by the inability to pay attention.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.760]   Think of it like this.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.260]   Imagine that you had access
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.240]   to a mainframe supercomputer,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.160]   running the latest, greatest AI software
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.920]   that has access to all of the resource of the internet
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.040]   at its fingertips.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.440]   And yet your ability to access that computer
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.760]   comes only through a dial-up modem.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.840]   Remember those?
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.060]   A dial-up modem.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.100]   The brain is there, the computer is there,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.240]   the computer is running great software,
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.180]   but you can't get all of the fullness of its capacity
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.120]   because you're limited to this tiny,
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.080]   horrifically slow internet connection.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.660]   You'll get something, but it's deeply limited.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:11.440]   Every step you could take up the wireless pathway
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.000]   to go from a dial-up modem to some sort of faster access,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.800]   up to a direct fiber optic connection to the computer
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.720]   through the internet,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.920]   up to directly plugging into the computer,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   speeds, speeds, speeds your ability
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.520]   and allows you to tap into the potential
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   of that massive, powerful computer.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.240]   And this is how I think of our attention span.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   Our attention span is basically the connection
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.640]   that we have to our computer.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.960]   How long can we access that computer
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.560]   and how long can we then direct it
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.240]   in the direction that we want it to go?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.400]   If you have a powerful brain,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.640]   Just like if you have a powerful computer, and you ask it a really important question,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.740]   then that powerful brain can give you a glimmer of insight or answer a question very, very
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:16.340]   quickly, but it would be better to have a tremendous connection to a less powerful computer,
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.760]   but a connection that you could just ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask,
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.440]   the best questions and get the best results out of it.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   Think like, again, think chat GPT is a great metaphor for us to use.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.200]   You could just ask it everything, and it could give you everything, and it could boom, fast,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   fast, fast.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.280]   It'd be better to have a high-speed connection to a less powerful computer than a very limited
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.960]   connection to the most powerful computer.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.120]   I think of that as like a tension span.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.600]   A guy who's got a less powerful brain, but who's cultivated the skill of paying attention
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:58.360]   and focusing on important work is the guy who will take vastly higher quantities of
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.880]   action, and the right action, because they're governed by his brain, versus the guy who
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:10.560]   can take perhaps the perfect action one time, but he's limited by his attention span.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.100]   Whenever we talk about intelligence, we have to recognize that intelligence is not everything.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.200]   Attention span, in order to take action, accounts for most of the results.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.280]   Yes, you want to take the right actions, but as we've learned ever since we were first
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.920]   told the tale of the tortoise and the hare, the guy who continues taking steps forward
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.400]   steadily, steadily, steadily, steadily, steadily wins the race compared to the guy who's the
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.160]   fastest.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   Nothing has changed.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:50.800]   In today's podcast, I want to share with you the importance of attention span, and I want
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   to highlight this, especially with a discussion on intelligence, because for the last few
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.480]   years we faced something dramatic, something new.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:07.520]   That something is that IQ seems to be falling.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.120]   Now this has been known for a number of years.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.800]   One of the earlier articles that we can read on this would come from going back to 2018,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.720]   but I'll read you in a moment an article from just the last few days.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.800]   But here's an article from ScienceAlert.com published June 13, 2018.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.640]   IQ scores are falling in "worrying reversal of 20th century intelligence boom."
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.720]   A defining trend in human intelligence tests that saw people steadily obtaining higher
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.900]   IQ scores through the 20th century has abruptly ended, a new study shows.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.360]   The Flynn effect, named after the work of Kiwi intelligence researcher James Flynn,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.800]   observed rapid rises in intelligence quotient at a rate of about three IQ points per decade
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:04.040]   in the 20th century, but new research suggests these heady boom days are long gone.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.920]   An analysis of some 730,000 IQ test results by researchers from the Ragnar Frisch Center
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.620]   for Economic Research in Norway reveals the Flynn effect hit its peak for people born
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.840]   during the mid-1970s and has significantly declined ever since.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.760]   This is the most convincing evidence yet of a reversal of the Flynn effect.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.040]   Professor Stuart Ritchie from the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.360]   study, told the Times, "If you assume their model is correct, the results are impressive
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.200]   and pretty worrying."
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.440]   The researchers sourced their data from the IQ test scores of 18-19-year-old Norwegian
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.680]   men who took the tests as part of their National Compulsory Military Service.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   Between the years 1970-2009, three decades of these young men, born between 1962-1991,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.160]   were conscripted, resulting in over 730,000 IQ test results.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:03.200]   What the results show is that a turning point for the Flynn effect occurred for the post-1975
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.240]   birth cohorts, equivalent to seven fewer IQ score points per generation.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   Pay attention.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.280]   It's not the first time we've seen this kind of dip.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.680]   Research by Flynn himself that looked at the IQs of British teenagers almost a decade ago
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.360]   observed a similar fall in test scores.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.680]   "It looks like there's something screwy among British teenagers," Flynn told the
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.320]   Telegraph at the time.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:31.560]   "While we have enriched the cognitive environment of children before their teenage years, the
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.160]   cognitive environment of the teenagers has not been enriched."
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   Although that kind of environmental attribution remains hypothetical, it's a possibility
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.880]   that's supported by the latest research, which it's worth emphasizing comes from
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.660]   just one Norwegian sample, albeit a particularly huge one.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.800]   In the new study, the researchers observed IQ drops occurring within actual families,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.000]   between brothers and sons, meaning the effect likely isn't due to shifting demographic
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.780]   factors as some have suggested, such as the dysgenic accumulation of disadvantageous genes
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.600]   across areas of society.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:10.800]   Instead, it suggests changes in lifestyle could be what's behind these lower IQs,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.100]   perhaps due to the way children are educated, the way they're brought up, and the things
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.960]   they spend time doing more and less, the types of play they engage in, whether they read
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.440]   books and so on.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.960]   It goes on to talk about other possibilities.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.040]   By the way, always be careful when you deal with IQ research, because it's very hard
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.560]   to say that IQ scores are the world's best measurement of intelligence.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.640]   For example, do they measure how good people are at taking tests, or do they measure true
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   intelligence?
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:45.020]   It's a very hotly debated area of study, and this argument or discussion is no different.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.020]   Now, that was 2018.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.220]   In a moment, I'll read you a recent article from Science Norway.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.740]   But first, I want to begin with a more recent article here.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.220]   This is published in The Hill.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.000]   The headline is "American IQs Rose 30 Points in the Last Century.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.900]   Now They May Be Falling."
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.860]   Published March 29, 2023 by Daniel de Visey.
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.940]   A new study of human intelligence posits a narrative that may surprise the general public.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.620]   American IQs rose dramatically over the past century, and now they seem to be falling.
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.100]   By the way, this new study is not the previous discussion from Norway.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.540]   Cognitive abilities declined between 2006 and 2018 across three of four broad domains
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.140]   of intelligence, the study found.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.780]   Researchers tracked falling scores in logic, vocabulary, visual and mathematical problem
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.980]   solving and analogies, the latter category familiar to anyone who took the old SAT.
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.780]   In the 12-year span, IQ scores dipped up to two points in the three areas of declining
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   performance.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.580]   Scores declined across age groups, education levels, and genders, with the steepest drops
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.900]   among younger and less educated test takers.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:04.540]   IQ scores rose in just one area, spatial reasoning, a set of problems that measure the mind's
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.060]   ability to analyze three-dimensional objects.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.960]   The study, authored by researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Oregon, appears
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.860]   in the May/June issue of the journal Intelligence.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.060]   Researchers across the globe have been tracking an apparent decline in human IQs, starting
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.740]   around the turn of the millennium.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.980]   Theories abound as to why scores are dropping, but the smart money says our cognitive skills
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:34.260]   may have plateaued, teetering into an era of intellectual lethargy.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.900]   If you want to ascribe blame, look no further than this screen.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.380]   Cognitive researchers hypothesize that smartphones and smart speakers, autocomplete and artificial
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.380]   intelligence, Wi-Fi and runaway social media have conspired to supplant the higher functions
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.740]   of the human brain.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.820]   In its quest for labor-saving tech, the world may be dumbing itself down.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.940]   "We're all getting super lazy in our cognition because it's getting super easy to do everything."
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.340]   said Ruth Karpinski, a California psychologist who studies IQ.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.460]   "We're using Waze and Google Maps to get where we need to go.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.340]   We're losing our whole sense of compass."
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.300]   The new study joins a growing body of research on something called the Flynn effect.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.420]   James Flynn, a New Zealand intelligence researcher, tracked a dramatic rise in IQ scores across
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.020]   the 20th century.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.160]   How dramatic?
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.300]   If you gave an early 1900s IQ test to a person of average intelligence in 2000, the test
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.860]   taker would rate in the top 5% of the Teddy Roosevelt-era population in cognitive ability.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.100]   "IQs rose all over the world over the course of the century about 30 points," said Robert
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.820]   Sternberg, a psychology professor at Cornell who studies intelligence.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.580]   "To give you a sense of what 30 points mean, the average is 100.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.500]   Usually, gifted would start around 130.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.700]   So we're talking about the difference between an average IQ and a gifted one."

[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.700]   See dealer for details.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.260]   Until recently, IQ scores had been rising for nearly as long as we had IQ tests.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.980]   The first tests emerged around 1905, tailored for struggling schoolchildren in France.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.860]   Then it goes on and talks more about the history.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.660]   Talks about some people thought it was nutrition, schooling, better parenting for the rising
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:44.660]   scores.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.660]   It's not necessarily known.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.060]   The article then goes on and talks about the impact of test taking and becoming just better
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.780]   at taking tests, etc.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.060]   Couple of paragraphs here from an article from PopularMechanics.com published April
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.260]   8, 2023, just last week.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.700]   American IQ scores have rapidly dropped, proving the reverse Flynn effect.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.700]   Same headlines.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.700]   A Northwestern university shows a decline in three key intelligence testing categories.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.700]   Goes on and talks about it.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.180]   But the point here is the number of people.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:21.020]   The study published in the journal Intelligence used an online survey-style personality test,
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:26.900]   called the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment Project, to analyze nearly 400,000
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.060]   Americans.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:35.260]   The researchers recorded responses from 2006 and 2018 in order to examine if and how cognitive
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.840]   ability scores were changing over time within the country.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.540]   The data shows drops in logic and vocabulary, known as verbal reasoning, visual problem
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.860]   solving and analogies, known as matrix reasoning, and computational and mathematical abilities,
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.980]   known as letter and number series.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.140]   On the flip side, however, scores in spatial reasoning, known as 3D rotation, followed
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.340]   the opposite pattern, trending upward over the 12-year period.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.100]   Now one more comment on this.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:11.900]   Let's go now to ScienceNorway.no.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.140]   This article published Tuesday, April 4, 2023.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.500]   The headline is "Our IQ is steadily declining.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.780]   Should be worried" by Bard Amundsen.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.140]   Are we scoring lower on IQ tests because of the food we eat?
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.860]   Are schools and teachers the cause?
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.300]   Or maybe computers and mobile phones?
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.800]   Or is the trend due to something completely different?
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.300]   The phenomenon of declining IQ scores was detected early in Norway.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.100]   New researchers are seeing the same trend in other countries.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.180]   The researchers don't know what's behind it.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.820]   Proposals vary widely.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:51.860]   John Martin Sundet, 81, is a psychology professor and arguably Norway's leading IQ researcher
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.460]   over many years.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.460]   When we ask him why, he answers calmly, "Does it really matter?"
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.940]   We'll come back to Sundet later.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.760]   Two other Norwegian researchers published a study in 2018 in which they established that
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:12.080]   starting with a cohort born in 1975, the IQ of young Norwegian men entering military service
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.140]   has fallen steadily.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:23.700]   Goes on and explains how they measured that because the Norwegian military has a huge
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.060]   sample set and that was where they started to see it.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.580]   Now let's talk about the newest study and the comments on it.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.380]   New study on 400,000 Americans.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.340]   Researchers discovered a few years ago that the Flynn effect had stopped.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.300]   And not only that, it had actually reversed direction in pretty well the entire developed
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.780]   part of the world.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:49.460]   Rogberg points out that Sundet and two Norwegian colleagues may have been the first to notice
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.260]   this in a study published in 2004.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.340]   The most recent major study to find a decline in IQ looked at the test results for nearly
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.620]   400,000 American adults between 2006 and 2018.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   The American researchers found the greatest decline in IQ in the youngest participants
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.300]   of both sexes ages 18 to 22.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.220]   The ability to solve problems has declined in mathematics and vocabulary.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:18.360]   Only the participants' ability for certain types of reasoning has increased.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.420]   The researchers in the USA point out that similar findings have been made in Finland,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:28.540]   France, Great Britain, Norway, Denmark, Australia, the Netherlands, and Sweden in recent years.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:33.780]   The researchers in this American study posed some possible explanations, including poorer
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.740]   schools, the food we eat, or perhaps the increased use of computer technology at the expense
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.700]   of book reading.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.620]   Still good at logical and abstract thinking.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.900]   The test that Norwegian soldiers have to take when they show up for military service is
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.620]   technically not an IQ test, but it is designed in the same way.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.720]   The test is divided into three sections.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.140]   One section involves mathematical skills, another section is vocabulary based, and the
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.900]   third section has to do with logical and abstract thinking skills.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.700]   In our 2018 project that looked at the changes in Norwegian soldiers, we only had access
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:13.020]   to the total scores based on these three tests, says Rogberg.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.340]   But analyses by Sundet, which are based on the results from each sub-test, show that
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.140]   the ability for logical and abstract thinking has remained at a high level among young Norwegian
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.660]   men.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.460]   Fixed Intelligence and Fluid Intelligence
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.880]   Mathematical abilities and vocabulary are often called "fixed intelligence", or knowledge
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.020]   that is accumulated and learned over time.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.540]   Fluid intelligence is often described as the ability for abstract thinking and analysis.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.700]   These skills involve the ability to solve problems and quickly see things in new ways.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.300]   Rogberg finds it interesting that the most abstract skills have remained at a high level.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:54.780]   He does not find it that strange to imagine that pen and paper calculation skills could
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.860]   have become weaker in recent generations of young people.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.140]   Many of them have grown up using calculators at school, and now all young people walk around
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.820]   with an advanced calculator in their pocket.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.320]   The foreign words that new generations of Norwegian soldiers continued to be tested
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.180]   on were often more common in the 1950s than today.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.420]   So maybe we shouldn't be surprised that these scores have declined as well.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.780]   Rogberg emphasizes that he is speculating, but it could be that these parts of the IQ
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.340]   tests are simply poorly adapted to today's young people.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.500]   What about TV and mobile use?
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.900]   At the same time, Rogberg does not rule out that something has changed within schools,
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.680]   or maybe with the food we eat.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.640]   We also know that people are reading fewer books, and that they would rather sit and
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.460]   watch TV or a mobile screen.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.920]   "I'm an economist, not a psychologist," he says.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.700]   But if I allow myself to speculate a little more, I think another hypothesis could be
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.540]   that today we're interested in developing different qualities in our children than what
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.800]   parents emphasized in the past, says Rogberg.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.460]   Maybe we need other cognitive abilities more than math skills now.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.340]   That goes on and talks about other aspects of it.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.660]   I made sure to read you a little bit of the controversy, to say that this is unknown,
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.860]   this is speculation, we don't know exactly how and why this is happening, blah blah blah.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:15.740]   At its core, I would be willing to place my money on the idea that a lot of what I've
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:22.020]   talked about in my series on intelligence for children is a component of that.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.500]   So what are some of the things that I have talked about and discussed of how to increase
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.740]   the intelligence of your children?
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.180]   Well, first I talked about the mind and the physical care of the mind, good nutrition.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.300]   I talked about the importance of fat, a high-fat diet for children.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.660]   We live on the backside of the low-fat revolution.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.900]   I talked about the importance of protein.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.500]   We see people, many of us live, and especially if we eat the standard American diet, very
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.220]   high carbohydrate, very low protein, and then low fat.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:57.340]   When there are fats, they're often fats from nasty seed oils and things like that.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.260]   So there's a decent chance that that's affecting our brains in some way, especially the lack
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.860]   of fat, lack of protein, not enough animal protein, too much bread, too much sugar, etc.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.500]   Maybe that's a factor.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.940]   What about movement and exercise?
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.820]   We know that movement and exercise increases the power of the brain, it increases the blood
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.060]   flow to the brain, makes it work better.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.620]   We know that, at least American children that I know, we know that they're fat and sedentary.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:28.580]   So it wouldn't be a surprise if by being fat and sedentary their brains don't work very
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.740]   much.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.580]   What about oxygen, sunshine, these other physical factors that enhance the brain?
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.260]   Well, of course, we know that a lot of cases are many of our children, unfortunately, aren't
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.260]   playing outside.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.660]   They're not playing outside in the fresh air, they're not getting lots of sunshine, their
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:48.180]   vitamin D production is low, they're sitting inside, they're pasty-skinned and fat.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.380]   So that's a problem.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.580]   What about physical or chemical trauma and the impact of that?
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.820]   Well, there's a decent chance that their lives are full of chemicals, that all these, everything
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.780]   from the plastics in the food and the microplastics to the chemicals and the cleaners and everything
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.940]   that's in our air fresheners and our candles and the...
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.940]   Who knows, right?
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.940]   Maybe that's all a factor.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.660]   It certainly could be.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.740]   What do we know about literacy in our children?
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:18.260]   Well, we know that the amount of reading that they do is substantially diminished.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:23.740]   Although they technically consume a lot of words, the absorption of literature, which
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:32.740]   leads to high vocabulary due to the infrequently used, the less common words, we know the consumption
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.340]   of literature is down.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.980]   During this series on children, I shared with you lots of evidence and articles and college
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.540]   professors noticing it, et cetera.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.980]   We know that literacy is down.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.900]   If you look at the actual test scores of reading ability for government schools, the test scores
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.020]   are horrifically bad.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.700]   So some people come through and become literate, but the test scores generally are very bad.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:28:00.740]   We know that while it may be the case that a literate person in 2023 consumes perhaps
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:09.900]   more text than somebody did in 1823 when books were less common, certainly, and more advertising
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.700]   billboards, et cetera, we know, and pay attention because I'm going to talk more about this,
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.540]   but we know that the ability to follow long form literature has dramatically decreased.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.740]   I noticed this myself when I try to read old books.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:27.260]   I am a very highly skilled reader, and it's difficult for me to read old books because
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:31.340]   my attention span, I zone out in the middle of the half page sentence.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.500]   And so if I'm a highly skilled, experienced reader, and I'm experiencing that, how much
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.900]   more are children when they have been conditioned to communicate in very short sentences?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.100]   Remember the comment that I've made about advertising literature and the fact that successful
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.620]   advertisers know they need to speak at no more than a fifth grade level and communicate
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.000]   in written text at no more than a fifth grade level for maximum effectiveness.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.740]   So literacy is down dramatically, both in the sense of actually being able to read and
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.420]   then the ability for the higher level reading.
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.860]   What about numeracy?
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.980]   We know, at least from American data, that numeracy is horrifically bad.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:17.260]   The test score results for general American students' ability and mathematical ability
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.780]   across the population is very, very bad.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:26.300]   And we know that mathematics education, that we're basically trying to do the bare minimum.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.800]   Well, I think mathematics is best viewed as a language.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.980]   And as a language, it's something that needs to be absorbed over a very long period of
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:39.620]   time with lots and lots of strenuous use in order to solve the ability to problem solve.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.380]   And we know that.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.460]   And so I would say that not only do we have bad test scores, but we have a lot of crutches
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:51.220]   that have been introduced that are making for bad outcomes.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.200]   I myself am totally opposed to the use of calculators.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.060]   And yet the use of calculators is now standard in most of our high school classrooms.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:05.660]   I am firmly persuaded that high school students should not use calculators in any regard.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.500]   If Isaac Newton can invent calculus without a calculator, then we can study what Isaac
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.480]   Newton invented without a calculator.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.760]   That slows students down.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.100]   It makes many things more difficult.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.260]   But that is not a problem.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.700]   We don't, in the same way that if we don't give, you know, and this was a, I didn't mean
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.340]   to get off on this rabbit trail.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:30.260]   It's not that calculators might not be useful in some contexts, but just like using Google
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:36.180]   Translate, it might not be useful in some contexts, but the actual forced, in learning
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.900]   a language, but the actual forced difficulty of thinking, that is why we do math.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.420]   Just like that is why we learn a language.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.840]   We have to keep our brain going and think it.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.100]   So we know that numeracy is in dramatic decline.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   What about multilingualism?
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.820]   Well, we know that multilingualism, at least in English speaking places, is down.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:03.300]   I think multilingualism is probably up in non-English native places, non-English native
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:10.820]   countries as English has become so common, but at least in England, the United States,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.660]   et cetera, multilingualism is in rough shape.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.660]   What about writing ability?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.580]   I mean, I talked about cultivating writing ability.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.620]   Unfortunately, I think there's good evidence to say that our children, broadly speaking,
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.380]   are poor writers.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.380]   Writing is hard.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.580]   They don't have enough time to do it.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.380]   There's not enough effort.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.700]   Writing by hand, all the things I talked about of really the hard thinking ability, that's
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.620]   gone because we type everything.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.460]   And so we miss out on those skills there.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:44.980]   And then we have learned to write and we teach our children to write, not at a high level,
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.260]   not highbrow literature, but for the lowest common denominator.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:53.720]   We want short, simple, fast, punchy stuff and we know that that's what's practical.
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.060]   So again, these things are changing.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:02.540]   Well, I think that this poor writing ability is often reflected in poor thinking ability.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.580]   So when I talked about writing, I said one of the reasons we write is because it helps
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.460]   teach us to be better thinkers.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:12.780]   So regardless of whether or not someone reads it, we want to write in a detailed and careful
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:16.980]   way in order to make sure that our thoughts are carefully ordered.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:24.420]   And a lot of times to carefully develop good, deep thinking, we need to write long, long
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.340]   sentences, long paragraphs, long essays, etc.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.260]   This is something I'm acutely aware of as a podcaster.
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:37.940]   The appeal of my long format podcasts is very limited in the public space as compared to
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.380]   an eight minute YouTube video or a very short TikTok video.
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.340]   And yet the depth that I'm able to deal with ideas is much deeper.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.900]   And they all have their place.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.420]   Sure, short form content has its place, but if you want to really get into your thinking,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.260]   you're going to need to write significantly.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.460]   Other things that I've talked about, art, music, often down seemingly.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.460]   Not everywhere.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.920]   Again, there's programs, but I looked at a lot of programs and I found a lot of music
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.660]   teachers trying to say, "I need to bring music into these underprivileged children and look
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.060]   at the results," etc.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.500]   Formal logic, philosophy, these things are all down.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   So is there a good chance that IQs are down for all of these reasons?
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.100]   I think so, definitely.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.260]   But we need to pay attention to this.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.480]   Now practically speaking, back to my initial analogy, what is another limiting factor in
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.480]   all of these things?
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.440]   Well, it's attention span.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.620]   Because at its core, we live in a world of paradoxes.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:47.900]   On the one hand, it's never been easier to get a world-class education than it is today.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.620]   Everything is available for free.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:59.100]   Grab a $30 smartphone, grab an $80 tablet or a computer of some kind, and you have access
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.580]   to the world's greatest literature, all for free.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:08.260]   You have access to the world's finest minds, the best math instruction, everything free.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.940]   And the paradox is, we don't take advantage of it.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.980]   What do we do instead?
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:18.020]   Well we spend our time swipe, swipe, swipe.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:25.300]   And this affects all of us, you and me included.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:32.980]   I myself have noticed over the years a significant decrease in my attention span, because in
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.620]   various forms and in various ways, I've allowed myself to become addicted to the new
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.620]   and novel.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:44.700]   And I've allowed my pretty capable brain to be dramatically handicapped due to this
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.500]   lack of attention span.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.740]   So the first part of recovery is to acknowledge that there is a problem.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:56.660]   I'm going to pick on TikTok for a moment, because I was recently reading an interesting
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.940]   article about it and I thought it was a pretty good indication.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.420]   I'm not super partisan.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.580]   I'm not trying to say that, I think people often say, "Well, I'm better than others."
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.580]   Right?
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:13.500]   Well, I'm against TikTok and your mother is against TikTok, totally against TikTok, and
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.780]   yet she's on Facebook for hours a day.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.660]   Okay, fine.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:23.820]   But I think at its core, we need to pay attention to all of these potential things that can
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.300]   diminish our attention span.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.140]   So first let's identify the problem and then I'll share with you the solution.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.460]   I'm reading here from a Substack article by Gerwinder.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.020]   This article was published in January of 2023.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.180]   It's entitled, "TikTok is a Time Bomb, the Ultimate Weapon of Mass Distraction."
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.780]   Distraction, excuse me, the ultimate weapon of mass distraction.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.500]   A little Freudian slip there.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:51.660]   And the basic point of the article that he makes that I'm persuaded is plausible from
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:58.460]   various sources is quite simply that the Chinese Communist Party uses TikTok as a form of a
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:06.580]   weapon to make Americans stupid and to polarize Americans against each other and erode the
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.020]   basic foundations of Western civilization.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.060]   I think that's a plausible theory, certainly unproven, but plausible.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.060]   But most importantly, I want to talk for a moment about this because TikTok is an extreme
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:25.540]   form of the social media phenomenon and the distractions that we all face.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.500]   From section one, the smiling tiger.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.420]   TikTok is the most successful app in history.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:37.420]   It emerged in 2017 out of the Chinese video sharing app Douyin, and within three years
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.740]   it had become the most downloaded app in the world, later surpassing Google as the world's
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.900]   most visited web domain.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.060]   TikTok's conquest of human attention was facilitated by the COVID lockdowns of 2020,
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.180]   but its success wasn't mere luck.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:58.100]   There's something about the design of the app that makes it unusually irresistible.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.080]   Other platforms like Facebook and Twitter use recommendation algorithms as features
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.180]   to enhance the core product.
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.800]   With TikTok, the recommendation algorithm is the core product.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.300]   You don't need to form a social network or list your interests or the platform to begin
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.580]   tailoring content to your desires.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:19.140]   You just start watching, skipping any videos that don't immediately draw your interest.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.500]   TikTok uses a proprietary algorithm, known simply as the "For You" algorithm, that
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.620]   uses machine learning to build a personality profile of you by training itself on your
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.420]   watch habits and possibly your facial expressions.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.680]   Since a TikTok video is generally much shorter than, say, a YouTube video, the algorithm
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   acquires training data from you at a much faster rate, allowing it to quickly zero in
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.620]   on you.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.900]   The result is a system that's unsurpassed at figuring you out, and once it's figured
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.560]   you out, it can then show you what it needs to in order to addict you.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.700]   Since the "For You" algorithm favors only the most instantly mesmerizing content, its
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.880]   constructive videos, such as how-to guides and field journalism, tend to be relegated
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.900]   to the fringes in favor of tasty but malignant junk info.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.940]   Many of the most popular TikTokers, such as Charli D'Amelio, Bella Poche, Porch, and
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.140]   Addison Rae, do little more than vapidly dance and lip sync.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.260]   Individually such videos are harmless, but the algorithm doesn't intend to show you
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.260]   just one.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.600]   When it receives the signal that it's got your attention, it doubles down on whatever
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.260]   it did to get it.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:35.440]   This allows it to feed your obsessions, showing you hypnotic content again and again, reinforcing
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.620]   its imprint on your brain.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.740]   This content can include promotion of self-harm and eating disorders, and uncritical encouragement
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.820]   of sex reassignment surgery.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.820]   There's evidence that watching such content can cause mass psychogenic illness.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.020]   Researchers recently identified a new phenomenon where otherwise healthy young girls who watched
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.820]   clips of Tourette's sufferers developed Tourette's-like tics.
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:06.060]   A more common way TikTok promotes irrational behavior is with viral trends and challenges,
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:12.220]   where people engage in a specific act of idiocy in the hope it'll make them TikTok famous.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.980]   Acts include licking toilets, snorting suntan lotion, eating chicken cooked in NyQuil, and
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.740]   stealing cars.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.580]   One challenge, known as "devious licks," encourages kids to vandalize property, while
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.860]   the "blackout challenge," in which kids purposefully choke themselves with household
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:36.580]   items, has even led to several deaths, including a little girl a few days ago.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:42.620]   As troublesome as TikTok's trends are, the app's greatest danger lies not in any specific
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:46.780]   content but in its generally addictive nature.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.260]   Studies on long-term TikTok addiction don't yet exist for obvious reasons, but based on
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.540]   what we know of internet addiction generally, we can extrapolate its eventual effects on
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.500]   habitual TikTokers.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.940]   There's a substantial body of research showing a strong association between smartphone addiction,
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.700]   shrinkage of the brain's gray matter, and "digital dementia," an umbrella term for the
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.500]   onset of anxiety and depression, and the deterioration of memory, attention span, self-esteem, and
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.220]   impulse control, the last of which increases the addiction.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.700]   By the way, I want to reread that to emphasize it, because you've probably zoned out in the
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.500]   middle of my reading you about five paragraphs, and so I need your attention again.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.220]   By the way, this is linked to some interesting research with some of these claims.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.220]   Listen carefully.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:43.540]   "There's a substantial body of research showing a strong association between smartphone addiction,
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.820]   shrinkage of the brain's gray matter, and "digital dementia," an umbrella term for the
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:55.260]   onset of anxiety and depression, and the deterioration of memory, attention span, self-esteem, and
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:59.620]   impulse control, the last of which increases the addiction."
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.020]   These are the problems caused by internet addiction generally, but there's something
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.400]   about TikTok that makes it uniquely dangerous.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:14.020]   In order to develop and maintain mental faculties like memory and attention span, one needs
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.500]   to practice using them.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.300]   TikTok, more than any other app, is designed to give you what you want, while requiring
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.540]   you to do as little as possible.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.820]   It cares little who you follow or what buttons you click.
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.700]   Its main consideration is how long you spend watching.
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.420]   Its reliance on machine learning rather than user input, combined with the fact that TikTok
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:43.820]   clips are so short they require minimal memory and attention span, makes browsing TikTok
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:50.020]   the most passive, uninteractive experience of all major platforms.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:54.140]   If it's the passive nature of online content consumption that causes atrophy of mental
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:42:00.700]   faculties, then TikTok, as the most passively used platform, will naturally cause the most
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.700]   atrophy.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.540]   Indeed, many habitual TikTokers can already be found complaining on websites like Reddit
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:12.140]   about their loss of mental ability, a phenomenon that's come to be known as "TikTok brain."
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:16.380]   If the signs are becoming apparent already, imagine what TikTok addiction will have done
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.740]   to young developing brains a decade from now.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:26.340]   TikTok's capacity to stupefy people, both acutely by encouraging idiotic behavior and
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:31.660]   chronically by atrophying the brain, should prompt consideration of its potential use
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:37.300]   as a new kind of weapon, one that seeks to neutralize enemies not by inflicting pain
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.340]   and terror, but by inflicting pleasure.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.340]   Pay attention.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:51.220]   TikTok's capacity to stupefy people, to make them stupid, both acutely by encouraging idiotic
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.060]   behavior and chronically by atrophying the brain.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.100]   Friend, don't do all the hard work for yourself and your children that we've been talking
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.340]   about and then cause it all to be undone in a few weeks with TikTok brain.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.180]   Or any brain.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:11.300]   Continuing, last month FBI Director Chris Wray warned that TikTok is controlled by a
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.500]   Chinese government that could "use it for influence operations."
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   So how likely is it that one such influence operation might include addicting young Westerners
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.820]   to mind-numbing content to create a generation of nincompoops?
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:31.140]   The first indication that the Chinese Communist Party is aware of TikTok's malign influence
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:36.640]   on kids is that it's forbidden access of the app to Chinese kids.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.740]   The American tech ethicist Tristan Harris pointed out that the Chinese version of TikTok,
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.940]   Douyin, is a "spinach" version, where kids don't see twerkers and toilet lickers,
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.940]   but science experiments and educational videos.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:56.380]   Furthermore, Douyin is only accessible to kids for 40 minutes per day, and it cannot
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.360]   be accessed between 10pm and 6am.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.580]   Has the CCP enforced such rules to protect its people from what it intends to inflict
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.020]   on the West?
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.780]   When one examines the philosophical doctrines behind the rules, it becomes clear that the
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:16.820]   CCP doesn't just believe that apps like TikTok make people stupid, but that they destroy
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.620]   civilizations.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.140]   In a later paragraph he goes on and talks extensively about some of the history and
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:37.700]   who's directing TikTok, and some of the people involved in the development of TikTok.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:44.180]   But I want to drop down a little bit later in the article.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:49.060]   As for the CCP itself, it's known to have viewed former US President Donald Trump as
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:57.180]   the "accelerator-in-chief", or more accurately, "Chuan Jianguo" – my apologies to my
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.940]   Chinese speaking friends – literally "build China" Trump, because he was perceived as
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.140]   helping China by accelerating the West's decline.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.540]   For this reason, support of him was encouraged.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:14.140]   The CCP is also known to have engaged in "jiāsù chūyī" – more directly, for instance,
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:20.140]   during the 2020 US race riots, China used Western social media platforms to douse accelerant
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.540]   over US racial tensions.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.600]   But the use of TikTok as an accelerant is a whole new scale of accelerationism, one
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.020]   much closer to Lian's original apocalyptic vision.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:37.500]   Liberal capitalism is about making people work in order to obtain pleasurable things.
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:43.580]   And for decades, it's been moving toward shortening the delay between desire and gratification,
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.620]   because that's what consumers want.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.860]   Over the past century, the market has taken us toward ever shorter form entertainment,
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:57.540]   from cinema in the early 1900s, to TV mid-century, to minutes-long YouTube videos, to seconds-long
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.060]   TikTok clips.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.460]   With TikTok, the delay between desire and gratification is almost instant.
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:08.420]   There's no longer any patience or effort needed to obtain the reward, so our mental
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.220]   faculties fall into disuse and disrepair.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.500]   And this is why TikTok could prove such a devastating geopolitical weapon.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:23.140]   Slowly but steadily, it could turn the West's youth, its future, into perpetually distracted
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.260]   dopamine junkies ill-equipped to maintain the civilization built by their ancestors.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.540]   I'm going to pause the article for just a moment.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.620]   I don't know about you, but I feel half the time like we're there.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.940]   The time I most – like we're already half there, at least – the time I most recall
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:47.180]   this was a few years ago when the footbridge at Florida International University fell down.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.260]   And if you remember this, I think I was in Florida, and so it was certainly a big thing.
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:47:01.060]   But an engineering firm is building a pedestrian footbridge across a road in Miami, I think
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.620]   with the intention of connecting basically a parking lot or a parking garage to the main
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   campus.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.620]   I've forgotten.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:15.060]   A pedestrian footbridge, a standard construction scenario, a standard thing, not a huge giant
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:21.340]   bridge across the Grand Canyon, not the world's tallest bridge, a pedestrian footbridge across
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.020]   a highway.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:28.740]   And while it's in the near-finishing stages, it's sitting there, and then one day it just
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:34.180]   collapses and crushed several cars underneath it, killed a handful of people.
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.060]   And I thought to myself, "What on earth?
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:42.780]   Have we become so incompetent that we can't build a footbridge?"
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.980]   Now clearly that's an anecdote, but for me that was a triggering point.
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.680]   And I thought, "Are we getting dumber?"
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.180]   And it sure feels like we're getting dumber in many ways.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.060]   That's mixed with incredible advancements, right?
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.540]   We choose where we focus on.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   I try to spend most of my time focusing on the advancements, on sending a man to Mars,
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.540]   etc.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.780]   But when you look back and you realize what the US space program did with handheld calculators
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:15.180]   and slide rules and sending a man to the moon, and then you look at the decline that's around
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:20.340]   us, it's hard not to notice some difference, even if we can't prove our differences.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.380]   Continuing with the article.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.260]   We seem to be halfway there already.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:30.100]   Not only has there been gray matter shrinkage in smartphone-addicted individuals, but since
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.780]   1970, the Western average IQ has been steadily falling.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:38.040]   Though the decline likely has several causes, it began with the first generation to grow
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:43.500]   up with widespread TVs in homes, and common sense suggests it's at least partly the result
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.980]   of technology making the attainment of satisfaction increasingly effortless, so that we spend
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.220]   ever more of our time in a passive, vegetative state.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.700]   If you don't use it, you lose it.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.520]   By the way, this is perfectly proven.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:04.140]   We know this in terms of muscular development and the physical with our body's muscles,
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.780]   and we know this with regard to our brain muscles.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:11.060]   If you don't use them, you will lose them.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.860]   And even those still willing to use their brains are at risk of having their efforts
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:20.020]   foiled by social media, which seems to be affecting not just kids' abilities, but
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:22.300]   also their aspirations.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:28.940]   In a survey asking American and Chinese children what job they most wanted, the top answer
[00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:37.040]   among Chinese kids was "astronaut," and the top answer among American kids was "influencer."
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.020]   If we continue along our present course, the resulting loss of brain power in key fields
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.920]   could, years from now, begin to harm the West economically.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.640]   But more importantly, if it did, it would help discredit the very notion of Western
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:57.480]   liberalism itself, since there is no greater counter-argument to a system than to see it
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.600]   destroy itself.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.440]   And so the CCP would benefit doubly from this outcome, ruin the West and refute it.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.200]   Two birds with one stone.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:11.360]   Or as they say in China, one arrow, two eagles.

[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.240]   I hope that these articles scare you a little bit.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.400]   It's interesting to me that I find myself in the position of trying to, sounding like
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.680]   the preacher wandering through the streets saying "repent."
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:51:00.200]   But it's funny that when I think back to my youth of how right so many people were, I
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.400]   just see continued evidence of their rightness.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.720]   When I was a child, I grew up with no TV in our home.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.360]   My parents just made the decision not to have a TV and I'm deeply grateful that we never
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:10.840]   had one.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.000]   To this day, we've never had one.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.400]   And obviously the concept of TV has changed in terms of how we consume stuff.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.280]   Very rarely does anybody just watch TV.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.600]   But one of the things that I observe whenever I'm around a TV is how stupid it all is.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:29.240]   And when you're not around it a lot and you walk into a house where the TV is on all the
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.800]   time and here I'm talking about broadcast television, cable TV, etc.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   It's mind-numbing.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:40.520]   I cannot watch, I can't stand listening to cable news or to just any local programming.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.120]   It's horrific.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.560]   And it comes from not being desensitized to it.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:52.400]   Well of course the same thing happens with regard to our social media consumption.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.680]   My generation and younger, we've just turned away from the TV and turned to consuming the
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.020]   same vapid content and worse on apps.
[00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:07.600]   But the argument that was always made to me, that persuaded me when I was young, is that
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.800]   TV makes you stupid for two reasons.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:20.960]   The first reason is simply TV fails to... when you watch TV you are a passive spectator.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   This is unlike doing something like listening to a book.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:29.640]   If you're listening to an audio book or listening to a podcast, your brain has to consciously
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.800]   form the mental pictures so that you can follow the story.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:38.400]   So your brain activity is higher when you listen to a book or read a book versus TV.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:44.200]   That's to say nothing of the size of the lexicon used in popular programming versus a book
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.960]   etc. or the topics covered.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   You may be going and reading a thick book about the ethics of cloning and you cannot
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.120]   even scratch the surface.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:59.780]   Even if a 60 minute documentary is done on that, you can't even begin to scratch the
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.580]   surface of what you can get out of the thinking that you have to do to think of a 400 book
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.360]   on some ethical issue or some point of philosophy etc.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.400]   So the first argument against TV is that it makes you stupid because it's a passive activity
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.200]   that's not engaging your brain in a meaningful way.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.120]   The second argument against TV has to do with the opportunity cost.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.000]   It's not so much the content on the TV that's bad, it's the fact of what you could be doing
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.960]   with the time in the time that you're watching TV.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.080]   So those things are deadly.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.600]   And that was the argument from the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s etc.
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.200]   We'll bring that forward to our modern forms of consumption.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:46.240]   Swirling through your Instagram reels or your TikTok videos or your YouTube shorts or even
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.680]   just your normal YouTube feed etc.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.280]   We have the same basic fundamental problem.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:59.640]   The content is stupid and it causes you to become stupid because it doesn't require engagement.
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:04.320]   And if you're immediately saying "Yeah Joshua but the only time I go on YouTube is because
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:09.040]   I want to learn something about finance or I want to learn how to fix my car."
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:15.920]   Yes, that does exist in the same way that TV has always been a powerful medium for learning.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:21.400]   The screen can take certain concepts that you could never effectively teach in a book
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.800]   and you can teach them in five minutes with a powerfully produced something on the screen.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.040]   But you are the exception that proves the rule rather than the other way around.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:36.480]   There are exceptions but if you believe that you can't deny the fundamental truthfulness
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   of what I'm saying.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.800]   And then the second thing is what it keeps you from doing.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:48.320]   And unfortunately TV for all of its flaws was not nearly as addictive as our modern
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.920]   swiping is.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.280]   And so we got to be super super careful and we got to help our children to avoid falling
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.140]   into these traps of becoming stupid.
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:04.520]   We cannot let all of our hard work for ourselves or for our children go away.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.920]   So what is the alternative?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.480]   How do we solve this problem?
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.880]   There may be many safeguards that you would put in place.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:18.880]   A couple of practical things would be use a screen time function on your phone or device
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:23.760]   to control the amount of time that you spend on any one particular app.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.720]   I'm familiar with the Apple screen time on the iPhone.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.420]   I'm sure there's an Android equivalent.
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.080]   If not install an aftermarket app.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.840]   And that's a useful tool.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.520]   And so you can say I want to spend X amount of minutes per day on this app.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.680]   And then when you're done it pops up and says you've reached your limit.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.920]   And you say okay and the app disappears.
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.040]   Or you can say extend it.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.040]   But you have to be intentional.
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.440]   There's a popular app.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.800]   Let me look up the name of it real quick.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:57.440]   There's an app that's been super popular these days that's called OneSec.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   As in one second.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.600]   It's a great little app that you install on your phone.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.240]   And what it does is very simple.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.800]   You tell it the apps that you're most likely to be distracted by or to click on.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.040]   You know when you're just feeling I just don't know what to do and just randomly click.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.060]   And when you click on that app it pops open a screen that just gives you a gray screen
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.440]   for one second.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.160]   And then it says are you sure you want to do this.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.300]   It says take a deep breath.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.300]   You take a deep breath.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.300]   You wait one second.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.240]   And then it says do you want to continue on.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.360]   Do you want to continue on to TikTok or Instagram or do you want to stop.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:32.440]   And you just click yes I want to continue.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:40.240]   And it just inserts that momentary decision where you take one second to breathe and then
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   make a decision.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:45.520]   Do I really want to do that or am I just mindlessly controlling.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.680]   I would encourage you to use these solutions that I have just said.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.840]   I think these are the two best.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.960]   Go into your phone for any app that you use a lot.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.280]   Even for the most positive purposes.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.240]   Notice I'm not trying to say that an app is bad or that you have to delete it from your
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.240]   phone.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:07.720]   The key question is if there's an app that is causing you trouble and is getting in the
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.040]   way of your accomplishment as a human being.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.640]   Just insert a little bit of intentionality of decision making.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:20.720]   Put a time limit on it and add the one second app so that you can just make an intentional
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.720]   decision.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.680]   Those are good strategies.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:29.400]   There are other strategies but at their core we want to be intentional about building our
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.960]   life.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.760]   Imagine where you're going to be a decade from now.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.960]   So ten years from now.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:44.200]   And imagine what you could accomplish if you were focused on accomplishment.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:54.920]   We know that over the course of the next ten years there are going to be 87,600 hours of
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.720]   your life that are going to pass.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.320]   87,600 hours.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:07.600]   Go to your screen time on your phone and look at what some of your screen time is.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:13.120]   Let's say that you spend on average five hours a week.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:18.280]   So five hours a week on an app can be the most positive thing out there.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.760]   YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, whatever.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.640]   You say this is positive.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:32.300]   Five hours times 52 weeks times ten years is going to be 2,600 hours.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:40.080]   That if you continue with this behavior over the next ten years you will invest 2,600 hours
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.040]   into this application.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:50.200]   I want you to imagine all of the good that can come from that investment of 2,600 hours
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.040]   into that app, into that activity.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.160]   Think of all the good things that can happen in your life from that 2,600 hours.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.800]   Now think of some of the other things that you could do with that 2,600 hours.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.560]   What are you giving up?
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.080]   What's your opportunity cost?
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.800]   What could you be doing with that 2,600 hours if you didn't invest it into the use of that
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.360]   app?
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.640]   You answer the question.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:28.760]   Now let's imagine a similar example or a comparative example.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:35.240]   If you work in your job a normal work week of say 40 hours per week and let's say that
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:41.800]   you do that over say a 50 week year in the US, sorry my French friends we work 50 weeks
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:44.000]   a year, just kidding.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.840]   That would be 2,000 hours.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:53.560]   2,000 hours per year is what you work if you work a full-time job.
[00:59:53.560 --> 01:00:01.840]   So at five hours per week over the course of the next ten years, if that's 2,600 hours
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:13.880]   that's more than one entire year of working a full-time job.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.960]   What could you do with that time otherwise in a way that would enhance your life?
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.220]   And here's where we pivot to this importance of the secret of success.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:31.820]   The man who is going to reach financial independence in the next ten years is not the guy, the
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:38.120]   guy that's going to fritter away five hours a week on a worthless meaningful app.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.600]   The guy who's going to reach financial independence in the next ten years is the guy who's going
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:49.040]   to take hold of that time and going to invest it in the direction that he wants to go, into
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.520]   the things that he wants to do, that he intentionally decides to do.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:07.720]   The starting point of doing this is to enhance your attention span and to do serious deep
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.280]   work.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.320]   When you're trying to get rid of something in your life, it's not enough just to say,
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.640]   "No, I don't want to do that."
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.920]   That's a starting point.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.720]   But what you have to substitute is an alternative activity.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.560]   You have to substitute something to do instead.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.920]   Now what you choose to do should come directly from your goals.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:39.280]   The activities that you do should come from the goals that are in front of you.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:47.460]   But if you would invest yourself into cultivating attention span and you would apply your attention
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.440]   span towards your goals, you will be unstoppable.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.440]   And if you will take control of your children to the degree you're capable of, and you will
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.560]   surround them with an environment where they have the chance to build their attention spans
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:10.640]   in a very intentional way and teach these things to them, they will be unstoppable.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.460]   And I am convinced that this is a central strategy that is going to make the difference
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.600]   in your life and in your finances.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:27.640]   Let me read you an excerpt from the introduction to Cal Newport's book called Deep Work.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.600]   In the Swiss canton of St. Gallen, near the northern banks of Lake Zurich, is a village
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.840]   named Bollingen.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:41.120]   In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building a retreat.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.040]   He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.520]   After returning from a trip to India, where he observed the practice of adding meditation
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.560]   rooms to homes, he expanded the complex to include a private office.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.040]   In my retiring room, I'm by myself, Jung said of the space.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.820]   I keep the key with me all the time.
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.200]   No one is allowed in there except with my permission.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:09.000]   In his book Daily Rituals, journalist Mason Currie sorted through various sources on Jung
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.520]   to recreate the psychiatrist's work habits at the Tower.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.780]   Jung would rise at 7am, Currie reports, and after a big breakfast, he would spend two
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.580]   hours of undistracted writing time in his private office.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:27.600]   His afternoons would often consist of meditation or long walks in the surrounding countryside.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:32.040]   There was no electricity at the Tower, so as day gave way to night, light came from
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.100]   oil lamps and heat from the fireplace.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.160]   Jung would retire to bed by 10pm.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.560]   The feeling of repose and renewal that I had in this Tower was intense from the start,
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560]   he said.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.800]   Though it's tempting to think of Bollingen Tower as a vacation home, if we put it into
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.680]   the context of Jung's career, at this point it's clear that the lakeside retreat was
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.520]   not built as an escape from work.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:00.080]   In 1922, when Jung bought the property, he could not afford to take a vacation.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.900]   Only one year earlier, in 1921, he had published Psychological Types, a seminal book that solidified
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:10.240]   many differences that had been long developing between Jung's thinking and the ideas of
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.680]   his one-time friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud.
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:17.120]   To disagree with Freud in the 1920s was a bold move.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.560]   To back up his book, Jung needed to stay sharp and produce a stream of smart articles and
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.360]   books further supporting and establishing analytical psychology, the eventual name for
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.400]   his new school of thought.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.520]   Jung's lectures and counseling practice kept him busy in Zurich, this is clear.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.340]   But he wasn't satisfied with busyness alone.
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:40.560]   He wanted to change the way we understood the unconscious, and this goal required deeper,
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.760]   more careful thought than he could manage amid his hectic city lifestyle.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.880]   Jung retreated to Bollingen, not to escape his professional life, but instead to advance
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   it.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.960]   Carl Jung went on to become one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.360]   There are, of course, many reasons for his eventual success.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.960]   In this book, however, I'm interested in his commitment to the following skill, which
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.720]   almost certainly played a key role in his accomplishments.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.960]   Deep work.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.800]   Professional activities, performed in a state of distraction-free concentration, that push
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.680]   your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:23.240]   These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.760]   Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760]   capacity.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.440]   Listen carefully.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:37.360]   Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.360]   capacity.
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.840]   Remember my metaphor here?
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:47.120]   The discussion between the powerful supercomputer and the internet connection?
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.420]   capacity.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.840]   We now know from decades of research in both psychology and neuroscience that the state
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:05.180]   of mental strain that accompanies deep work is also necessary to improve your abilities.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:10.360]   Deep work, in other words, was exactly the type of effort needed to stand out in a cognitively
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.760]   demanding field like academic psychiatry in the early 20th century.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.040]   The term "deep work" is my own, and is not something Carl Jung would have used, but
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:25.840]   his actions during this period were those of someone who understood the underlying concept.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:30.240]   Jung built a tower out of stone in the woods to promote deep work in his professional life,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.720]   a task that required time, energy, and money.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.020]   It also took him away from more immediate pursuits.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:43.560]   As Mason Currie writes, Jung's regular journeys to Bollingen reduced the time he spent on
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.680]   his clinical work, noting "although he had many patients who relied on him, Jung was
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.400]   not shy about taking time off.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:57.600]   Deep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of changing the world."
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.680]   I interrupt the story to make this application personal.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:11.480]   Deep work in your life, dear friend, though a burden to prioritize, is crucial for your
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:17.520]   goal of changing your world.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:25.080]   Deep work, though a burden to prioritize in the life of your child, is crucial for your
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.960]   goal and perhaps his goal of changing the world.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:35.320]   Indeed, if you study the lives of other influential figures from both distant and recent history,
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.600]   you'll find that a commitment to deep work is a common theme.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.640]   The 16th century essayist Michel de Montaigne, for example, prefigured Jung by working in
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.960]   a private library he built in the Southern Tower guarding the stone walls of his French
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:52.720]   chateau, while Mark Twain wrote much of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in a shed on the
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   property of the Quarry Farm in New York, where he was spending the summer.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.440]   Twain's study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to blowing a horn
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.240]   to attract his attention for meals.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.220]   Moving forward in history, consider the screenwriter and director Woody Allen.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:16.140]   In the 44-year period between 1969 and 2013, Woody Allen wrote and directed 44 films that
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:22.700]   received 23 Academy Award nominations, an absurd rate of artistic productivity.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:28.500]   Throughout this period, Allen never owned a computer, instead completing all his writing,
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:34.860]   free from electronic distraction, on a German Olympia SM3 manual typewriter.
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.020]   Allen is joined in his rejection of computers by Peter Higgs, a theoretical physicist who
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.420]   performs his work in such disconnected isolation that journalists couldn't find him after
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.780]   it was announced he had won the Nobel Prize.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:52.100]   J.K. Rowling, on the other hand, does use a computer, but was famously absent from social
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.660]   media during the writing of her Harry Potter novels, even though this period coincided
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:01.340]   with the rise of the technology and its popularity among media figures.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:06.100]   Rowling's staff finally started a Twitter account in her name in the fall of 2009, as
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.980]   she was working on The Casual Vacancy, and for the first year and a half her only tweet
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:14.940]   read "This is the real me but you won't be hearing from me often I am afraid as pen
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:18.460]   and paper is my priority at the moment."
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.180]   Deep work of course is not limited to the historical or technophobic.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:27.060]   Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted "think weeks" twice a year, during which
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   he would isolate himself, often in a lakeside cottage, to do nothing but read and think
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.420]   big thoughts.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:38.500]   It was during a 1995 "think week" that Gates wrote his famous "Internet Tidal Wave"
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:44.460]   memo that turned Microsoft's attention to an upstart company called Netscape Communications.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:49.700]   And in an ironic twist, Neil Stephenson, the acclaimed cyberpunk author who helped form
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.880]   our popular conception of the Internet age, is near impossible to reach electronically.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.060]   His website offers no email address and features an essay about why he is purposefully bad
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.940]   at using social media.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.540]   Here is how he once explained the omission "If I organize my life in such a way that
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:10.600]   I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time chunks, I can write novels.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.000]   If I instead get interrupted a lot, what replaces it?
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.580]   Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time, there is a bunch of email messages
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.660]   that I have sent out to individual persons."
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:28.560]   The ubiquity of deep work among influential individuals is important to emphasize because
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.440]   it stands in sharp contrast to the behavior of most modern knowledge workers, a group
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.700]   that is rapidly forgetting the value of going deep.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:41.900]   The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.140]   Network tools.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:48.320]   This is a broad category that captures communication services like email and SMS, social media
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.560]   networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tanglement of infotainment sites like
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.420]   Buzzfeed and Reddit.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:59.300]   In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:06.100]   and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers' attention into slivers.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   A 2012 McKinsey study found that the average knowledge worker now spends more than 60%
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:17.060]   of the work week engaged in electronic communication and Internet searching, with close to 30%
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.860]   of a worker's time dedicated to reading and answering email alone.
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.460]   This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.040]   periods of uninterrupted thinking.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.620]   At the same time, however, modern knowledge workers are not loafing.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.420]   In fact, they report that they are as busy as ever.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.500]   What explains the discrepancy?
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.940]   A lot can be explained by another type of effort which provides a counterpart to the
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.780]   idea of deep work.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.060]   Shallow work – non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks often performed while
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.180]   distracted.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:55.400]   These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.100]   In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:05.260]   work with a shallow alternative, constantly sending and receiving email messages like
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:10.340]   human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:14.420]   Major efforts that would be well served by deep thinking, such as forming a new business
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:19.800]   strategy, or writing an important grant application, get fragmented into distracted dashes that
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.140]   produce muted quality.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:25.780]   To make matters worse for depth, there is increasing evidence that this shift toward
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:29.740]   the shallow is not a choice that can be easily reversed.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:35.580]   Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.900]   perform deep work.
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.060]   What the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation,
[01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:47.860]   admitted journalist Nicholas Carr in an off-cited 2008 Atlantic article.
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.780]   And I'm not the only one.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:54.140]   Carr expanded this argument into a book, The Shallows, which became a finalist for the
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.660]   Pulitzer Prize.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:02.380]   To write The Shallows appropriately enough, Carr had to move to a cabin and forcibly disconnect.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:06.300]   The idea that network tools are pushing our work from the deep toward the shallow is not
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.300]   new.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.580]   The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the internet's
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:13.060]   effect on our brains and work habits.
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:16.820]   These subsequent titles include William Powers' Hamlet's Blackberry, John Freeman's The
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.860]   Tyranny of Email, and Alex Soo-Jung Kim-Peng's The Distraction Addiction, all of which agree,
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:27.620]   more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration,
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.140]   while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.260]   Given this existing body of evidence, I will not spend more time in this book trying to
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.020]   establish this point.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.820]   We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.180]   I'll also sidestep any grand arguments about the long-term societal consequence of this
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.220]   shift, as such arguments tend to open impassable rifts.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:54.060]   On one side of the debate are techno-skeptics like Jaron Lanier and John Freeman, who suspect
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.200]   that many of these tools, at least in their current state, damage society, while on the
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.460]   other side techno-optimists like Clive Thompson argue that they're changing society for
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.060]   sure, but in ways that'll make us better off.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.420]   Google, for example, might reduce our memory, but we no longer need good memories, as in
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   the moment we can now search for anything we need to know.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:16.140]   I have no stance in this philosophical debate.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:21.100]   My interest in this matter instead veers toward a thesis of much more pragmatic and individualized
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.460]   interest.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.420]   Our work culture's shift toward the shallow, whether you think it's philosophically good
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:32.620]   or bad, is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:38.540]   the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth, an opportunity that, not
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:45.020]   too long ago, was leveraged by a bored young consultant from Virginia named Jason Benn.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:52.260]   Pay attention in this particular story, because it indicates the opportunities that all of
[01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:53.420]   us have.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:58.100]   If you are looking to increase your income so that you can reach your financial goals,
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.820]   I'm offering you a path to that.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:05.540]   There are many ways to discover that you're not valuable in our economy.
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:09.780]   For Jason Benn, the lesson was made clear when he realized, not long after taking a
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:14.080]   job as a financial consultant, that the vast majority of his work responsibilities could
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.140]   be automated by a "kludged together" Excel script.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:22.420]   The firm that hired Benn produced reports for banks involved in complex deals.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.260]   It was about as interesting as it sounds, Benn joked in one of our interviews.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:30.820]   The report creation process required hours of manual manipulation of data in a series
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.780]   of Excel spreadsheets.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.860]   When he first arrived, it took Benn up to six hours per report to finish this stage.
[01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:42.060]   The most efficient veterans of the firm could complete this task in around half the time.
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.060]   This didn't sit well with Benn.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:48.980]   The way it was taught to me, the process seemed clunky and manually intensive, Benn recalls.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:54.500]   He knew that Excel has a feature called macros that allows users to automate common tasks.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.300]   Benn read articles on the topic and soon put together a new worksheet, wired up with a
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:02.420]   series of these macros that could take the six hour process of manual data manipulation
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.220]   and replace it, essentially, with a button click.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:09.540]   A report writing process that originally took him a full workday could now be reduced to
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.300]   less than an hour.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.860]   Benn is a smart guy.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:17.900]   He graduated from an elite college, the University of Virginia, with a degree in economics, and
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.620]   like many in his situation, he had ambitions for his career.
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:25.660]   It didn't take him long to realize that these ambitions would be thwarted so long as his
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.220]   main professional skills could be captured in an Excel macro.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.100]   He decided, therefore, he needed to increase his value to the world.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:36.840]   After a period of research, Benn reached a conclusion.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:41.760]   He would, he declared to his family, quit his job as a human spreadsheet and become
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.660]   a computer programmer.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.820]   As is often the case with such grand plans, however, there was a hitch.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.820]   Jason Benn had no idea how to write code.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.140]   As a computer scientist, I can confirm an obvious point.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.340]   Programming computers is hard.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.940]   Most new developers dedicate a four-year college education to learning the ropes before their
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.940]   first job, and even then, competition for the best spots is fierce.
[01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:07.420]   Jason Benn didn't have this time.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.860]   After his Excel epiphany, he quit his job at the financial firm and moved home to prepare
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.540]   for his next step.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.940]   His parents were happy he had a plan, but they weren't happy about the idea that this
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.580]   return home might be long-term.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:24.900]   Benn needed to learn a hard skill and needed to do so fast.
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.300]   It's here that Benn ran into the same problem that holds back many knowledge workers from
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.180]   navigating into more explosive career trajectories.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:38.360]   Learning something complex, like computer programming, requires intense, uninterrupted
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:44.060]   concentration on cognitively demanding concepts, the type of concentration that drove Carl
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.880]   Jung to the woods surrounding Lake Zurich.
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.240]   His task, in other words, is an act of deep work.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.160]   Most knowledge workers, however, as I argued earlier in this introduction, have lost their
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.440]   ability to perform deep work.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.080]   Benn was no exception to this trend.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.520]   "I was always getting on the internet and checking my email.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.520]   I couldn't stop myself.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.920]   It was a compulsion," Benn said, describing himself during the period leading up to his
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.840]   quitting his finance job.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:15.400]   To emphasize his difficulty with depth, Benn told me about a project that a supervisor
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.680]   at the finance firm once brought to him.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:20.960]   "They wanted me to write a business plan," he explained.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.600]   Benn didn't know how to write a business plan, so he decided he would find and read
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.880]   five different existing plans, comparing and contrasting them to understand what was needed.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.280]   This was a good idea, but Benn had a problem.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.580]   "I couldn't stay focused."
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.480]   There were days during this period, he now admits, when he spent almost every minute
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.880]   (98% of my time) surfing the web.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.680]   The business plan project, a chance to distinguish himself early in his career, fell to the wayside.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.160]   By the time he quit, Benn was well aware of his difficulties with deep work.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.380]   So when he dedicated himself to learning how to code, he knew he had to simultaneously
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:59.240]   teach his mind how to go deep.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.040]   His method was drastic, but effective.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.960]   "I locked myself in a room with no computer, just textbooks, note cards, and a highlighter."
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.040]   He would highlight the computer programming textbooks, transfer the ideas to note cards,
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.160]   and then practice them out loud.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.080]   These periods free from electronic distraction were hard at first, but Benn gave himself
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.960]   no other option.
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.160]   He had to learn this material, and he made sure there was nothing in that room to distract
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160]   him.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.320]   Over time, however, he got better at concentrating, eventually getting to a point where he was
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:36.080]   regularly clocking five or more disconnected hours per day in the room, focused without
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.200]   distraction on learning this hard new skill.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.320]   "I probably read something like 18 books on the topic by the time I was done," he
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.640]   recalls.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.440]   After two months locked away studying, Benn attended the notoriously difficult Dev Boot
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:55.480]   Camp, a 100-hour-a-week crash course in web application programming.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:00.080]   While researching the program, Benn found a student with a PhD from Princeton who described
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.900]   Dev as "the hardest thing I've ever done in my life."
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:09.120]   Given both his preparation and his newly honed ability for deep work, Benn excelled.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.760]   "Some people show up not prepared," he said.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.800]   "They can't focus.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.680]   They can't learn quickly."
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:19.440]   Only half the students who started the program with Benn ended up graduating on time.
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.760]   Benn not only graduated, but was also the top student in his class.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.240]   The deep work paid off.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.160]   Benn quickly landed a job as a developer at a San Francisco tech startup with $25 million
[01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.200]   in venture funding and its pick of employees.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.720]   When Benn quit his job as a financial consultant, only half a year earlier, he was making $40,000
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:40.720]   a year.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.520]   His new job as a computer developer paid $100,000, an amount that can continue to grow, essentially
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.700]   without limit, in the Silicon Valley market, along with his skill level.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.720]   When I last spoke with Benn, he was thriving in his new position.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:59.960]   A newfound devotee of deep work, he rented an apartment across the street from his office,
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.160]   allowing him to show up early in the morning before anyone else arrived and work without
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.160]   distraction.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.000]   "On good days, I can get in four hours of focus before the first meeting," he told
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   me.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   "Then maybe another three to four hours in the afternoon.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.160]   And I do mean focus.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.880]   No email, no hacker news, just programming."
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.260]   For someone who admitted to sometimes spending up to 98% of his day in his old job surfing
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:29.920]   the web, Jason Benn's transformation is nothing short of astonishing.
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:35.160]   Friend, if you're struggling with this, you can change.
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.220]   I can change.
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.520]   Your children can change.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.500]   Harder to change your children, because then you have to deal with their motivation and
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.520]   how do you motivate another person?
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.520]   Difficult.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.080]   But you can start by setting an example, and I can start by setting an example.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.200]   Change is hard, but it's worth it.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.240]   Jason Benn's story highlights a crucial lesson.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:05.320]   Deep work is not some nostalgic affectation of writers and early 20th century philosophers.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.860]   It's instead a skill that has great value today.
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.840]   There are two reasons for this value.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.240]   The first has to do with learning.
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:19.720]   We have an information economy that's dependent on complex systems that change rapidly.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.560]   Some of the computer languages Benn learned, for example, didn't exist 10 years ago and
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.320]   will likely be outdated 10 years from now.
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.160]   Similarly, someone coming up in the field of marketing in the 1990s probably had no
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.920]   idea that today they'd need to master digital analytics.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:38.560]   To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.520]   complicated things.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.580]   This task requires deep work.
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:48.320]   If you don't cultivate this ability, you're likely to fall behind as technology advances.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.160]   The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.600]   revolution cut both ways.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.840]   If you can create something useful, its reachable audience, e.g. employers or customers, is
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:06.440]   essentially limitless, which greatly magnifies your reward.
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:10.760]   On the other hand, if what you're producing is mediocre, then you're in trouble, as it's
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.080]   too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:20.240]   Whether you're a computer programmer, writer, marketer, consultant, or entrepreneur, your
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:25.720]   situation has become similar to Jung trying to outwit Freud, or Jason Benn trying to hold
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.040]   his own in a hot startup.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.920]   To succeed, you have to produce the absolute best stuff you're capable of producing, a
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.480]   task that requires depth.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.600]   The growing necessity of deep work is new.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.600]   In an industrial economy, there was a small, skilled, labor, and professional class for
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.340]   which deep work was crucial, but most workers could do just fine without ever cultivating
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.340]   an ability to concentrate without distraction.
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:57.080]   They were paid to crank widgets, and not much about their job would change in the decades
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.440]   they kept it.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.720]   But as we shift to an information economy, more and more of our population are knowledge
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:10.200]   workers, and deep work is becoming a key currency, even if most haven't yet recognized this
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.960]   reality.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:17.000]   Deep work is not, in other words, an old-fashioned skill falling into irrelevance.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.480]   It's instead a crucial ability for anyone looking to move ahead in a globally competitive
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.600]   information economy that tends to chew up and spit out those who aren't earning their
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.680]   keep.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.160]   The real rewards are reserved not for those who are comfortable using Facebook, a shallow
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.240]   task, easily replicated, but instead for those who are comfortable building the innovative,
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:45.600]   integrated systems that run the service, a decidedly deep task, hard to replicate.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:51.680]   Deep work is so important that we might consider it, to use the phrasing of business writer
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.720]   Eric Barker, "the superpower of the 21st century."
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.960]   We have now seen two strands of thought, one about the increasing scarcity of deep work,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:08.340]   and the other about its increasing value, which we can combine into the idea that provides
[01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:12.640]   the foundation for everything that follows in this book.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.560]   The Deep Work Hypothesis The ability to perform deep work is becoming
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.040]   increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.440]   economy.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.760]   As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill and then make it the core of their working
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.480]   life will thrive.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.040]   This book has two goals pursued in two parts.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.720]   The first, tackled in part one, is to convince you the deep work hypothesis is true.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.600]   The second, tackled in part two, is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:50.480]   by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.640]   of your professional life.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.080]   Before diving into these details, however, I'll take a moment to explain how I became
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.440]   such a devotee of depth.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.400]   I've spent the past decade cultivating my own ability to concentrate on hard things.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.860]   To understand the origins of this interest, it helps to know that I'm a theoretical
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:14.760]   computer scientist who performed my doctoral training in MIT's famed Theory of Computation
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:19.840]   group, a professional setting where the ability to focus is considered a crucial occupational
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   skill.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:26.480]   During these years, I shared a graduate student office down the hall from a MacArthur Genius
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:32.160]   Grant winner, a professor who was hired at MIT before he was old enough to legally drink.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.920]   It wasn't uncommon to find this theoretician sitting in the common space, staring at markings
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:42.680]   on a whiteboard with a group of visiting scholars arrayed around him, also sitting quietly and
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.680]   staring.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.920]   This could go on for hours.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.240]   I'd go to lunch.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.960]   I'd come back.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.320]   Still staring.
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.520]   This particular professor is hard to reach.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.880]   He's not on Twitter, and if he doesn't know you, he's unlikely to respond to your email.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.240]   Last year, he published 16 papers.
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.920]   This type of fierce concentration permeated the atmosphere during my student years.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.360]   Not surprisingly, I soon developed a similar commitment to depth.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.800]   To the chagrin of both my friends and the various publicists I've worked with on my
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.840]   books, I've never had a Facebook or Twitter account or any other social media presence
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.480]   outside of a blog.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.720]   I don't web surf and get most of my news from my home-delivered Washington Post and NPR.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.160]   I'm also generally hard to reach.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.320]   My author website doesn't provide a personal email address, and I didn't own my first smartphone
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.440]   until 2012, when my pregnant wife gave me an ultimatum.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.560]   You have to have a phone that works before our son is born.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:39.980]   On the other hand, my commitment to depth has rewarded me.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:44.280]   In the 10-year period following my college graduation, I published four books, earned
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:49.220]   a PhD, wrote peer-reviewed academic papers at a high rate, and was hired as a 10-year
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.760]   track professor at Georgetown University.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:57.600]   I maintained this voluminous production while rarely working past 5 or 6 p.m. during the
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.160]   work week.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:04.360]   This compressed schedule is possible because I've invested significant effort to minimize
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.920]   the shallow in my life, while making sure I get the most out of the time this frees
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:09.920]   up.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:15.500]   I build my days around a core of carefully chosen, deep work, with the shallow activities
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:21.160]   I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:27.360]   Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.360]   it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:36.320]   My commitment to depth has also returned non-professional benefits.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.800]   For the most part, I don't touch a computer between the time when I get home from work
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   and the next morning when the new work day begins, the main exception being blog posts,
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.480]   which I like to write after my kids go to bed.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:51.580]   This ability to fully disconnect, as opposed to the more standard practice of sneaking
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:57.240]   in a few quick work email checks or giving in to frequent surveys of social media sites,
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.200]   allows me to be present with my wife and two sons in the evenings, and read a surprising
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.120]   number of books for a busy father of two.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:10.160]   More generally, the lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:15.080]   nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people's daily lives.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:20.620]   I'm comfortable being bored, and this can be a surprisingly rewarding skill, especially
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:26.160]   on a lazy DC summer night listening to a Nationals game slowly unfold on the radio.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.880]   This book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:36.280]   depth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that have helped me act
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:37.280]   on this attraction.
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.040]   I have committed this thinking to words, in part to help you follow my lead in rebuilding
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:46.360]   your life around deep work, but this isn't the whole story.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.640]   My other interest in distilling and clarifying these thoughts is to further develop my own
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640]   practice.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:56.200]   Your recognition of the deep work hypothesis has helped me thrive, but I'm convinced
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.360]   that I haven't yet reached my full value-producing potential.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:05.080]   As you struggle, and ultimately triumph with the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead,
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.540]   you can be assured that I'm following suit, ruthlessly culling the shallow and painstakingly
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.920]   cultivating the intensity of my depth.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.120]   You'll learn how I fare in this book's conclusion.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.960]   When Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in
[01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.960]   the woods.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:27.800]   Jung's Bollingen Tower became a place where he could maintain his ability to think deeply,
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.360]   and then apply the skill to produce work of such stunning originality that it changed
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:32.760]   the world.
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.040]   In the pages ahead, I'll try to convince you to join me in the effort to build our
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:41.880]   own personal Bollingen Towers, to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:47.240]   distracted world, and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:50.360]   personalities of generations past.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.700]   A deep life is a good life.
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:59.480]   And thus concludes the introduction to Cal Newport's book entitled "Deep Work."
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.120]   Strongly recommended.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:07.320]   Friends, the world of the future is going to be much less egalitarian than the world
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.840]   of today.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:17.680]   Instead of a fairly homogenous society with a big middle class and everybody earning about
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.880]   the same amount of money, it's not going to be that way.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.480]   The world of the future is going to be a world of extremes.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.560]   This continues the trend.
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:35.640]   The most productive 20% of workers are going to receive 80% of the compensation.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:46.240]   The most productive of that 20%, meaning the top 4%, are going to receive 80% of the 80%,
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:50.000]   which means the top 64% of rewards.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.480]   Your career focus should be to always be in the top 4% of your field.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:04.680]   And in so doing, you will be part of the very small cadre of workers earning 64% of the
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.060]   total income available.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:16.200]   In the fullness of time, you will be in the top 4% of wealthy people who control 64% of
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.640]   the wealth.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:23.400]   If possible, it would be great if you could move into the top 20% of the top 4%, which
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.640]   would be the top .8%, let's call it 1% among friends.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:39.440]   And in so doing, you will be part of the top 1% that controls 80% of the top 80% of wealth.
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.240]   Hopefully I did that right.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:47.640]   That means that you will be part of the top 1% that controls 51.2% of the wealth of your
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.560]   nation, of your world, etc.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.040]   You will have a huge set of problems when that happens.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:00.680]   There will be hordes of people with pitchforks, both physical and digital, desiring to take
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.080]   that wealth away.
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:07.720]   You will also have a huge set of problems to say, "How am I responsible with this wealth?"
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:14.840]   But the way that you get there is by using the intelligence that you have and harnessing
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:21.360]   your attention span so that you can take actions and produce work that matters.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:27.280]   The reason I read you that entire introduction is to show you, here's a story from someone
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.920]   else of how that can be gained.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.600]   You can start with nothing.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:33.980]   You can put yourself in a room.
[01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:37.160]   You can force yourself to learn something and go into a new field.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:44.640]   And if you continue to work in that field, you'll continue to enjoy the benefits of it.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.920]   Deep work is indeed the superpower of the 21st century.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.200]   Now one of the things I've noticed over the years is how absurdly easy it is in the modern
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.720]   world to be in the top 20% of society.
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.760]   Years ago I did a show on the 1000% formula.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:09.400]   I pointed out how if you're practicing the 1000% formula, you read a book a week, basically
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.040]   because you read 30 to 60 minutes a day.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.040]   You read about a book a week.
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.040]   You read a book a week.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.360]   That's about 50 books per year.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.720]   I pointed out how books are the most efficient form of knowledge acquisition because you're
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.280]   standing on the shoulders of giants who are standing on the shoulders of giants who are
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.920]   standing on the shoulders of giants of people who have distilled their ideas into the most
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.520]   fundamental concepts possibly available.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.520]   Pointed all that out.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:31.520]   And I showed you.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:33.800]   I said, "Remember, you're living in a society where nobody reads.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:39.200]   Now over the next 10 years, you will have read 500 books in your field.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.120]   You're going to be at the top of your field no matter what because nobody reads for the
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.680]   price of what?
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:53.880]   Call it 15 bucks a book times 500 books, $7,500 over the next 10 years of investment
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:59.160]   in yourself, you're practically in the top, again, you're guaranteed to be in the top
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.800]   20% if not the top 20% of the top 20%.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:11.200]   But today in 2023, the situation is even more lopsided.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.440]   When I used to talk about the 1000% formula almost 10 years ago, I talked about it in
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.480]   the context of reading.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.760]   Well, today, even if somebody reads, nobody has the attention span to actually follow
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.640]   through on anything.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.480]   And so your ability to follow through and just do something, because remember, it's
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.080]   action that leads to outcomes, not knowledge, it's action.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:38.360]   If you can cultivate an attention span and do deep work, just even more, the distinction
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.880]   is going to be even bigger.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:45.360]   All your friends are going to be glued to their phones, swipe, swipe, swipe on whatever
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:50.600]   their app of choice is, rotting their brains, decreasing their gray matter, lowering their
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.000]   willpower, basically destroying their brains.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.120]   Decision is yours.
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:01.080]   Same thing with your children, you have a choice.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:07.080]   Do you allow your children to be stupefied by the culture around?
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:13.040]   Or do you step in and teach your children how to do deep work?
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.480]   I've done my best and I will continue to do my best to share with you whatever strategies
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.600]   I can see that come up with, but you have to just use that paradigm and figure out what's
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:24.000]   going to work in your family for yourself, for your children.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.920]   Maybe it's those apps that I said, take a look at your screen time, take a look at the
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.120]   OneSec app.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.120]   Maybe it's dumping your phone.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.600]   There's all kinds of things that you could do.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.440]   You got to figure out what's going to work for you.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.160]   The chain starts with the desire to change and then you figure out how to change.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.200]   But this is the superpower of the 21st century.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.120]   Knowledge is the starting point.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.520]   I guess desire, ambition, goals are the starting point.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.240]   Then you acquire knowledge, just the knowledge that you need to start your process towards
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.640]   those goals.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:00.920]   And then from there, you need attention span to do deep work, to take the actions that
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.240]   are going to move you toward your goals.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.360]   But if you'll do that, the future for you and for your family and for your children
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   is unlimited.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.200]   We're living in the greatest time to be alive in human history.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.800]   What it takes though, is someone to open their eyes, look around and recognize how do you
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.040]   thrive in this modern world?
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.560]   And I've given you the formula as best I understand it.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:55.520]   I hope that you'll take it and you'll implement it.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.520]   [music]
