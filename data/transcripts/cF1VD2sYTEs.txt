[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.540]   And Pastor John, we have not done an entire episode on the midlife crisis, especially
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.080]   your own experience of a midlife crisis.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.440]   But you have a story to tell, though it's not something that you have talked about at
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   length.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.200]   I think there's an old conversation with you and John MacArthur where you talked about
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.360]   it a little bit more length.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.880]   Now speak to middle-aged listeners, men who are 40 or who are nearly 40.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.520]   What did you learn during that dark season of your own life?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.200]   And what would you say to other men who are facing those midlife years or soon to be in
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   them?
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400]   Take us into your story and what you learned from it.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:53.880]   I think I was 40 when we were on vacation in California and Ben Patterson, who was at
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.760]   that time the pastor of a Presbyterian church in Irvine, asked me to preach for him and
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   offered me his house for some days of vacation while they were away.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.600]   And so we took him up on it.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.840]   And two things happened, which were remarkable and probably a wake-up call, a warning for
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.560]   me in midlife to hold fast to Jesus.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.840]   One was that I felt inexplicably depressed while I was there.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.720]   One morning I was sitting on the stairway to the second level of their house crying.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.120]   And my wife found me and was startled because that's not typical.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.800]   She asked me, "What's wrong?"
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   And I simply said, "I don't have any idea."
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.040]   That's what MacArthur got so surprised by in that conversation that we had.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.320]   He just shook his head and said, "I've never experienced anything like that."
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.640]   I said, "Well, I wish I hadn't."
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.200]   The other thing was that after I preached at Ben's church, it just so happened that
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.600]   Jim Conway, the author of "Men in Midlife Crisis," which I believe is still in print
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   and useful, came to me and asked me how old I was.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   He came up after the service.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   He said, "How old are you?"
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   I thought, "What is that?"
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.680]   And he had introduced himself, so I suspected it must have something to do with midlife.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   He said, "How old are you?"
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.440]   I said, "Forty."
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   He smiled and he said, "You got a year and a half."
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And he meant the average age—I think I've got my details right—the average age for
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.200]   men to pass through midlife crisis is 41 and a half.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.000]   At least that's the way I remember it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.800]   I had never even thought about the issue of midlife crisis.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.480]   I tend not to put a lot of stock in generalizations like that, but there is a good bit of evidence,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:12.080]   isn't there, that something happens for many men as they move into their 40s, and
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.920]   not all of it is pretty.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   I don't remember his exact words, but he summed it up something like this, "Well,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.000]   John, don't leave your wife, don't leave the ministry, don't buy a motorcycle, and
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   don't get a sailboat, don't throw away everything you've built," which kind of
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.680]   captured some of the stupidity that men at this moment do.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   They just throw away some of the most valuable things in their lives and try to make something
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.080]   new out of silliness like that.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.560]   So that gives you a snapshot of my brief experience with it and with him.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.880]   And now I've tried to think, "Why is this?
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.800]   Why does this happen to us?"
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   I am certainly no expert, and people ought to read books, not just listen to a podcast
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.480]   if they want to try to figure this out.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.000]   So let me tell you what I think, though, trying to analyze myself, look at the world, and
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.680]   maybe wave some warning flags for some guys, like you, maybe.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.200]   It's about where you are.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   I suspect that there are physical dimensions to this, like hormonal things, you know, male
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.840]   menopause, whatever you want to call it.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.480]   I'm not an expert, but I would guess that there are changes happening.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.600]   But I don't know enough to talk about that, so I'll leave that to the side.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.200]   I suspect that there are more situational reasons for this.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   For example, a man may feel like he's peaking out in his career, and that it hasn't turned
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.040]   out to be as great as he had hoped.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:12.840]   And a certain measure of disillusionment is settling in as he ponders another 25 years
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.320]   of doing the same thing.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.440]   The dreams for what his vocation might become have not proved to be as satisfying as he
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.400]   thought, and it can be really oppressive to think of doing the same old, same old for
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   another half a lifetime.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.840]   So I think that's part of it.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.560]   Here's another part of it.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.320]   He may look at his body in the mirror, or his wife's body, and realize it's downhill
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.680]   from here on.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   I mean, we're not getting any prettier or handsomer.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.880]   He's not going to look any more handsome, any more fit, and she's not either.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.360]   In fact, he may have let himself go and become a kind of overweight, bedraggled, average,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.760]   run-of-the-mill, paunchy man, and feel lousy about it, but physically too tired to do anything
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.040]   about it.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.400]   And the pressures of his vocational life have caused him to let go his exercise, let go
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.280]   any routine of fitness, and maybe even he's not getting enough sleep because kids and
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.040]   work and stress is who knows what all.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.520]   And when you don't get enough sleep, you get discouraged and easily depressed.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.200]   So a bunch of cluster of things like that.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:41.160]   And very possibly, he and his wife have settled into a kind of 20-year-old coexistence with
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.740]   their long-discovered differences that have not been worked out very well and still function
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.560]   like irritants between them.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.160]   And the peace and the pleasure that he used to enjoy and hoped would get better have been
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.600]   replaced with a kind of truce with neither he nor her offering affirmation and joyful
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.840]   partnership like they used to, and that dream seems to be drying up from what he had hoped
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.480]   it would be.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.000]   And here's one more, and I have the gut feeling that this may be close to the heart of the
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.640]   matter for some guys.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.620]   I don't know whether it was for me or not, but this feels big.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.200]   At this point in his life, his children—and of course, I'm just thinking of guys that
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:40.480]   get children—his children are probably entering their teen years, and they're forcing on
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   him questions of his own moral and spiritual identity as he tries to lead his children
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.960]   into adulthood, and the uncertainties and the questions and the perplexities of raising
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   kids, raising young adults in this world feels like never-ending pressure and confusion for
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.280]   which there are just no simple answers.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:15.240]   And the need to give guidance and provision and example to the children is relentless
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.660]   and never-ending.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.440]   There are no days off from parenting.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.720]   And this all feels new because raising teenagers is so different from raising three-year-olds
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.080]   and nine-year-olds.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:38.720]   So for all those reasons, Tony, and more, I suspect there is something very real to
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.160]   this issue of men in midlife crisis.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:52.120]   And looking back now from age 71, I am overflowing with thankfulness to the mercy and the power
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.200]   of God to hold onto me during those years.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.280]   There are some pretty depressing parts of John Piper's journal.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.560]   I hope the world doesn't ever get to look at them, because they just—I mean, when
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.880]   I look at them, I have to say, "Thank you, Father, if you had not been massively true
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   to your promises to complete the good work that you began, I sure didn't have the fingers
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.040]   to grip this cliff."
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:28.160]   So my encouragement to men is that you lay hold of Jesus Christ, as Paul says in Philippians
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.880]   3:12, "Precisely because he has laid hold of you."
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.800]   That you get up in the morning before your children—and I know that's a challenge,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.960]   they've got to be at school at 730, good night, but I did it for years, and I know
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.000]   it's crucial—get up before your children, go to your private place, get down on your
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.360]   knees before God Almighty and beg Him for strength for another day.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.680]   And that He would fulfill His promise never to leave you, never to forsake you, that He
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.120]   would help you and strengthen you and uphold you by His Word.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.000]   And tell Him, tell Him every morning that He is your only hope as you instruct these
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   children in His Word.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.200]   And ask your wife if you can get a half day away on a Saturday or a Sunday, and you go
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.080]   away for three or four hours, borrow somebody's house if it's wintertime, go to the park
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:30.520]   if it's not, take a Bible and a notepad, and you wrestle with God for three hours until
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.760]   you get fresh clarity for why you are on planet Earth.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.560]   What is the purpose of your life?
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.000]   Get clarity.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.800]   And I don't mean mainly which other vocation should I have besides the one I'm in.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.120]   I mean, that might be part of it, but that's not the issue.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.640]   The issue is, what about the radical commitments of Acts 20, verse 24?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.440]   What about the radical commitment of Philippians 1:20?
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   And Paul gets real clarity, and it's not complex, it's short.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.560]   You can put it in a sentence for why he exists.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:15.760]   To magnify Jesus Christ, whether strong or weak, whether living or dying, to finish our
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   course in faith and love, not turning to the right, not turning to the left, not making
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.960]   shipwreck of our faith or our marriage or our ministry.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.660]   And I have no doubt, brothers, I have no doubt that if you will take the time to seek his
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:39.520]   face and know him and love him, you will mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.800]   You will run and not be weary.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.480]   You will walk and not faint.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   It's true.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.920]   I know it's true.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:54.200]   I have tasted it in the impossible moments when you don't think you could do another
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.640]   thing you lay hold on Isaiah 40.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:06.640]   I promise you that if you stay faithful to your wife, God will re-enchant your marriage
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.160]   in ways you can't imagine.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.000]   And the children, they're in his hands.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.320]   You are not God.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.360]   You are his emissary.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   Tell them.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.920]   Tell them the truth every day from Scripture.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.240]   Live it with love and meekness and lowliness and penitence and strength as best you can
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.720]   and put them in the hands of God.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.960]   God is faithful.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   That's the bottom line.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.080]   >>So good and helpful, Pastor John.
