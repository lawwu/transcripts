[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - We are back one last time with author
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.160]   and pastor Ray Orland.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.960]   Ray, when you think about your church in Nashville,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.720]   what is the vision you send them out with into the world?
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.800]   What's your vision of a local church
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.840]   sent out into a world that's hostile to Christ?
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880]   What do you seek to instill in your church as they go?
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.200]   - I don't try to instill in them
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   an angry determination to go and defeat our city
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.960]   and defeat our nation and the political purposes of others.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.640]   I just don't see that as God's calling upon us.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.040]   But instead, Jeremiah 29, seven says,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.400]   seek the peace of the city where I have sent you into exile.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.920]   And that city was Babylon.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.560]   It was not a nice place.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.280]   It was infested with idols.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.880]   But God is saying in that verse,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   I want you to live there.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.520]   I want you to settle down there.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.920]   Don't try to run away.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.800]   I don't want you to be escapist
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.760]   and bring my peace into that city.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.080]   I am going, I'm gonna give you an address
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.880]   in the suburbs of hell.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.600]   And I want you to create beauty for my glory
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.840]   and for their benefit in that hard place.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.160]   So for us, Tony, for Jannie and me,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.560]   one thing it means is we have the privilege
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.240]   of having in our home someone as a long-term guest
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.520]   in our home, someone who has been very seriously mistreated
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.360]   and is beginning to put her life back together again.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.320]   This person does not know the Lord.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.080]   This person has suffered.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.240]   And I cannot tell you how joyful it is to us,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.280]   how we feel we're the ones receiving the gift
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.800]   as we want to bring into an environment of peace,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.840]   someone who really needs another chance at life.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.440]   So I am, you know, in his wonderful book,
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   "The Church at the End of the 20th Century,"
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.480]   Francis Schaeffer has a chapter in there
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   entitled "Revolutionary Christianity,"
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.040]   in which he talks about throwing our homes open.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.240]   He painted the picture in his own home there in Switzerland,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   how as they opened their home with radical community,
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.000]   all their wedding gifts were broken and torn and so forth.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.640]   People burned holes in the carpet with their cigarettes.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.360]   People threw up on the carpet.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.760]   Well, that is actually a privilege.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.200]   It's a privilege to give people a place in our reality
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.600]   for Jesus' sake and to show them a love
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.400]   they don't even believe exists.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   And if they can't see it, how can they believe it?
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.640]   - Yes, amen.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160]   Ray, thank you for your time
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.520]   and answering questions with us.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   - Thank you, Tony.

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080]   as John Piper is on an extended writing leave
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.120]   working on his next major book project,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   which I hope to share more about later with you.
