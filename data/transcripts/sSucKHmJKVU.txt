[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.700]   A podcast listener named Apollo writes in to ask this. This is a follow-up to
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.160]   episode number 345 in which you asked, "Are you killing sin by the Spirit?" Pastor
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.520]   John, what does this mean? How do I kill sin by the Spirit? All my thinking and
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   praying and practicing on this point of killing sin begins with Romans 8 13. If
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.240]   death the deeds of the body, there it is, by the Spirit kill, put to death the
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.040]   deeds of the body you will live. So there it is from the very mouth of God. Put to
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.680]   death, kill, slay, murder the deeds of the body, meaning the sinful ones. And of
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.440]   course it doesn't mean just make sure your body doesn't do bad things and
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.200]   doesn't matter what your heart does. Of course that's not what Paul means. He
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.320]   knows that bodily deeds that are wrong are rooted in hearts that are wrong, and
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   so the killing has to begin at the root and not just--or at least it has to
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.040]   go to the root, not just to the fruit in the body. So kill the deeds of
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.600]   the body means kill the root of temptation, the root of sin in your heart.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.160]   The old word for put to death was "mortify," but it's become so weak in our
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.000]   day because lots of people think it means just be embarrassed, like, "Oh, I was just so
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280]   mortified." Well, that's not what John Owen meant when he wrote The Mortification
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.640]   of Sin, which is a book I would highly recommend. I just got it out again this
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   morning. 85 pages in the collected works, 350 years ago, probably the best thing
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.360]   that's been written on Romans 8:13. 85 pages all in one verse, and it's got that
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.080]   famous line in it, "Be killing sin or sin will be killing you." So mortification of
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.000]   sin meant kill it, slay it, put it to death. So here's my answer to
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.280]   the how question, and I take it straight out of the verse. There is one clue for
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   the how in verse 13 of Romans 8. It says, "If by the Spirit you put to death the
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.360]   deeds of the body." So how do you do it? You do it by the Spirit. You act in such
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.760]   a way that the Spirit is acting. You kill in such a way that it is the Spirit
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.120]   killing. Now what is that? And that's not a marginal question, like
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.480]   this is, oh, out here on the periphery and central things in the Christian life or
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.560]   something else. This is as central as it gets in living the Christian life, because
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.440]   for Paul, this was the Christian life. You could call it walking by the Spirit, or
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.520]   bearing the fruit of the Spirit, or being led by the Spirit. He uses all those
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.720]   terms to talk about how do you act towards holiness and sinfulness in such
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   a way that the Spirit Himself is acting in and through you. So here's
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.440]   my answer in two or three steps of how do you do this. Step number one, Ephesians
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.280]   617 says that the weapon that the Spirit uses to kill sin is the Word of God. It
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   says, "Take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." The one piece
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.840]   of armor in Ephesians 6 that is used for killing is the sword, and it happens to be
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   the sword of the Spirit, and that happens to be the Word of God. I don't think
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.520]   that's any accident that when Romans 8 13 says, "Put to death the deeds of
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.080]   spirity," put to death the deeds of the body by the Spirit, the Spirit has a
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.040]   sword, and it's used for killing, and it's the Word of God. So my first clue is
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.840]   killing by the Spirit means by the Word. Well, next question. What does
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.400]   that mean? I mean, what do you do with the Word in order for the Spirit to be active
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.160]   like that in killing sin? And there the clue is Galatians 3 5. "Does he who
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.480]   supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.160]   law or by hearing with faith?" So the answer is, by hearing with faith, the
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.600]   Spirit works miracles among you. By hearing with faith, the Spirit is
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:30.040]   supplied to you in your sin-killing work. So how do you put yourself in a position
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.600]   that the Spirit, wielding his sword of the Word, will kill sin in your life? You
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.360]   do it by hearing that Word and trusting what you hear. Now, very practically, what
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   word should we trust? And here I think it's absolutely crucial to say more than
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.260]   "trust the gospel." That's common today, real common. I think it's crucial to say
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.240]   more than "trust in your forgiveness" or "trust in your justification." That's
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.100]   essential because everything is based on that, but that's not the way the New
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.400]   Testament talks about this. The reason that we must hear more, hear and trust
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.960]   more, is because the New Testament illustrates sin-killing over and over by
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.200]   telling us more than "you are forgiven" or "you are accepted" or "you are righteous,"
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.960]   because forgiveness and justification are the foundation, and then it says all
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.000]   the promises of God are "yes" in Christ. So because we're forgiven, because we're
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.920]   justified, all the promises of God, hundreds of promises that are concrete
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.900]   and practical and relate to specific situations, are all true for you. So we
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.540]   never leave the gospel, we're standing on the gospel all the time, but we're
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:55.180]   preaching specific promises to ourself in order to destroy specific sins. So
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.620]   let's just end this with one example. Let's take the sin of greed or
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.340]   covetousness, because here's a verse that shows what the paradigm is for
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.060]   how the New Testament says to fight the sin in the power of the Holy Spirit. So
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.220]   here's Hebrews chapter 13, verses 5 and 6. "Keep your life free from the love of
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.340]   money, and be content with what you have." And here comes the dagger with which
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.100]   you're gonna kill the love of money, and you're gonna kill greed in your life.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:38.100]   "For God said, 'I will never leave you or forsake you.'" So we can confidently say,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.100]   "The Lord is my helper. I will not fear. What can man do to me?" So how do we put
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.740]   to death the sin of greed when the love of money starts to raise its ugly
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.420]   head, and all the fear and the pride that goes with it comes? We hear a word.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.820]   Well, what word do we hear? We hear the word, "I will never leave you. I will never
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.260]   forsake you. I'll be your sufficient helper. Man cannot destroy you. He cannot
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.620]   ruin you. I am for you." You hear those words about this afternoon. I'm talking
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.420]   about this afternoon, or the rent that can't be paid, or the mortgage that's
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.980]   overdue, that specific promise. We hear it, we believe it, and God the Spirit,
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:31.380]   Almighty, with His sword, kills greed and fear and pride in possessions. So, killing
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:39.300]   sin means daily calling to mind and trusting blood-bought specific promises
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:45.060]   of God. Amen, excellent. Thank you, Pastor John. And recommended in this podcast was
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.220]   a book by the Puritan John Owen. The book was titled The Mortification of Sin, but
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.780]   it may actually be easiest to buy this book as a book titled Overcoming Sin and
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.220]   Temptation, which was edited by Kelly Coppock and Justin Taylor for Crossway
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.300]   Books back in 2006. As a bonus, you get two other related books from John Owen on
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.980]   battling sin in the same book. That's Overcoming Sin and Temptation, edited by
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.580]   Kelly Coppock and Justin Taylor. Another episode we recorded on killing sin is
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.380]   episode number 304 in the archive. It's titled Visualizing Christ to Battle Lust.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.540]   Tomorrow is Friday and we will close out the week with a question on 2 Timothy
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.860]   315, specifically, how does Scripture produce faith? I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.300]   We'll see you tomorrow.
