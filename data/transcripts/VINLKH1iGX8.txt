[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   I should like this evening to call your attention to the last three verses in the twelfth chapter
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.720]   of the epistle to the Hebrews, the last three verses that were read to us out of that chapter.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:25.320]   And this word, "yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.160]   as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:41.760]   Wherefore, we, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:52.520]   serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear, for our God is a consuming fire.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   If I may be allowed to say so, I believe that the authorities responsible for the arranging
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.600]   of this Stroud Festival are very right indeed when they realize that the festival should
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.160]   be set in the context of divine or religious worship.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's good that people today should realize that every activity in which we engage as
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.640]   men and women should all be under God.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.960]   One of the great dangers perhaps of this generation to which we belong is that we are prone to
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.720]   isolate various activities and to regard them as existing in and of themselves.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:58.800]   The greatest danger in life at the moment is to forget that everything is under God
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:08.320]   and that every individual activity on our part must be related to the whole of our life
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.720]   and to the condition of the entire world.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.480]   Now that is something that is always true and always important.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.600]   But I believe that we are living in days when this is particularly true.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.440]   Here is something excellent, a festival, a manifestation of the abilities and the gifts
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.000]   that God has given to men.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.920]   But they are exercised, as I say, in the total context of life and of everything that is
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.040]   happening in this world.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.600]   And we are meeting tonight in a world of great crisis and of grave trouble.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.360]   I needn't remind you of that.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.520]   You can't pick up a newspaper or listen to a news bulletin on the television or the wireless
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.600]   without realizing that the world is in very great trouble.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.320]   We are living in a very critical period.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.980]   But it's also true to say that we're living in a time of great testing.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.280]   It's a time when we are all being proved and our ideas with regard to life and what we
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   should do in this world are all under examination.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.440]   It's important therefore that we should face this situation and ask ourselves certain questions.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.960]   Every human being has some kind of philosophy of life, some kind of view of life, even the
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.640]   most thoughtless has got some kind of idea as to why he lives as he does.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.760]   And what I am saying is that our views of life and our ideas of life and living and
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   our activities in life are all under examination at the present time.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.840]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.200]   Take the state of the world tonight.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.040]   We've had two world wars already in this one century, and we all know about these terrible,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.720]   horrible bombs that are still being made, the possibility of a third world war.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.840]   We're aware of all the strife, industrial, social, international.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.220]   We're aware of the breakdown of so many of the noblest institutions that man has ever
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.080]   brought into existence.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.960]   So there are certain questions that we all of us must inevitably face.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.260]   Here's one of them.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.320]   Are you surprised and disappointed at the state of the world as it is at this moment?
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.580]   Does it surprise you?
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.560]   I ask the question for this reason, that there are many people in the world who are very
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.440]   surprised and very disappointed that there should be so much trouble in the world.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.160]   Well, why are they surprised and disappointed?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.880]   For this reason, they were taught and they were ready to accept the teaching that the
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:30.280]   world was gradually improving and evolving annually, century by century, as to a state
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.920]   of perfection.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.640]   This was a very common view, particularly at the end of the last century.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.600]   Popular education had come in in 1870.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   Science was developing in its various branches.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.840]   Knowledge was increasing.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   And on the basis of this, men, politicians, poets, philosophers, and others, all looked
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   forward to the 20th century, which they felt was going to be the golden century, the crowning
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   century.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.920]   Man, at last, had arrived and was in this marvelous position.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.280]   Now, they believed that.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   They believed that political action, education, culture, knowledge, and so on, that all this
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.520]   was going to banish most of our problems.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:31.440]   I mustn't keep you with details, but these men taught that crime, for instance, was rarely
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.440]   due to poverty.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.960]   They said, "You can't expect young people brought up in slums with inadequate housing,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.820]   inadequate food, and clothing, and so on, you can't expect them to live a good life.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.280]   You can't expect anything from them but theft, and robbery, and violence."
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.960]   So they said, "Once we are able to give them better houses, and more money, better education,
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.880]   and so on, we'll get rid of all this."
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.680]   And they really believed that.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.360]   And they believed that you'd banish war in the same way.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.340]   They said that wars were due to the fact that the nations didn't know one another.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.480]   But now the steam engine had arrived, traveling was much easier, and we'd be able to meet
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.760]   people in other countries, and once we met other people, we'd like them, we'd love them,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.480]   and there'd be no more war.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   So Tennyson began to sing about the coming of the Parliament of Men and the federation
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.240]   of the world, how we'd turn our swords into plowshares, and so on.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.320]   Well, that was the idea, that was the theory.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   So that when such people are confronted by the modern world, with all this terrible international
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:57.480]   tension, with wars, and rumors of wars, and mounting moral, social problems, they're amazed.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.200]   They're disappointed, they're unhappy, they didn't expect this.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:09.080]   In other words, the modern conditions are proving that that view of life was entirely
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   wrong.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   It was completely false.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:17.960]   And were it not so serious, it would really be very ludicrous, very laughable.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.400]   Take that explanation of crime, it was said to be due to nothing but poverty.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.440]   Well now, we know that the crime wave is mounting rapidly.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's one of the major problems in society.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.520]   What are such people saying now?
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.840]   What is their explanation of the mounting crime wave?
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.800]   It's actually this, they say the crime wave is due to affluence.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.840]   They say these young people have got so much money in their pockets, the money is burning
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.360]   in their pockets, they don't know what to do with it.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.320]   So now we are told that crime is due to too much money, the exact opposite of what such
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.120]   people were saying a hundred years ago.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.840]   So I'm asking the question, are you surprised at the state of the world tonight?
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.040]   Are you disappointed at it?
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.360]   If so, it means your view of life must have been entirely wrong.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.880]   Well, let me ask another question.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.720]   Can you explain why the world is as it is tonight?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.800]   In spite of all our new educational facilities, we've multiplied schools, primary, secondary,
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.440]   we've multiplied our universities and colleges, we've got further education.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.280]   Never has there been so much education.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.480]   Never have men earned more money.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.680]   Never have there been better housing conditions.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.120]   Everything that can be done has been done.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.560]   Well, why are things as they are?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.240]   What's the matter?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.200]   What's gone wrong?
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.640]   Can you explain the present state of the world?
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.600]   I say again that if you can't explain it, and are simply baffled by it, and throw up
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:06.000]   your hands in despair, it means that your view of life is obviously totally inadequate.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.560]   And there's one other question I think we've all got to answer, which is this.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.800]   Do you see any hope?
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   Is there any way out for the individual or for society at large?
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.920]   Is there any glimmer of hope?
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.560]   These are the questions that the state of the world tonight must inevitably raise in
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.840]   the mind of any thoughtful, thinking person.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:40.920]   Well now, this is precisely the question with which the Bible deals, and in particular these
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:46.160]   three verses for which I'm now calling your attention.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.200]   I'm here to claim that it is the Bible alone which gives us an explanation of the present
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.520]   state of the world.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:02.940]   It's the Bible alone that gives us any hope whatsoever with regard to the future.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.940]   What is the matter?
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:10.080]   Why is the world as it is, in spite of all that we are aware of, by way of the advances
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.160]   of civilization, art, and culture, and poetry, and drama?
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.840]   It's wonderful, and yet why is the world as it is?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   This is the question.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.120]   It's no use merely looking at civilization and its benefits and its advances.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   We've got to look at the whole of the world and see why is it that things are as they
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.680]   are, in spite of all these marvelous, wonderful things of which we are aware.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:46.960]   Well now, the Bible's explanation is this, that man's fatal error from the very beginning
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.080]   has been this.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:59.280]   He has tended to think, and to argue, and indeed even to assume, that his own activities
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.200]   are sufficient, and that he doesn't need God.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.400]   That's the central cause of all the troubles in the world tonight.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.320]   The Bible puts it like this, that God made a perfect world, and he made men in his own
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.280]   image and likeness, and man was perfect, and he lived in a state of paradise.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.800]   Well, why are things as they are tonight?
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:30.640]   The Bible says the answer is that men, in his utter folly, rebelled against God.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:37.440]   He accepted the suggestion of the tempter that he didn't need God, that he could manage
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:46.400]   the world himself, create his own institutions, and make a perfect world.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:53.360]   This is the recurring error of men in every age and generation.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:00.000]   He likes to sing about bringing in the new Jerusalem into England's green and pleasant
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.480]   land.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.920]   This has been the fatal error.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:12.840]   It's what the Bible calls the fall of man, the original sin, man's feeling that he didn't
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:22.200]   need God, and that he himself could create a perfect world by his own energies and abilities
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   and exertions.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.500]   But, according to the Bible, this is a fatal view to take.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:38.000]   And as our text tonight puts it, these things which are made by men are things which can
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   be shaken.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.220]   You notice how he puts it, this word yet once more, "signifieth the removing of those things
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:53.620]   that are shaken as of things that are made, that those things that cannot be shaken may
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.660]   remain, wherefore we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be moved."
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.260]   Let me put it to you, therefore, like this.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.420]   Every one of us coming into this world is faced by this choice.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:16.780]   We either submit to God and his rule and his kingdom, or else we reject that and submit
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:23.060]   ourselves to the kingdoms and the ideas of man.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:32.760]   And this is the message, that all the kingdoms of man can be shaken, can be moved, and are
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:42.620]   ultimately to be destroyed, and that nothing remains and abides and is durable but the
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.660]   kingdom of God.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:51.340]   And every one of us, of course, is in one or two of these two positions.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:57.340]   We are either trusting ourselves to man and his ideas and his kingdoms, or else we are
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.660]   trusting ourselves to God and his eternal kingdom.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.980]   Now, you see the relevance of all this.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.980]   We are living in a world where so many things are collapsing round and about us.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.460]   Things which people had fondly assumed could never be shaken and never be moved.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:23.060]   So the most urgent question confronting every one of us tonight is this.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.340]   Into which of these two positions have we entered?
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.260]   To which kingdom do we belong?
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:38.020]   In order to help us in this process of self-examination, let me ask you to look with me now at these
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:47.260]   kingdoms of man which can be shaken, which can be moved, which can be destroyed.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.180]   What are they?
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.700]   The first is this.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:57.980]   Man has always been a great empire builder.
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.500]   The kingdoms of man have many forms, as I'm going to show you.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.420]   And one of the most ancient, and it's still a popular one, is the building of a great
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.420]   empire.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:15.860]   Man has always had this desire to govern and to rule.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:21.860]   And so you find throughout the whole of known history, the setting up and the appearing
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:29.820]   of great empires which seem to be all-powerful and unshakable.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.500]   Let me note just some of them to you.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.060]   You find some of them in the Bible, you find others in secular history, and very often
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.260]   they're both intermingled.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.220]   Their histories cross one another and affect one another.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:52.100]   You read in the Bible of a great kingdom known as the Kingdom of Babylon, and it was a marvelous
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   kingdom.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:59.180]   And at the head of it, there was a great king called Nebuchadnezzar, and he was a mighty
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:04.700]   military genius, a great dictator, and he appeared to have conquered the whole of the
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   known world.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.820]   And he really believed that he was invincible and that his kingdom would never come to an
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.820]   end.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:17.660]   He even began to think of himself as a god, and he made a great image of himself.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.740]   And he was ready to accept the worship of his citizens.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.300]   There he was, this apparently eternal kingdom.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:32.540]   But the Bible tells us that a day came when this great man, this great dictator, was to
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.180]   be seen like an ox in a field.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:41.520]   His hair had grown long, his nails had grown into talons, and there he was eating grass
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.700]   like the animal, humbled.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:52.620]   And eventually his great kingdom was conquered by what was known as the Medo-Persian kingdom,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.860]   the kingdom of the Medes, and especially the Persians.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:02.900]   They destroyed the great kingdom of Babylon, and so now you had another great empire that
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.980]   once more seemed to be absolutely invincible.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:14.060]   But the record tells us that a time came when this other invincible kingdom was conquered
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.580]   and was destroyed by another kingdom that came up, the kingdom of Greece.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.740]   Now, here was a very remarkable kingdom.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:29.060]   At the head of it was a man who is still known in history as Alexander the Great.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.060]   Why?
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.220]   Well, because he'd conquered everybody, and he was, of course, one of the greatest military
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:41.360]   geniuses that the world has ever known, Alexander the Great.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.780]   What happened to him and his kingdom?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:50.460]   I remember during the last war reading a commentary on the book of Daniel, the prophecy of Daniel,
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.420]   by a Swiss theologian, and he had a most striking expression.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:19:03.780]   He said, "The man that is known by the world as Alexander the Great is known in the Bible
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:11.740]   as a he-goat, and his kingdom was completely destroyed, another kingdom of Rome, the kingdom
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.700]   of Rome, and here was an amazing kingdom, Rome.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.860]   Here, at last, there really did seem to be a kingdom that could never be shaken, never
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:27.180]   be moved, and the capital was the city of Rome, and you know what they called Rome?
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.540]   The Eternal City.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:36.900]   The Eternal City, not a temporary one, the Eternal City, and this great empire was going
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:47.820]   to last forever, but you know, a man who was born 200 years from last year, namely, 1776,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:56.740]   he wrote a famous book, and the title is, "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.020]   This great empire that seemed to be eternal was destroyed by whom?
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.220]   Barbarians, Goths, Vandals.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.900]   People who came down from the north, they sacked the city of Rome, you can still visit
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:14.380]   the ruins, and the whole great Roman Empire vanished, disappeared.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.020]   Now this, you see, has been the history.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.580]   Somebody may say, "That's ancient history, what about the present time?"
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.700]   Well, it's equally true.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.060]   You remember the name of the man called Adolf Hitler?
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.820]   You remember what he said in 1933?
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:37.140]   He said that he was going to set up the Third Reich, which was going to last a thousand
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140]   years.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:45.860]   Now a great empire, the Third Reich, and he really did seem to be like a colossus striding
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   the earth, didn't he?
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.780]   How long did the Third Reich last?
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:57.280]   A thousand years, twelve years, vanished, disappeared.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.380]   I mustn't keep you with this.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.660]   I suppose many would say that the greatest empire the world has ever known was the British
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:10.140]   Empire, and we were so proud of it, weren't we?
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.300]   The British Empire, what was our boast?
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.340]   We said, "This is the empire on which the sun never sets."
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.340]   What an empire.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:28.260]   Here is the very acme, the empire on which the sun never sets, and people put their faith
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.260]   in this.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:35.420]   You didn't need God, you didn't need religion, the British Empire.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.380]   The sun never sets on it, I'm afraid it has, hasn't it?
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.820]   There's no such thing as the British Empire.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.460]   We try to cling feebly to something called the British Commonwealth of Nations, but the
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.340]   empire has gone.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.900]   You see, these things that man believes are durable and certain and everlasting, they
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.100]   can be shaken, they can be moved, and it's happening before our very eyes.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.300]   That's only one.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.740]   Another great empire that man has built has been the empire to which I've already referred
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.740]   called civilization.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.900]   I'm not here to criticize these things, I'm simply here to put facts before you.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.260]   What is civilization?
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:23.260]   Well, in addition to and over and above and more important than art in its various forms
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:30.620]   and expressions, such as you had in Greece and so on, is what is called philosophy.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   What's this?
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.060]   Well, philosophy is the love of wisdom.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:39.740]   And so people, you see, began to say towards the middle of the last century, and they've
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.700]   done it before many times, but I'm taking the modern situation particularly, they said,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.620]   "You know, we mustn't trust the Bible and its teaching.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.900]   The Bible is a collection of fairy tales, folklore, fantasies."
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:03.180]   They said, "What we want is reason, logic, understanding."
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:09.900]   So they turned their backs on the Bible, and they set up the empire, the kingdom of reason.
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.540]   Here was what was needed.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.700]   This was the thing that was going to solve all our problems.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.820]   And they detached it, you see, from its context in God, man's reason was going to solve all
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   our problems.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.700]   What's happened to this kingdom?
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:32.740]   Did you know, my friends, that this has become one of the greatest problems in the world
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.740]   tonight?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:40.700]   What is called irrationality, there is a revolt against reason.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.860]   And you know where it began?
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.580]   In the universities in America.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:52.020]   In Harvard University in America, one of the greatest universities in the world, there
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:59.660]   was a professor called Timothy Leary, and he led this revolt against reason and understanding.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:02.540]   He said, "We've lived too much in that realm, it doesn't lead anywhere.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.100]   We want feeling, we want sensation, we want experience, how are we to get it?"
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.820]   And tried many others, he said, "Ah, drugs."
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:18.020]   He was the originator, the leader in the present drug addiction, the taking of drugs, having
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:25.260]   trips, knocking out your reason, trying to get experiences and sensations.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.700]   The empire of reason has collapsed in our own day and generation.
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.900]   It can be shaken, it has been shaken.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.900]   What else?
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   Well, science, of course.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.180]   You see, this is man's trouble always.
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:43.940]   He isolates these things which are good in and of themselves, but he sets them up as
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.940]   kingdoms.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.940]   He says, "We don't need God.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   Here it is.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940]   We've got it all here."
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.100]   So many people, most people probably in this century have given up religion and attendance
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:58.560]   at places of worship because they believe that science was going to solve all our problems.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.180]   They said, "This is something solid.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:06.020]   We are dealing with facts here, not with tales and stories," and so they turned to what they
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.520]   called the laws of science.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.680]   You know, when I was a student, it's a long time ago, it's over 50 years ago.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.300]   We were taught about the laws of Newton.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.860]   They were not theories, they were laws.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:26.060]   Did you know, you will not find a single great scientist in the world tonight who believes
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.220]   in the laws of Newton.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.780]   They're gone.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.900]   Another law which we were taught was this, Dalton's law, what was that?
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.820]   And we were taught it, remember, as a law, not an idea.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:48.260]   Dalton's law said that the atom is the smallest particle of matter and that it is indivisible.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.620]   There's nothing smaller than an atom, we were told.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.060]   An atom is indivisible.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.060]   It's a law.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.380]   Would to God that Dalton had been right.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:06.380]   The world is quaking tonight because the atom has been split, and poor Dalton's law and
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.900]   his whole kingdom has been shaken into nothingness.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:10.900]   What else?
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:19.980]   Well, you see, others have said what we need is politics, not religion, not all this fancy,
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:26.580]   not all this, oh, yes, I'm sorry, the modern word is myth, the myth of God incarnate.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.260]   This is just myth.
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.260]   Facts?
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.260]   Well, facts?
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.220]   Well, you must go to these other realms, and the realm of politics.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:40.060]   And at last, they said, we've come to the very top, democracy.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:48.300]   We got rid of oligarchies, monarchies, and so on, democracy, the highest form of government.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.460]   Give it to the people, the people will decide, democracy.
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.860]   Don't want religion, soft stuff, don't put the people.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.860]   But somebody said, what if the people don't agree?
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.340]   Oh, well, they said, they may disagree about this or that, but everybody will submit to
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.620]   the rule of law.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.220]   The rule of law, you can rely on this, everybody will submit to this.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.900]   What's happened to that kingdom?
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.820]   Well, you remember, the last few years, we've been confronted by this spectacle.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:22.740]   Laws have been passed, acts have been passed in Parliament, they've become law, but certain
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.980]   powerful leaders in the country have said, I don't like that law, I'm not going to recognize
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.540]   it, I'm paying no attention to it at all.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.940]   So that one of the most urgent questions before this country tonight is this, is this country
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.700]   of ours still governable?
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   What is the future?
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:46.700]   This is the urgent problem, democracy, the kingdom of politics is quaking and shaking
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:52.220]   before our eyes and we are confronted by the possibility of a dictatorship either on the
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.460]   right or else on the left.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.460]   I must mention one other because it has been so popular, the empire of industry and trade
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.380]   and finance.
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.380]   This was our proud boast in this country, wasn't it?
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:10.340]   Not only have we got a great empire in a military sense, a great empire of trade and of commerce,
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.020]   you know it was the same.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:19.340]   If you wanted to say that something was absolutely safe and certain and sure and could never
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.780]   be removed, this is what you said.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:30.140]   You said, it's as safe as the Bank of England, as safe as the Pound Sterling, this can never
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.980]   be shaken, never be moved, the Pound Sterling, what of that?
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:40.860]   Well I understand from the authorities that the unshakeable Pound Sterling is at the moment
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:48.300]   floating, floating, and that we've had a call in the aid of some little shakes in the Middle
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.260]   East, the buttress even, the Bank of England.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.700]   My friends, isn't it about time we faced facts?
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.580]   Man and his followers, he has been isolating these various things, and above all he has
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.660]   made a kingdom of man himself.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.560]   We don't need God, look at man, look what man can do, he can split the atom, put people
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:14.100]   on the surface of, man, great man, but what is man?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.540]   I read in a learned textbook a few years back that man after all is nothing but chemistry
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.540]   and physics.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.580]   Man is a bundle of sensations, we are told.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:30.980]   So you see, everything to which man has turned, every kingdom he's tried to build, every realm
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:36.340]   that he has claimed is unshakeable is shaking before our eyes, I don't mention the realm
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340]   of morals.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:43.480]   Clever people told us you can have morality without religion, teach people, children in
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.380]   school how to behave, you don't need religion, they said, for morality, we can teach morality
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.820]   and as people become educated, they live a good life.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.820]   What's happened to it?
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:03.020]   We are all aware of the moral confusion in this country, promiscuity, infidelity, divorce,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:13.700]   laxity, looseness, pornography, the age of permissiveness, everything shaking, no rules,
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.180]   no ideas, no fundamentals, the whole world is in a state of confusion.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:22.420]   Well now, my friends, this is the great fundamental statement of the Bible.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.880]   It doesn't matter what kingdom you set up, and it may be art, don't forget that in connection
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.140]   with this festival.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.060]   If you think you can live by art and that art is going to solve the problems of the
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.860]   world, you're equally in error.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.580]   All these kingdoms that man thinks are going to be durable and are going to solve our problems,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.100]   every one of them is shaking, every one of them can be shaking.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.780]   This is the ultimate fallacy.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.260]   Why is this so?
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.620]   The biblical answer is, the only answer is this, we've got it in our text.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:31:01.020]   This word yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.660]   that are made, they're all made.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:13.540]   Man has made them all, and man, you see, is finite, he's too small, man's too small to
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.100]   build a universe.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.420]   He only sees a little segment of truth.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:25.860]   Everything he does is made, it's produced, he only sees portions of reality and of truth.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:33.420]   So his whole concept at his best is too small for us to live on and to bank on.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:39.180]   But not only is man small, he is sinful.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.820]   There's an element of decay in everything we make.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.820]   Why?
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:47.460]   Because in us, man is sinful by nature.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.980]   He's a creature of jealousy and envy and malice and spite.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:57.460]   Read the biographies, read the biographies of these statesmen, read the biographies of
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.140]   poets and of essayists and of artists and all the others, and you'll find that because
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:08.620]   they're human, like everybody else, they're creatures of lust and of passion and of desire,
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.780]   they're jealous and envious of one another, they're rival schools and they're quarreling.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.500]   So everything that man makes has got a seed of decay in it.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.060]   There's something wrong about it.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.740]   He can't make anything perfect because he himself is imperfect.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:30.540]   So our Lord said, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust doth
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.500]   corrupt and thieves break through and steal.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.540]   Don't lay up your treasures there.
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.860]   These things are all right, but don't turn them into empires.
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.860]   Don't live for them.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:50.060]   It'll all let you down, the moth and the rust corrupt and thieves break through and steal.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:58.900]   But over and above it all, according to this teaching, the wrath of God is upon it all.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.620]   Man is not an independent creature, and he has no right to set up his kingdoms.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.220]   He's made by God, he's made for God.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:17.860]   And as long as he rebels against God, God will blow upon his every effort, and it'll
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.860]   come to nothing.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.980]   Now, this is what we're told here.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.140]   These kingdoms can all be shaken and be removed.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.060]   This is the great message of the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.500]   And our world is as it is tonight because man in his cleverness is not believing this
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.320]   book and trusting to his own ideas.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.220]   And you know, the fact is that the really great thinkers of the past, quite apart from
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.420]   the Bible, have overseen this.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.460]   Look at Shakespeare.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.340]   Shakespeare saw this quite clearly.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.180]   He puts it into the mouth of Prospero in The Tempest.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:04.540]   Our rebels now are ended, unlike the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capped towers,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:14.260]   the sullen temples, the great globe itself, yea, all which it shall inherit shall dissolve.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:23.740]   And like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:33.860]   We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded in a dream.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:41.580]   Yes, my friends, pageants, festivals, empires, politics, all these things to which man has
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:48.300]   entrusted and in which he's put his faith, they're all coming to an end, this insubstantial
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.060]   pageant faded.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.420]   Leave not a rack behind.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:01.940]   We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.180]   That's right until the last statement.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:09.820]   Shakespeare thought that death is the end, that death is just a sleep, and our little
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.980]   life is rounded with a sleep.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.260]   I'm going to show you that that's not true.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.340]   It'll be very comforting to think, perhaps, that it did end in a sleep and nothingness,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340]   but it doesn't.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.340]   There, you see, are the kingdoms of men.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.380]   They can all be shaken, they can all be moved, and it's happening before our eyes.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.380]   Is there any hope therefore?
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.380]   There is.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:36.180]   There is a kingdom which cannot be moved, and it's the only one.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.540]   What is it?
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:43.020]   What is there in this world tonight on which we can bank, knowing for certain that it will
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.020]   never be shaken, never be moved?
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.460]   Well, the first thing, according to those men, is this word.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.260]   He says this word yet once more.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:58.580]   He said already in verse 25, "See that he refutes not him that speaketh."
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.540]   There is a word, and thank God there is.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.940]   It's the only hope tonight.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:09.020]   You still see hope in politics, you still see hope in philosophy, they're all shifting,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.180]   they're all drifting, they're all floating.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.580]   You see any hope anywhere.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.600]   Here's the only hope, this word.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.260]   This man starts his great epistle by saying this, "God, who at sundry times and in divers
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:29.180]   manners speak in times past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   unto us."
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:38.220]   There's a word that comes into us tonight, there's a word that can never be moved, never
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.220]   be shaken.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.580]   Do you remember what our Lord Christ said?
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:49.540]   "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away."
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:55.180]   Here is something that is indestructible, durable, everlasting.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:59.660]   Listen to the Apostle Peter saying it, "Being born again not of corruptible seed, but of
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.980]   incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:13.900]   For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of men, his kingdom, his politics, his art,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:21.740]   his culture, his civilization, all the glory of men, like the flower of grass, the grass
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:29.700]   withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; but the word of the Lord endureth forever."
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.780]   And this is the word which by the gospel is spoken unto you.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.700]   Why is this word durable?
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.340]   The answer is it's the word of God.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.940]   Here alone is the word of God.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.380]   This isn't a human theory, these are not human suppositions and ideas.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:56.180]   God speak, God's word, and because it's God's word it can never be shaken.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:06.140]   "Frail as summer's flowers we flourish, blows the wind and it is gone, but while mortals
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:17.220]   rise and perish, God endures, unchanging on, we blossom and flourish like leaves on the
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:29.100]   tree and wither and perish, but not change of thee, God, from everlasting to everlasting,
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.100]   the great Creator."
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.100]   Didn't you hear it in the anthem just now?
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.180]   "The heavens declare the glory of God."
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.420]   This is what men have forgotten.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.980]   They think that their representation of the heavens and their art is something in and
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   of itself.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   It isn't.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:51.260]   If you don't see God in your art, your art is valueless and it's going to decay, it'll
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.260]   be moth-eaten.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:39:00.340]   "The heavens declare the glory of God, because he is the great Jehovah, from everlasting
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:06.100]   to everlasting, the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.100]   turning."
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   And this is God's word.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.100]   What is it?
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.100]   What does it tell us?
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.540]   Well, it tells us that we are created beings, that we are not lords, we are not masters
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.780]   of our fate, that we are too small to build our empires and universes.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.460]   It tells us more that we are sinners, that we've rebelled against our maker and brought
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.340]   chaos down upon ourselves.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.820]   It explains the state of the world tonight, in spite of all our education.
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.820]   Look at the world.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:38.300]   It's because man is a sinner and a disobedient rebel against God.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:44.980]   And it tells us more, that we are without excuse, for God has told us how to live.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.500]   That's the meaning of the Ten Commandments, which God gave to man.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:53.660]   And if only the world lived according to the Ten Commandments tonight, most of our problems
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:54.660]   would be solved.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   What are they?
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.060]   You mustn't worship nobody but God.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.860]   You mustn't worship art, you mustn't worship literature, you mustn't worship politics
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.860]   or statesmen.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   God alone is to be worshiped.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:03.860]   What else?
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   "Honor thy father and mother."
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.860]   "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.860]   "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy father and mother."
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.860]   "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.860]   "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:13.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.860]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:25.780]   "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:32.300]   "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor his manservant,
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   nor his maidservant."
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:38.620]   These are God's laws, and God has told us from the beginning that if we break his laws,
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   we'll have misery.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.980]   "The way of the transgressor is hard," says the Bible.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   God says it.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.420]   "There is no peace," says my God, "to the wicked."
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.740]   With all our cleverness, with all our wealth, with all our culture, with everything we've
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.500]   got, there's no peace, is there?
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.060]   Look at the divorce statistics.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.260]   Look at the breakdown of family life.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.500]   Look at the chaos amongst us.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.100]   "There is no peace," says my God, "to the wicked."
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:08.380]   However clever, however able, however wonderful the thing you make is, it's a thing that is
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.380]   made, and it'll be shaken, it'll be destroyed.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:18.060]   God has always said this, and finally tells us that man at the end is a responsible being,
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.980]   and he's going to be judged by God.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:27.300]   And whether we like it or not, my friends, we have all got to die, and death is not the
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   end.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.740]   It's not the sleep that Shakespeare speaks of.
[00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.700]   Anything that doesn't prepare you for that is finally useless.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:41.300]   And the tragedy of the world tonight is that men and women have forgotten God and are living
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.900]   according to their various ideas, some better than others.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:50.980]   But if God is left out, it is all vanity, vanity, nothing but vanity.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.180]   But thank God the Word of God doesn't leave us at that.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   That's negative.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   That's condemnation.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:07.300]   It tells us that God, in his infinite grace and love and compassion, is preparing a kingdom
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.780]   which is lasting, which cannot be moved, God's kingdom.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   What's this?
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.780]   Well, God first promised it even in the Garden of Eden.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.180]   He went to the men and the women after they had sinned, and he said, "There's going to
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:24.020]   be enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent because of your disobedience,
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:29.620]   but the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.900]   God is going to send a deliverer.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.580]   We can be delivered by God's grace, and the whole of the Old Testament is nothing but
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.660]   an account in parts and portions, pieces, as this man says in chapter 1, of how God
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.620]   was setting up this kingdom.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.900]   Through the prophets, he said, "The Messiah, the King, is coming," and when the fullness
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:55.060]   of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.580]   The King has come on earth to establish his kingdom, and he's given us the message to
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.500]   tell people to flee from the wrath to come, to escape out of the kingdoms of men that
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.980]   are vanishing, and to enter into his eternal kingdom.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:15.740]   And here, this man especially, in this addition to the Hebrew, reminds us that there's only
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.260]   one way of entering that kingdom, one only.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.660]   What's that?
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.740]   It is to believe in Jesus Christ and in Jehovah.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.820]   He is the only way of escape.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:33.420]   No man can save us, but God has spoken unto us in his own Son.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:38.100]   Jesus of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.020]   He took on to him human nature in order to redeem it.
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:48.740]   He's borne the penalty of our sin, he's borne our punishment in his own body on the cross.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:54.420]   It is by his stripes we are healed, in him alone and his resurrection we are reconciled
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   to God.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:00.540]   We can be delivered out of the kingdom of darkness and translated into the kingdom of
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.140]   God's dear Son.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.820]   It's the only way.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.100]   Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, none of these things help us.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:15.420]   It is Jesus Christ and him crucified, and he alone and exclusively.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   That's the word.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:23.180]   This is as certain tonight as it was 100 years ago, 1,000 years ago, nearly 2,000 years ago.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:31.500]   And thank God, in addition to this great and glorious message, that tells us that in spite
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:36.740]   of our folly, we can be forgiven and reconciled to God.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:43.520]   We can start a new life, we can be born again, we can be given a new nature and a new outlook
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.940]   and a new hope because this Christ, when he was here on earth, did everything necessary
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:54.700]   to reconcile us to God, has returned to heaven, but he'll come again and judge the whole world
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.740]   in righteousness.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.180]   You think this whole world is going to end as it is?
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   Certainly not.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:08.020]   It's God's world, and God is going to judge it in righteousness by the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:13.460]   who will come again into it, not as the babe of Bethlehem, but as the King of kings and
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.300]   the Lord of lords, riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.340]   He'll come conquering and to conquer.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:27.140]   Let your communism, your humanism, your rationalism, and all your isms do their worst.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.940]   His kingdom is invincible.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:38.540]   His kingdom cannot fail because it is his kingdom, and we are surrounded by his exceeding
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.520]   great and precious promises.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.500]   His name tells us in chapter 6 that God, in order to encourage us, has even sworn an oath.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.060]   He's sworn by himself.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:52.900]   He's taken a double oath, and he said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:58.180]   Whatever happens, if revolution should come in this country, if a bomb should be let off,
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:02.900]   if we are suffering under a tyranny, God's promise still holds.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:08.700]   I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, and Christ has gone to prepare a place for
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:09.700]   us.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:16.360]   And to all who believe in him, there is an inheritance which is incorruptible and undefiled
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:23.120]   and that fadeth not away, reserved in him for us by God.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:32.340]   There, my friends, is the only thing we can be certain of tonight, in which these kingdoms
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.340]   are you.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:36.660]   We are all in one or the other.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:42.000]   You either belong to the world and man's kingdom, or you belong to the kingdom of God.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.640]   If you're in the kingdom of God, you can sing like this, "Glorious things of thee are spoken,
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:57.280]   Zion, city of our God, he whose word cannot be broken, form thee for his own abode on
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.800]   the rock of ages founded.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:21.960]   What can shake thy sure repose, with salvation's walls surrounded, thou mayst smile at all
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   thy foes."
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   Are you in a kingdom that can be shaken?
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   Face the fact.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   There's only one that cannot be shaken, the kingdom of God.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:34.560]   My conclusion is this, "Change and decay in all around thy seed.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:42.440]   O thou who changest not, abide with me."
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:52.120]   You offer that prayer and you'll find he will never leave you, nor forsake you, let us pray.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:58.640]   "O Lord our God, we come to thee and thank thee that in spite of our sin and rebellion,
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:06.560]   our arrogance and our unutterable folly, by thine infinite grace and compassion, thou
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.520]   hast prepared this kingdom for us.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:20.000]   Even at the expense of the death of thy dear son and his burial in a grave, O God, that
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   is risen again, and thy kingdom cannot fail.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:33.600]   Lord, open the eyes of the blind and stop death here, for while there is still time,
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:41.560]   God save the people, and unto thee, and unto thee alone, shall we give all the praise and
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:49.720]   all the honor and all the glory, both now and forever, amen."
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
