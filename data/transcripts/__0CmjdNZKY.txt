[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, is my body my friend or is my body my foe?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's a question we must ask and answer and we can with Scripture.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The question comes in from an anonymous woman.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I'm a Christian female in my 20s.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Ever since puberty I have hated my body.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   I constantly feel uncomfortable in my own skin and obsess about what other people might be thinking about it.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   In the last 8 years of my life I'm not sure I've gone a full minute without having intrusive, destructive, and negative thoughts about my physical appearance.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Sometimes I wonder if I have a mental illness and I know the value of having this checked out by a doctor, and I have.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   But I would love biblical help from you.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Scripture says I was fearfully and wonderfully made and that God doesn't look at the outward appearance but looks at my heart.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I believe these things are true, but what about my view of myself?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   What would you say to me?"
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I hope we all understand and agree that I know very, very little about this situation
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and cannot presume to speak into it with the kind of wisdom that would come from knowing not only Scripture but also the person in the situation.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   So let's all agree that what I say is not a simplistic remedy for what sounds like a deep and lasting problem,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   but rather a biblical perspective that might, along with other factors, be used by God to bring freedom.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   That would be my prayer.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I want to respond to three statements that you made and just give a biblical angle on those three statements that you made that may help or maybe you haven't thought about.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Number one, you said, "Ever since puberty, I have hated my body."
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I wonder if it might be worth considering that there is a good hatred of the body and a bad hatred of the body.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   The Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:26, "I pommel my body, literally, I give my body a black eye and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified."
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You don't beat up on your friend.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You beat up on your enemies.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Now, of course, the body in one sense is a friend.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   There's no life on earth without it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It does make some pleasures possible.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It will be raised on the last day and made beautiful and glorious for every single child of God.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But there's another sense in which the body is not a friend.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It has become the base of operations for much enemy activity, and it has become complicit in that attack of the evil one on us.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Paul knows it, and he hates that aspect of the body, and he will not let the body rule him or destroy him.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   He says in Romans 7:24, "Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And he means the body that he is in as Paul, which tempts him to do things that will lead to death.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So Paul has an ambivalent view of the body.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   He doesn't want to throw it away in suicide or mutilate it in some unhealthy way, but he prefers resurrection.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   He doesn't want it to vanish.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He knows God gave us a body for a reason, and yet while he's here on the earth,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   the enemy has made his body complicit in his destruction, and he hates it in the sense that he opposes it and will not let the body destroy him.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So my question is, have you ever asked, maybe instead of saying, "I should stop hating my body.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I should stop hating my body."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Maybe you should say, "I should start hating my body in the right way.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I should start hating my body because it tempts me to sin."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Not because it's any particular shape or disfiguration or has a certain complexion or whatever it is,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   but rather, "Is the body what is making me sin against God?"
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And in that sense, shift all of your hatred, which would be a very significant liberation.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Do you cherish your body as the vehicle of God-given earthly life that will one day be made a glorious body in the resurrection when you will shine like the sun?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Maybe it will help if you, instead of trying to completely rid yourself of body hate,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   shift the battle onto hating the way you should rather than not hating at all.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That's my first response to the first statement.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Here's the second statement that you made.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   You said, "I believe these things are true, namely that God has made you fearfully and wonderfully and looks upon the heart.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I believe these things are true, but what about my view and myself?"
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "What would you say to me?" you said.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   "The question I want to ask is, what do you mean by 'I believe these things'—these things that God has said about you?"
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You say that God has a perspective on you as fearful and wonderfully made.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   You say that God looks upon your heart.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And then you say that you have a perspective, and it is different from God's, and you believe God's.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then you ask me, "What about my perspective?"
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And my response is, "What do you mean you believe God's perspective?"
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Have you ever thought that believing God in the New Testament—believing in the New Testament—
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   is more than intellectual assent to the truth of something?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Believing in the New Testament means receiving, embracing, loving.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   For example, in John 1:12, "To all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become the children of God."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Believing Christ is receiving Christ, welcoming Christ, embracing Christ as true and beautiful and satisfying.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Or 2 Thessalonians 2:10, where Paul refers to unbelievers as those who "refused to love the truth and so be saved,"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   which means that believing the truth includes loving the truth.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The devils believe and tremble.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   If you believe what God says, you love the fact that he said it.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You embrace it.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It becomes part of what satisfies your soul.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   God's perspective is precious if it's believed.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It's precious.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We embrace it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We kiss it.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Jesus said, "Whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Believing Jesus means believing that who he is and what he says are thirst-quenching, soul-satisfying.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So I ask you, what do you mean when you say, "I believe God's perspective about me is true"?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Do you?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Lastly, number three, you say, "I constantly feel uncomfortable."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   In fact, you said there's not been a minute for eight years.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   "I constantly feel uncomfortable in my own skin and obsess about what other people might be thinking about it."
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Let's think about obsessing.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Sometimes when we are obsessing about something, we make the mistake of thinking we can stop obsessing about it by focusing directly on the problem of obsession.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But that never works, does it?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Because in the very focusing on the problem of obsession, we continue to obsess.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The absolutely crucial need is to set our minds on things different and greater than ourselves.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   When Paul said, "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   That includes your body.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   "Set your mind on things that are above, not on your body."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Have you perhaps considered that the room you live in is too small?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I mean the world you have made for yourself, the world of obsessing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   And the walls in this little room, this world that you live in, are all made out of mirrors.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So you live in a little room, the world you've made, and all the walls in the little world, this room, are mirrors.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   The battle with obsession will not be won by desperately trying not to see yourself in this room, or trying to like what you see in this room.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   The problem is that the room is too small.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   What needs to happen is that the whole room needs to be blown up.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Not that you be blown up, but the littleness, the confined, cramped smallness of the world you live in needs to be blown up.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   All the walls need to be blown out by the majesty and greatness and unimaginable expansiveness of God.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Many of the problems that we try to deal with are absolutely unsolvable because the solution lies not in adjusting things in the little room where we live,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   but in blowing out all the walls of the room where we live so that we suddenly find ourselves staggered by the grandeur of God and His creation.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And this staggering experience turns out to be an expansive universe and world where we can live not just for a minute, but a week or a month or a year,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   and suddenly realize we haven't thought about ourselves at all, good or bad.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   That's freedom.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   That's glorious freedom.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Freedom is not finally liking the body that you see in the mirror of the little room of your world.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Freedom is having the walls blown away and being so staggered by the world and its grandeur and the greatness of the God who made it
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that the last thing you would worry about or think about is yourself.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You would be drawn outside yourself in a stunning, glorious, freeing way.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Amen. So important to be drawn outside of ourselves.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And this idea of self-hatred and body image is an important one that the church, I think, has really only begun to wrestle with, it seems to me.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And there's so much more to think about and to apply here in our lives.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And if you want more on this theme, I recorded a 50-minute conversation with Bible counselor David Powleson,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   which is titled "Gospel Hope for Self-Haters," which can be found at DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I found that conversation really helpful.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Thank you for making this podcast, the Ask Pastor John podcast, a part of your day.

[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Well, how does God's sovereignty over everyone not make each of us robots?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Where is the place for human will, and how does God govern over everything, even human decision-making?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It's a great question, and it comes from a listener in Nebraska, my home state.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki. We'll see you on Wednesday for that.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   (end)
