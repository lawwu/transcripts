[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.420]   - Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.600]   We have a big week ahead in a trio of episodes
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.660]   related to the Reformation this week.
[00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.080]   And it's gonna begin with this one
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.720]   with a question from a listener named David.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.840]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.040]   The big anniversary of the Reformation
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.920]   is coming up at the end of this month.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.560]   So this question is pressing to me.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.280]   Which of the five solas is the heart of the Reformation?
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.120]   Which one is most important?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.960]   Is it sola scriptura, scripture alone?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.160]   Sola fide, faith alone?
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.600]   Sola gratia, grace alone?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240]   Solus Christus, Christ alone?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.120]   Or soli deo gloria, to the glory of God alone?
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.100]   Pastor John, how would you answer David?
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.920]   - I can't answer this question
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.960]   any more than I can answer
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.120]   which wing of an airplane is most important.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.640]   Or what's most important,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.520]   the wings or the jet engines.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.880]   If a wing goes, the plane crashes.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.160]   And if one of the solas goes,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.560]   salvation crashes.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   This is, I think, in fact,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880]   why the Reformation was and remains such a huge issue.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's not as though a person can cherry pick
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.780]   parts of God's plan to save sinners
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.680]   while neglecting the others or distorting the others
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.760]   and still hope to see sinners saved.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.480]   I think the most helpful thing to do
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.480]   would be to explain why these solas are needed
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   and what they are and why they are so connected
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.100]   that if one goes, the rest can't save.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.260]   The reason they're so needed,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.240]   the whole issue is the issue of salvation.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.240]   All human beings are sinners, Romans 3:23.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   That means two things about each of us
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.300]   that we can't fix by our own initiative.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.140]   One is that we are spiritually dead in our trespasses,
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.900]   Ephesians 2, one to five.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   We have to have spiritual life
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.980]   and we can't make that life happen, we're dead.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.620]   We have to be born again.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.760]   And the other is that we're under God's wrath.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.160]   God is just and hates sin.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   And in his justice, he aims to deal justly
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   with sinners and punish us.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.080]   So one, we need life, which we can't create.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.060]   And two, we need God's wrath to be turned away.
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.520]   We need him to be 100% for us and not against us.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.240]   And in our guilt, we can't make that happen.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.080]   That's the double problem that God himself
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.700]   has solved through the gospel
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.660]   and the Reformation was reclaiming
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.300]   how God solves those two problems.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300]   And the five solas explain how we get saved.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.800]   And the answer of the Protestant Reformation is this.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.840]   Our being made alive in Christ
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   and God's being 100% for us forever
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.000]   is by God's grace alone, on the basis of Christ alone,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.080]   received through faith alone,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.040]   so that all things lead ultimately
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.600]   to the glory of God alone,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   with scripture alone as the only final decisive authority
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.200]   for discerning and teaching and defending those truths.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.720]   That's the way the alones go together.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.360]   The word grace implies free gift,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.880]   not earned, not merited, not deserved,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.680]   which means that our new birth,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   our being given life was God's doing freely as a gift.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   We did not make it happen.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.920]   We were dead.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.400]   Our new life, our desire, our ability to believe and love
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.440]   is all of grace, which is exactly what Paul says
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.920]   in Ephesians 2:5, "He made us alive.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.320]   By grace, you have been saved."
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.840]   And it's the same with God's removal of his own wrath.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   He says in Romans 3:24, "We are justified by his grace
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.520]   as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   whom God put forward as a propitiation."
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.680]   That is a removal of wrath by his blood.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   So God himself, without any of our doing or acting
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.240]   completely canceled our debt on the cross,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.040]   bought that deliverance for us,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   propitiated his own wrath by his grace as a gift.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   We added nothing to this transaction on the cross.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.480]   It was grace alone, not grace plus some of our merit
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.960]   or some of the saints' merits or some of Mary's merits.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   It was Christ and grace alone.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.520]   So there's the key.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.040]   What I could not do, could not contribute anything at all,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.640]   God did, paying for my sins,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.000]   propitiating his wrath at the cross,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.160]   and then raising me from the dead,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.480]   both by grace alone, meaning the free gift
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.680]   cannot be added to by my merit or effort
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   or anybody else's merit or effort.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.520]   Now, here's why they all stand and fall together.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.360]   It's amazing how the Bible gives us
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.440]   explicit answers to this.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.240]   So let me go through it quickly.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.720]   Grace, first grace alone and Christ alone.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Galatians 2.21, "I do not nullify the grace of God.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.040]   For if righteousness were through the law,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   then Christ died for no purpose."
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.120]   Meaning, Galatians 5.2, "If you accept circumcision,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.760]   Christ will be of no advantage to you."
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   In other words, Christ alone is the ground
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   of God's being 100% for us,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.600]   not Christ plus circumcision
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.800]   or any other human act or merit.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.480]   If you add to Christ as the ground
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.000]   of God's being 100% for you,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.520]   Paul says, "Grace is nullified."
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.560]   So in Paul's mind, Christ alone and grace alone
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.040]   stand and fall together.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.680]   Second, grace alone and faith alone.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.640]   Romans 4.14, "If it is the adherence of the law
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.000]   who are to be heirs, faith is null."
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.920]   Nullified, just like grace was.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.600]   "And the promise is void."
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.440]   Here it is.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.560]   "It depends on faith in order that the promise
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.720]   may rest on grace."
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.200]   In other words, if God's blessings of new life
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   and no wrath are free gifts of grace,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.180]   the only way a human may enjoy them
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.560]   is by receiving the gift, not doing.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.280]   Faith, not law-keeping.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.500]   If you add to faith as a means of receiving
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   new birth and justification, you nullify grace,
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.480]   Paul says in Romans 4.16.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.320]   Faith alone and grace alone stand and fall together.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.000]   Third, grace alone and glory of God alone.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Ephesians 1.6 says, "The entire design of salvation
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.160]   by grace from before the foundation of the world
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   was that the glory of grace would be praised.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.020]   He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.200]   through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of his will,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.900]   to the praise of the glory of his grace."
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.180]   In other words, if adding to Christ
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.180]   as the ground of God's being 100% for us nullifies grace,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.820]   and if adding to faith as the means of enjoying
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   the gift of God being 100% for us nullifies grace,
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.940]   then the great aim of it all in the praise
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.940]   of the glory of that grace will be nullified as well.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.660]   The reason God gives life and justifies this way,
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.900]   by grace alone, on the ground of Christ alone,
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.380]   through faith alone, is because he aims
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.220]   for the final and ultimate glory
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.660]   for it all to go to himself alone.
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.900]   That's what Paul says in Romans 11.36.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.900]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.060]   To him be glory forever and ever, amen.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.300]   And all of this can only be known and believed
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.860]   and enjoyed and taught with final and decisive authority
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.540]   from the scripture alone.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.900]   So here's my conclusion.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.900]   Therefore, for the sake of the gospel
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.340]   of new life and justification by God's grace alone,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:13.620]   on the basis of Christ alone, received by faith alone,
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.420]   so that all things lead ultimately to the glory of God alone,
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.420]   we take our stand with confidence and joy
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.820]   on the final decisive authority of scripture alone.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.820]   They all, all the solas, stand or fall together.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.140]   - Amen, such a great overview of the theological glories
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.980]   of the Protestant Reformation and how they are
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.200]   so inseparably wedded together.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.420]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening

[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.780]   Well, as I mentioned on Friday,
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.500]   with the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.200]   coming up later this month, we have set aside
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.400]   the month of October to reflect on what God has done
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   through Luther and Calvin and all the many personalities
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.660]   that God used in the Reformation.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.800]   It took a huge team to pull off by God's grace,
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.600]   and we've been celebrating many of these voices,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.100]   many of these people at Desiring God
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.640]   in a daily series called Here We Stand,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.040]   31 Heroes of the Reformation.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.680]   It's a series of articles and also a podcast
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.080]   you can subscribe to via iTunes.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.880]   Each day through the month of October,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.160]   we're publishing a brief daily character sketch
