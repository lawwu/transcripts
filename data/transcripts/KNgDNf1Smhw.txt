[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello everyone.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.020]   Well, it's, it's certainly not easy to apply all of the New Testament to our
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.140]   lives, but it's certainly easier than trying to apply to our lives all the
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.600]   things that we read about in the massive Old Testament.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.040]   So what role does the Old Testament play in our Christian lives?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.260]   That's the question today.
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.080]   And it comes from a listener named Sarah.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.640]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.320]   Thank you for your ministry faithfulness over the years to this podcast and for
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   fielding my question, generally speaking, the Old Testament is still very valuable
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.260]   to us, obviously, but to what extent now that the new covenant has arrived, God
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.620]   doesn't require animal sacrifices for our sins.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.120]   So what are the best uses of the Old Testament for giving shape
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.040]   to our Christian lives today?
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.400]   Let me begin with the recommendation of a book.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.280]   Jason Deroushi, D-E-R-O-U-C-H-I-E, published a book called How to
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.840]   Understand and Apply the Old Testament.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.000]   It has a huge section in it on the practical uses of the
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   Old Testament for our day.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.920]   Jason is the professor of Old Testament at Bethlehem College and Seminary, and I
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.680]   just listened to a message of his just a few days ago about how the Old Testament
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.520]   is not just turned into useful Christian scripture for our own Christian living,
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.960]   but was intended by God and by the authors themselves of the Old Testament
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.160]   to be used that way beyond their own day in the distant future, including our time.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.440]   You can probably find that message, by the way, at the audio or video section
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.080]   over at Bethlehem College and Seminary website.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.400]   This is a huge issue that Sarah raises, but I think I can say just two or three
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.120]   things that will help her feel how precious and wonderful and useful the Old
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.280]   Testament is for our Christian life today.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.240]   The first thing to say is that when Jesus Christ came into the world as the long
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.280]   expected Messiah of the Old Testament, a profound and dramatic change happened in
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.320]   the way we handle Old Testament scripture.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.080]   And this is because Jesus was the fulfillment.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.480]   That's the key New Testament word, the fulfillment and the goal of so much Old
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240]   Testament religion.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.880]   For example, Jesus was the fulfillment of all the Old Testament animal sacrifices,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   which were offered as a temporary way of pointing to the way God covers sins.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.160]   So the entire sacrificial system comes to an end in Jesus.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.440]   Doesn't need to be done anymore because Jesus was the decisive sacrifice of
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.040]   himself.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.600]   He also is the high priest, the final, decisive, finish it high priest who
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.680]   mediates between man and God so that the sacrificial system and the priestly
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   ministry of the sacrifices go away.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   We have a high priest that takes us right into the throne of grace personally.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.240]   And that means that the ceremonial laws surrounding that entire system also
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.840]   undergo a dramatic change because Mark says in his gospel, Jesus declared all
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.360]   foods clean.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.400]   So you can see how the ceremonial law that we're attaching to those processes,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.600]   those ceremonies, are also altered.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.240]   And when the gospel spills over to the banks of the Gentile world and not just
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.480]   ethnic Israel, so that the Gentiles are now included in the Abrahamic people of
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.400]   God, that ethnocentricity and earthly political theocentric approach of the
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   civil government in the Old Testament, that undergoes a dramatic change because
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.000]   the church today is not one ethnicity with an earthly homeland with its own
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.720]   form of civil government.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.600]   Instead, the church is a scattered people who are exiles and sojourners among all
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.080]   the nations of the world, functioning as refugees in all kinds of alien political
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.400]   systems, as representatives of the true heavenly citizenship.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.920]   That's a radically different form of being a people of God than the Jewish
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.840]   people were in the Old Testament.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.920]   So you can see from just those few examples, and there would be others, that
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.560]   when we read the Old Testament, we are, by its own intention, as Jason Deroshi
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.360]   showed me so well a few days ago, we are making the necessary changes of
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.600]   application for our day.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.560]   But nothing I've said in all that should be construed to imply that the
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   Scriptures are not profoundly useful today.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   All of them.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.960]   All of them.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.080]   Second Timothy 3.16, all Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   Christians, he says.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.880]   Not just a few scattered nice points like Isaiah 53.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.760]   All of it is profitable.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.360]   And there are two reasons for that that I'll mention.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.120]   There are others, lots of others, probably.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.040]   One, God has not changed.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.720]   Therefore, wherever we rightly understand His character and His ways in the Old
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.120]   Testament, we are learning something true about the God and Father of our Lord
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.480]   Jesus Christ, who loved us and sent Christ to die for us.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:53.880]   Number two, when Christ died, His blood secured for us a joyful participation, a
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.640]   full participation as Gentiles in all the promises of God in the Old Testament.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.160]   This is one of the most important truths that Sarah, in asking this question,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.680]   should take hold of with all her might.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.440]   It's certainly the one that means most to me.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.120]   Here's the way Paul expresses it in 2 Corinthians 1.20.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.680]   All the promises of God find their yes in Jesus.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.480]   That is why it is through Him we utter our amen to the glory of God.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.720]   That is an absolutely glorious, amazing, wonderful, stunning, precious sentence.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.960]   When you read the Old Testament, there are promises upon promises upon promises
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.320]   made to God's people, and in Christ they are yours.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.880]   You're now grafted in, in Christ, into the seed, Paul says in Galatians 3, and as
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.960]   the seed of Israel, you benefit from all the promises made to Israel, you become
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.560]   part of the Abrahamic hope of the world.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.920]   Here's one example, maybe two examples of how this works.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.280]   So Hebrews 13, verses 5 and 6 says, "Keep your life free from the love of money.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.640]   Be content with what you have."
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.440]   And here's how he argues.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:30.360]   "For He has said," and then he quotes Joshua 1.5, words given to Joshua, "I
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.960]   will never leave you or forsake you."
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.920]   And then he continues, "So we can confidently say," and then he quotes
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.200]   Psalm 118, verse 6, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.160]   I will not fear.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.120]   What can man do to me?"
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   Do you see how he's doing this?
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.120]   This is what we do.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.200]   We hear the command, "Be content, keep your life free from the love of money."
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.360]   But how can I answer, "Go to Joshua, go to the Psalms, and you'll hear promises
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.400]   that will steady your heart and make you peaceful."
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.160]   That's amazing.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.400]   Here's one more example from Romans 12, 19 and 20.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.720]   Paul is arguing that Christians should not return evil for evil.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.120]   How does he argue?
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   Here's how he does it.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.600]   Verse 19 of Romans 12, "Beloved, never avenge yourselves.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.960]   Leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written."
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.720]   Where?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.680]   Deuteronomy 32, verse 5, "Vengeance is mine.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.480]   I will repay, says the Lord."
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.720]   Then he continues, only this time without even telling us.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.880]   He's quoting the entirety of Proverbs 25, 21, and 22.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.000]   "To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.600]   If he's thirsty, give him something to drink.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.760]   By so doing, you'll reap coals of fire, burning coals upon his head."
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.480]   And on and on it goes in the New Testament.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.400]   So my limited, but I hope significant and helpful suggestion for Sarah is that two
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.600]   glorious uses of the Old Testament today are these.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:18.440]   One, meeting God for who he really is so that we can know him and worship him since his
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.640]   character was revealed as truly in the Old Testament as in the New.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.560]   That's first one.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.840]   And two, letting the hundreds of promises in the Old Testament wash over you as your
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   blood-bought birthright in Christ Jesus so that every day you set yourself free from
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.120]   sin by the superior pleasures of the promises of God.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.200]   Amen.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.280]   Amen and amen.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.400]   Thank you, Pastor John, for modeling this earnest reading of the Old Testament over
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   the years and for seeking to find glimpses of God's revealed glory in Scripture and so
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.760]   often capturing the promises and then sharing those things with us all on Twitter,
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.320]   where a lot of those discoveries find a home.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   Thank you for modeling this very approach to the Old Testament.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.680]   And thank you for listening and making the podcast a part of your week.

[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.040]   Bye.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   Bye.
