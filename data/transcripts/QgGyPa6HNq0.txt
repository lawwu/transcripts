[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the first verse in the first chapter
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.720]   of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians. The epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:21.120]   and the first verse. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:30.320]   are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:42.000]   the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.760]   Now here the apostle begins his letter and at once he does something that is so characteristic
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.480]   of him and indeed which is characteristic of all the writers of these New Testament
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.800]   epistles. And that is that at once, as it were, they plunge right into the midst of
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.400]   great and profound truth. I suppose we all up to a point must plead guilty to the tendency
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.240]   to regard these introductions of these New Testament epistles as being more or less formal.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.360]   We all have a tendency to believe always that all introductions are more or less unnecessary,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.240]   something that we can skip over in order that we may hurry on to the great message. That
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.120]   kind of childish attitude tends to persist with us throughout life. We always wanted
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.360]   to get at the heart of a story and were impatient with all the preliminaries and the introductions.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.160]   We wanted the excitement. And that habit, I say, tends to persist so that when we come
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.320]   even to a New Testament epistle, we feel the preliminary words of salutation. While they
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.000]   are very nice, of course, and polite, and the thing to do that some or other have nothing
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.560]   to do with truth and doctrine, and therefore it will matter very little if we just look
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.480]   over them very lightly and rush on to what we regard as the essential teaching. But that
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.760]   is a very profound error. I would argue that it is always untrue, and that if ever you
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.320]   are reading anything that is worth reading, it is worth our while to pay attention to
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.800]   what the author or the writer deemed to be necessary or important, otherwise he would
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.360]   never have introduced it. He must have had some object in mind, or he wouldn't have said
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.560]   it all. But if that is true in general, it is of course particularly true with regard
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.280]   to these New Testament doctrines, these New Testament epistles, because invariably in
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.920]   these you will find, even in these preliminary salutations, truth which is vital and absolutely
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920]   essential.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.960]   Now, here in this first verse of this great epistle, we have a very great and glorious
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.880]   example of that very thing. It is of course the preliminary salutation, and yet you notice
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.240]   that the apostle can't even address these people at all, without at the same time presenting
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.440]   us with a very extraordinary description and definition of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.220]   Now that point I could put perhaps in another way by putting it like this, that so often
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.920]   people misinterpret the teaching of the New Testament scriptures because they will forget
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.840]   the people to whom the messages were addressed. Now that's of course particularly true with
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.280]   regard to the epistles. The teaching of the New Testament epistles is directed only and
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.760]   solely to Christians, to believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. It is utterly wrong, it
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.840]   is heretical, to take any New Testament epistle teaching and apply it to the world in general
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.440]   and the world at large. The teaching is addressed to particular people, and every time the writers
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   of the epistles make that, I say, perfectly plain and clear to us. And here the apostle
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.480]   leaves us in no doubt at all as to the people to whom he is writing. He addresses them immediately
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.840]   and he describes them as he does so. And what can be more important than for us to realize
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   exactly what he says at this point?
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.320]   Now let's be clear about another thing. The apostle here was writing what you may describe,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.680]   if you like, as a general letter. You notice that in the revised version it doesn't say
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.360]   to the saints which are at Ephesus. That part is left out, the Ephesus part is left out,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   which reminds us at once that in the ancient manuscripts there are some in which the words
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.600]   at Ephesus are not included. Actually it is the fact that the very oldest manuscripts
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.160]   of all don't contain the words at Ephesus. Other ancient manuscripts do have the words
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   at Ephesus. But the authorities are agreed in saying what must be perfectly plain and
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.040]   obvious that what really happened was this, that the apostle wrote a kind of circular
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.280]   letter to a number of churches, that he probably left a gap in which the name of the particular
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.520]   church to which a copy was sent could be inserted, so that it's a letter to the church at Ephesus,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   perhaps to the church at Colossae as well, and at other churches in that particular area.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.960]   And I take it that the tradition of describing this as particularly the letter to the Ephesians
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.000]   arose from the fact that the original copy, the original copy written by the apostle himself,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.040]   Oris Amenuensis, probably did go to the church at Ephesus itself. But now that is in a sense
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:26.200]   a quite immaterial point. The point I'm establishing is that this is a kind of general,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.080]   circular letter to members of churches. Or let me put it negatively. This is not a letter
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.880]   that was written to apostles only. It isn't a letter addressed to some unusual and exceptional
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.280]   Christian people. It isn't a letter addressed to some great scholars or theologians. It
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.000]   isn't a letter addressed to preachers and pastors. It isn't a letter addressed to
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.840]   people who, as the world puts it, have nothing else to do but to study the scriptures and
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.440]   to study religion and these things. It's not a letter to specialists at all. It is
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:14.360]   a letter to ordinary church members, to the most ordinary conceivable church members.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.680]   Now that is, I think, from every standpoint, a most important statement. It's important
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.080]   for this reason, that everything the apostle here says about Christians and about members
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:33.920]   of churches are therefore equally to be true of us. Not only that, all this high doctrine
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.840]   which we have in this epistle and to which we referred in passing in a general review
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.320]   last Sunday is something that you and I are meant to receive. The epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.760]   perhaps the crowning achievement of the apostle's life and all his writings, is an epistle that
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.520]   is addressed to people like ourselves. And ordinary members of the church, of all churches,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   are meant to take hold of these doctrines and to understand them and to rejoice in them.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.200]   They are not some abstruse study for certain special people. They are meant, I say, for
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.640]   us each and every one.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:19.880]   Now then, I am concerned this morning in particular, I say, with the description here given of
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.720]   the Christian. And I say it's a description not of some exceptional Christian, but of
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.960]   any Christian, of every Christian. In other words, we have here what we may well call
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.680]   the irreducible minimum of what constitutes a Christian.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.960]   Now in the body of this letter, the apostle, of course, is anxious that these people should
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:50.080]   learn more and learn deeper truths and higher truths. That's why he will go on to pray
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.320]   that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened, that they may know other things,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.760]   and that they may with all sense begin to apprehend what is the height and depth and
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.920]   length and breadth, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge. He's out
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:11.680]   for all that. But before he starts with all that, he reminds them of what they are already,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.240]   of what they know already, of what they have up to date.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.720]   So that this description of the Christian in this very first verse is a description
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.160]   of what those people at Ephesus already were. They would never have been members of the
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.440]   church at all, they would never have been the recipients of this letter, unless these
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:42.600]   things were true of them. And so, I say again, we find ourselves confronted here by what
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:51.560]   the New Testament teaches is the basic irreducible minimum of what constitutes a Christian.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   Now my friends, I'm calling attention to all this because, as I'm never tired of
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.080]   saying and of repeating, it seems to me that this is the primary need of the Christian
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:12.160]   church at the present hour, to realize exactly what it means to be a Christian. You see,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.440]   the early Christians, though they were but a handful of people, had that profound impact
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.480]   and influence upon that pagan world in which they found themselves. Why? Well, because
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.720]   they were what they were. It wasn't their organization, it was their quality of life.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.960]   It was the power they possessed, it was because they were truly Christian. That is how Christianity
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.560]   conquered the ancient world, and I am more and more convinced it is the only way in which
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.440]   Christianity can have such an influence in the modern world. The lack of influence of
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.520]   the Christian church upon the world at large today is, in my opinion, due to one thing
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:11:00.800]   only, and that is that all of us, God forgive us, are so unlike the description that we
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.280]   find in the New Testament of the Christian. And if, therefore, we are concerned about
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.840]   the state of the church, if we have a burden for the souls of men and women who are outside
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:18.400]   the church and in their misery and wretchedness, hurtling themselves to destruction, the first
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:24.720]   thing we have to do is to examine ourselves and to discover how closely we conform to
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.680]   this pattern and picture, and what we must do about ourselves if we find ourselves lacking.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.840]   Very well, then, let us look at this description this morning. The Apostle describes the Christian,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:44.520]   you notice, in three main terms. The first is "saints." Paul, an apostle of Jesus
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:52.600]   Christ by the will of God, to the saints. The saints at Ephesus, the saints at Laodicea,
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:59.960]   the saints in every other little church, however small, however large, the saints. The first
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.560]   thing to say about a Christian is that he is a saint. Doesn't that come rather strangely
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:15.280]   to us? Haven't we been rather going astray in our doctrine? Aren't we all rather prone
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.760]   to say, "Well, I am a Christian." Far from being a saint, you know. We are so afraid
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:28.040]   of making such a claim, we disavow this particular designation, afraid to say—and yet we are
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.320]   addressed as "saints." Well, what does he mean by calling them saints? What is a
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.920]   saint in this New Testament sense? Well, the first thing it always means is that we are
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.440]   people who are set apart. That is the meaning of the word that the apostle uses here, as
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   he uses it and other biblical writers use it. It means primarily "separated," set
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.560]   apart, called out. We have a perfect example of that very thing in that reading in the
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.200]   nineteenth chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, which we read together at the beginning. The
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.280]   apostle, when certain difficulties and opposition arose, he separated the disciples, we are
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.920]   told, and then began to meet with them in the school of that man, Tyrannus, daily. There
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.480]   he taught them and built them up and established them in the faith. He separated them, he took
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:29.240]   them apart. Now, that is the essential meaning of this word "saint." And a church, if
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.280]   you like, is a collection, a gathering of saints. The church is not an institution.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.920]   She is primarily a gathering, a meeting of saints. The perfect illustration, of course,
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:48.560]   is to say that the church now is similar to what the children of Israel were under the
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:56.360]   Old Testament dispensation. They were people who were set apart by God. They were taken
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.440]   out of the world, as it were. They were given a certain uniqueness by God. They were God's
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.840]   own people. You remember the words used, "He had a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.760]   and holy nation, a peculiar people, a people for God's peculiar possession and interest."
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.600]   Now, that is the definition of the children of Israel in the Old Testament. They were
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.360]   a nation, in a sense, amongst many other nations, and yet they were very different. They had
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.120]   certain laws which other nations didn't have. They had a certain word of God to them, a
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.800]   revelation that God had given to them. As Paul reminds the Romans in his epistle, they
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.080]   had the gift of the oracles of God, that unique gift. In other words, they were a separated
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:48.560]   people, set apart on their own, in the world and yet not of the world, standing out, set
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:56.720]   apart there for God and by God. Now, that is the meaning of this word "saint."
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:05.160]   So the Christian is a man who primarily is separated from the world. The apostles constantly
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.240]   saying this. You remember how he says exactly the same thing at the beginning of his letter
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.960]   to the Galatians. He says, "Grace to you and peace from God the Father and from our
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:21.040]   Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:27.080]   evil world according to the will of God and our Father." That's it. Deliver us out
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.840]   of the world. Separate us from the world. So that the Christian today, like the children
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.520]   of Israel of old, while he's in the world, is not of the world, he's a man like other
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:45.240]   men and yet he's very different. Now this is primary, this is basic. The Christian is
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:52.200]   not like anybody else. He's separated, he's apart. He's unique, he stands out. He's
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:16:02.480]   been called out by God. He's been separated from the world, separated to God. We can never
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:13.280]   emphasize that too frequently. Is this obvious about Christians today? The separation doesn't
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.960]   just consist in the fact that we go to a place of worship on Sunday morning, whereas most
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.400]   people don't. That's a part of it and a very important part of it. But it isn't
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.200]   the vital part of it. Because you see, that may be a mere matter of custom and of habit
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   or of social, part of the social round. The question is, are we truly separated as persons?
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.480]   Are we essentially different? Now then, let me put that by putting to you the second meaning
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.440]   of the word "saints." It not only means that we are set apart in an outward sense,
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.240]   it means that we are set apart because we are cleansed inwardly. And that is the meaning
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.360]   of the word "saint," of course, with which we are most familiar and to which we generally
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.880]   confine it. Instinctively, we think of a saint as some holy person, and we are right. But
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:11.360]   the first meaning must be put first. But there is this second meaning. A saint is someone
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.720]   who has been cleansed, and he's been cleansed in many ways. He's been cleansed from the
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:26.600]   guilt of his sin. He's been cleansed from that obvious evidence of sin, from that thing
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.560]   that excludes him from the presence of God. If I say to be a saint means that you're
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.080]   taken out of the world and that you're put into the presence of God and into the realm
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.600]   of God, well, isn't it clear that something must have happened which should have rendered
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:48.320]   us fit to come into the presence of God? And the thing that separates men from God is sin,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.400]   so that before anybody can be separated unto God, he or she must be cleansed from the guilt
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:58.960]   of sin. And that is the first truth about the Christian. He has been cleansed, as the
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.280]   apostle reminds us here in this very introduction, by the blood of Christ, in whom we have redemption
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.960]   through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. It's
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:18.560]   a vital, basic part of our whole position as Christians. But it doesn't stop at that.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.360]   The saint is one who has been cleansed also from the pollution of sin. It isn't a mere
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.280]   outward cleansing, it's an inward cleansing also. Because sin is something that affects
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:36.080]   the whole being, as we shall see later on in our study of this great epistle. But it
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:46.120]   does have this polluting effect. And the saint is one who has been cleansed from this pollution.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.240]   The thing that pollutes his mind and his heart, and therefore all his actions and everything
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   else, this cleansing process has taken place. He is cleansed outwardly, he is cleansed inwardly.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.240]   He has become what the Bible calls a holy person. You remember the mountain on which
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.320]   God gave the law to Moses? It's called the holy mount. Separated from that, the instruments
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.960]   in the temple, the vessels and so on, were called the holy vessels. They'd been cleansed
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.920]   and they were set apart and they were used for nothing else. They were holy unto the
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:29.120]   Lord. And that is what is meant by a saint. A saint is someone who has been cleansed and
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   set apart and is holy unto the Lord. Well, there it is again in that word that the apostle
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.560]   Peter applies to the Christian which was originally given to the children of Israel. "Ye are
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:47.960]   a holy nation, a peculiar people." That's it. A royal priesthood, etc. A people for
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:54.320]   God's peculiar position. Well, I haven't time to stay with these definitions for any
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:01.280]   length of time this morning. I'm much more concerned to make these two practical comments.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:09.040]   The first is, my friends, that these remarks apply to every Christian. To the saints which
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:18.080]   are at Ephesus, not simply to some of you, but to all of you, all the saints, to all
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:25.760]   the saints and all the faithful everywhere. Oh, I say we must learn to shed once and forever
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.960]   that false dichotomy which Roman Catholicism and its thinking and its teaching have introduced
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:38.320]   at this point. They canonize certain people, as they say, and call them saints. It's
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:44.180]   utterly unscriptural. It's all right if you like to pay tribute to a man who's outstanding,
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.840]   but that isn't what they do. They call these people saints only, and nobody else is a saint
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:55.120]   apparently. But that's thoroughly wrong. Every Christian is a saint. You can't be
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:21:03.000]   a Christian without being a saint. You can't be a saint, I say, and a Christian without
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.160]   being separated in some radical sense from the world. You don't belong to it any longer.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.840]   You're in it, but you're not of it. There's a separation which is taking place in your
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.200]   mind, in your outlook, in your heart, in your conversation, in your behavior. You are essentially
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.120]   a different person. The Christian is not a worldly person. He isn't governed by the
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:34.840]   world and its mind and its outlook. He's a saint. And it should be true of every single
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:43.520]   one of us. Oh, I cannot but repeat again my question. Isn't this the cause of the trouble,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:50.480]   my friends? That the masses of men and women living round and about us, many of them unhappy
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.840]   and desperate about themselves and their lives, they don't come to speak to us, they don't
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.200]   come to ask us questions, they don't fly to us in their trouble. Why? Well, because
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.640]   they don't feel that we are any different from them. There is not that about us which
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.840]   suggests that we are essentially different, and that therefore they can come to us and
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.040]   bring their burdens to us. We've got this false idea that only certain Christians are
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.000]   saints, and we haven't realized that every Christian is meant to be like this. My other
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:33.360]   comment is, the saints which are at Ephesus, or at Laodicea, or wherever else you like,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.880]   isn't this the point at which we see the whole marvel and the miracle of the Christian faith
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:47.080]   and Christian redemption? Do you remember the sort of city Ephesus was? Go back and
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.400]   read the entire 19th chapter of the book of Acts of the Apostles, and you'll get a very
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.960]   distinct impression of the city. It was a great city and a prosperous city, yes, but
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.520]   a thoroughly pagan city. They worshipped a goddess called Diana, and they cried saying,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:07.080]   "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" They were proud of themselves, proud of their goddess.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.240]   They felt that she'd blessed them and had made them what she was. They had this great
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:20.280]   civic pride, a proud, boastful city, but thoroughly pagan. Not only that, there was a great practice
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:26.320]   of sorcery and magic and things of that kind. Now I'm emphasizing all this for our encouragement
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:34.360]   in this way. Just conceive what happened. This apostle Paul visits the city, and all
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:41.720]   he found there was just twelve people, twelve men who were disciples of John the Baptist,
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.600]   who were very uncertain and unclear in their minds as to the truth. In fact, they didn't
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   really understand it in a Christian sense at all. Can you imagine anything more hopeless?
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:56.240]   This little man walks into that great city, and there it is, everything against him, pagan,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.960]   well organized, arrogant and proud of its paganism, and full of all these cults and
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:07.400]   mystic religions and everything that is opposed to God. You might ask the question, "What
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.560]   hope does he stand? What can ever happen in such a place?" But it's there this thing
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.280]   did happen. He preached, he was used of the Spirit, and the Church was established, these
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.560]   saints came into being. And it became the seat of the labors of the great and mighty
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:33.800]   apostle John, later on in that first century. We need to remind ourselves of this also.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:40.040]   The Gospel isn't a human teaching. It is the power of God unto salvation to every one
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.160]   that believeth. And when it enters the city, as it did in the person of the apostle Paul,
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:51.920]   filled with the Holy Spirit, there is nothing impossible to it. There is no one beyond redemption.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.320]   His very words at the beginning tell us that. You can't imagine a more hopeless place,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.880]   more hopeless people, but when the Gospel with this power comes in, these men are subdued
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.680]   and are converted.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.920]   Am I speaking, I wonder, to some Christian person who is beginning to feel rather hopeless
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.480]   about some loved one, a husband or a wife or a child or some dear relative? Do you feel
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.960]   that because of their intellectualism, or because of their training, or because of their
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.400]   surroundings, or because of anything, that the task is rather hopeless and that it can't
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:36.720]   be done? Remember, I say, the saints at Ephesus, yes, at Corinth, Galatia, anywhere, it's
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:43.560]   the power of God. It did it then. It's still doing it. It can still do it. It can take
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:51.240]   the most hopeless individual and turn him into a saint. That is its primary function.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.560]   That is the thing for which God has sent it forth.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.640]   But let me hurry to the second term, which is the term "faithful". The Christian
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:08.760]   is a saint. He is also someone who is faithful. Now, what's the meaning of this term "faithful"?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.480]   In a sense, it's rather an unfortunate translation, because we tend to give not the primary meaning
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:21.560]   again to this term, but once more, the secondary meaning. Essentially, this word "faithful"
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:31.760]   means exercising faith. Now, let me give you a perfect analogy. Do you remember how Thomas,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:39.560]   the apostle, refused to believe the testimony of his fellow disciples when he came back
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.720]   to them after an absence and they told him that the Lord had appeared amongst them? Thomas
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.160]   said he wouldn't believe it until he saw the very mark of the nails and could put his
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.280]   finger into the wounds and into the imprints of the nails. And then, you remember, the
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.800]   Lord suddenly appeared and showed himself to Thomas and said, "Come, Thomas, put your
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.880]   finger there." And then Thomas fell at his feet and said, "My Lord and my God."
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.480]   And you remember how our Lord gently rebuked him and said something like this to him, "Blessed
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.360]   thou hast believed because thou hast seen. Blessed are they that have not seen and yet
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:23.960]   have believed." And then he adds this, and he said, "Be not faithless, but believing."
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.240]   Now the word translated there in John 20, 27 as "believing" is the very same word
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:37.800]   that is translated here as "faithful." Be not faithless, but then be faithful. Don't
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:44.600]   be empty of faith, be filled with faith. Be full of faith, exercise faith, be a believer.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   Now then, the apostle addresses these Christians at Ephesus as those who are believers. They
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:59.920]   exercise faith. They are Christians because they are believers. Now then, here again is
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:08.120]   something that is absolutely fundamental and primary and vital. You can't be a Christian
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:15.360]   unless you believe something. The thing that makes us Christian is that we believe certain
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.480]   things. Go back again to that 19th chapter of Acts, you see, and there it is. These people
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.320]   met together and probably they regarded themselves as Christians. We are told that Paul found
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.880]   certain disciples. But the apostle evidently was not happy about them, so he put his famous
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.760]   question to them, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?" And they said,
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.840]   "We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." And then Paul said unto
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.520]   them, "Unto what then were ye baptized?" And they said, "Unto the baptism of John."
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.120]   Then said Paul, "John verily baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying unto the people
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.560]   that they should believe on him which would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus."
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:06.040]   When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Now it's all
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.360]   plain, and yet how often is it forgotten and indeed even denied? What's a Christian?
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.800]   Well, a Christian is a nice man, a good man, a man who likes to be a member of a church.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.920]   He's a man who's vaguely interested in moral uplift and in idealism. Oh yes, certain men
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.360]   described as great and outstanding Christians at the present moment really believe in what
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:35.840]   they call reverence for life. But my dear friends, that isn't a Christian according
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:43.360]   to these definitions. A Christian is one who believes certain specific things, and the
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:53.760]   essence of his belief, of course, is in the person of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.000]   You are faithful, you are full of faith. Faith in whom? Faith in what? Faith in the Lord
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.160]   Jesus Christ. Full of faith which believes that Jesus of Nazareth was the only begotten
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:15.000]   Son of God. Faith in the incarnation. Believing that the eternal substance was made flesh
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.800]   and dwelt amongst us. That the eternal Son took unto him human nature. Belief in the
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:29.320]   virgin birth. Belief in the fact that he manifested that he was the Son of God by his miracles.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.200]   They believed that. Paul was even enabled to work special miracles in Ephesus as a proof
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.400]   of this. They believed these things. They didn't hold them lightly. They were life
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:47.720]   to them. They were everything to them. And they knew what they believed. But above all,
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:55.400]   belief in the fact that he came into this world to taste death for every man. Belief
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:02.040]   in the fact that it is by his blood that he saves us. That it is by his shed blood where
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.680]   he bore the punishment of our sins and died our death that we are reconciled to God in
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:14.480]   whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins. They believed
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.840]   that. They were full of faith in these things. Belief in the fact that he had risen again
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.160]   from the dead. Not doubtfully or uncertain about that. Not some vague belief that Jesus
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.880]   still persists, but that in the body he rose out of the grave and manifested himself. And
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:38.360]   last of all to this man, Paul, on the road to Damascus. They were full of faith in that.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.000]   And belief in the person of the Holy Spirit. And that the Holy Spirit had been sent on
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.840]   the day of Pentecost, that the promise of the Father had come, and that he could be
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:55.080]   received thus, and that men knew when they had received him. They were full of faith
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:03.640]   in this. Are we faithful? You see, the vital question is not are we members of churches,
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.960]   but are we full of faith in these things? Do we know in whom we have believed? Do we
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.920]   know our own doctrine? Do we understand the way of salvation as it is expounded in the
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.400]   scriptures? We should be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in us,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.280]   says Peter, confirming Paul. But there is a second meaning to faithful, and it is this,
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:32.160]   the one we generally give to it. It means that we keep the faith, that we hold to the
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:38.200]   faith, that we are consistent in the faith, and loyal to the faith, and ready with Paul
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.960]   and the Philippians to defend the faith, and to contend earnestly for the faith, and to
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:53.120]   stand for the defense of the faith we can be relied upon. Faithful, yes, dependable
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.600]   and reliable because we know the faith, and because we believe it, and because we trust
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:07.080]   to it. But let us then remember this secondary meaning. We must be such people that we can
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.360]   be relied upon and depended upon. We must not be people who are carried about by every
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.920]   wind of doctrine, whose faith can be shaken because we may wake up tomorrow morning and
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.800]   read an article in a newspaper or a report of something that has been said by some great
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:27.240]   dignitary denying the miraculous and the virgin birth and things like that. No, no, we must
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:34.200]   be faithful, dependable, reliable. We know what we believe. We can contend for it. We
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.040]   can stand with the apostle as a solid rank and defend it against all adversaries, yes,
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:47.640]   and if persecution should come. We shan't flinch. These early Christians were told,
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   look here, if you persist in saying that Jesus is Lord, and if you refuse to say that Caesar
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:34:00.800]   is Lord, you shall be put to death. They still said Jesus is Lord. And you and I are tried
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.920]   and tempted, not perhaps in that open way. There are Christians in other parts of the
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:11.840]   world today who have to face even that. They have to face the possibility of losing their
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   work or employment or their professional interest. They may have to face being separated from
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.880]   their families, cast into prison, spat upon, yes, perhaps even shot or mutilated in some
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:31.240]   more terrible way, simply because of their loyalty to this. But they're standing, they're
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.320]   faithful, they know the truth, they're full of faith, and they can be depended upon and
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:43.760]   relied upon to stand to the last moment and never waver or vary, and gladly lay down their
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:52.120]   lives for it. Faithful. But you and I, I say, at the present, at any rate, don't have to
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:35:00.400]   face that. But we do have to face the raised eyebrows when we enter into certain companies
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:09.720]   and societies, or the snigger or the jeer as the Christian enters, the one who's had
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:16.720]   this religious complex or who's gone soft suddenly. Ah, the subtle, cruel persecution
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.640]   of the spirit. My friends, you and I are to be faithful. Whatever happens, however much
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.520]   the laughter and the mockery and the jeering, it doesn't matter at all. Whatever it may
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.920]   mean even financially, in a profession or in a business, what's it matter? Faithful,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:37.560]   reliable, dependable, standing on it, standing for it, at all costs, come what may. That's
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:46.280]   the Christian. He knows whom he has believed. And rather than deny him, he would sooner
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:53.240]   die. And lastly, this great phrase, "In Christ Jesus." Most important again that
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:57.600]   we should understand this and what it means. It isn't simply saying here that they're
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.000]   saints and those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. He means that, but this means much
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.960]   more than that. The term "In Christ Jesus" is connected with saints quite as much as
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:17.440]   faithful. They're saints in Christ Jesus. They're faithful in Christ Jesus. What's
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:22.840]   it mean? Well, I can only touch on it. God willing, we shall come back to this great
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.080]   phrase at some other time as we go through the epistle, because it's one of the great
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:31.560]   characteristic statements and phrases of the New Testament. What's it mean? It means
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:43.280]   this. The Christian is one who not only believes in Christ, he is in a real sense, in Christ.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:49.200]   I mean by that that he belongs to him, that he's united to him, that he is joined to
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:56.080]   him in this way. Take the New Testament illustrations. The illustration is the body. "Ye are the
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.600]   body of Christ," says Paul to the Corinthians, and members in particular. In the fourth chapter
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:08.040]   of this very epistle, he has the same analogy. He says that the church, the Christians, are
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.320]   all those who are built up like a body. He says, "But speaking the truth in love, that
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.800]   ye may grow up into him in all things, which is the head even Christ, from whom the whole
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:23.120]   body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.800]   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:35.760]   the edifying of itself in love." Now that's the picture. To be a Christian means not merely
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.440]   that you are a believer in Christ but outside him. No, no, you are a believer because you
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.120]   are joined to him, you are in him. Or let me put it in perhaps the clearest way of all,
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:51.000]   as we find it in the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. There, you remember,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.600]   Paul works out that great analogy and contrast. He says that we, all of us, were originally
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:05.200]   in Adam. Adam was not only Adam, he was in and of himself the representative of the entire
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:12.840]   human race. Everybody who has ever been born into this world was in Adam, part of Adam,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:19.600]   joined to Adam, so that Adam's action has had its consequences upon all. But you remember,
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:24.720]   he argues like this, that as we were all in Adam, so we are now, we are Christians, all
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:37.200]   in Christ. As in Adam, so in Christ. So the Christian is one who is in Christ. You see,
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:45.240]   it means this, that all that the Lord Jesus Christ has done becomes true of us. Again
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:50.560]   in the sixth of Romans, Paul works it out, when Christ, he says, was crucified, we were
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.920]   crucified with him. When he died, we died with him. When he was buried, we were buried
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.960]   with him. When he rose again, we rose with him. He is seated in the heavenly places,
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:08.720]   and Paul says in the second chapter of this Ephesian epistle, these words, and hath raised
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:17.520]   us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ. We are seated in
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:24.240]   the heavenly places with Christ at this moment, why? Well, because we are in Christ. What
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:31.400]   a tremendous thing this is. It's staggering. It's overwhelming. I am a part of Christ.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.800]   I belong to him. I am a member of the body of Christ. I am not my own. I have been bought.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.560]   I have been purchased, and there I am. I am in Christ. He is the head. I am one of the
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:53.120]   members, and there is this vital, organic, mystical union between us. All blessings that
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:02.240]   we ever enjoy as Christians come to us because we are in Christ. Of his fullness is done
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:08.840]   of all we received, and grace upon grace. I am the true vine, says the Lord himself,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.760]   and ye are the branches. My friend, that's true of you if you are a Christian. Don't
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:18.200]   talk to me about your weakness, about your helplessness. There is the life, and you are
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:25.200]   joined to the life. You are a part of the life. You are a branch in the vine, in Christ.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:33.080]   Oh, we'll come back to this, but let's take hold of it in principle this morning,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:40.680]   and let's meditate upon it. Let me help you to do so by ending with two brief comments.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.640]   Why do you think it is the apostle in describing the Christian here put these three things
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:52.320]   in the order in which he put them? Saints, faithful, in Christ. Why do you think he chose
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:41:00.040]   that order? I think the answer is very simple. The first and the most obvious thing about
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:08.480]   the Christian always ought to be the fact that he is a saint. You see, the apostle was
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:16.120]   looking in his mind's eye at the city of Ephesus, and there he saw something like this.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:24.160]   He saw a kind of oasis in a desert. A desert of paganism, sorcery, lawlessness, and all
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:31.080]   the rest of it. But standing in the midst of the desert, a green oasis. It stood out.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:38.440]   What's this? The church, the saints. It's the first impression you get, something different.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:46.760]   That's a very good way of looking at the Christian. The moment anybody looks at the
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:54.440]   world, he should at once be impressed by this fact that there are certain people in it who
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   stand out and are quite different, because they're saints. It's the first impression.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.680]   Everybody should know that we are Christians. All our neighbours, all our friends, all our
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.720]   colleagues, fellow workers. It should be obvious, it should be evident, it should stand out
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:17.960]   like that, because we are what we are, because of these things that are true of us. I say
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:24.800]   it is the greatest thing of all, and it should be the thing that should impress all. Something
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.560]   about us. We read of our blessed Lord that he could not be hid. You and I should be like
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.800]   that. It should be impossible for us to conceal the fact. It doesn't mean that I stand and
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.480]   proclaim and want my Christianity and I'm an angular, awkward person. No, no. It's
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.520]   a quality of saintliness. Something full of grace and of charm. Something like the Lord
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.040]   himself. It should stand out. Saints, first of all. Separate people. Different people,
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:59.120]   because we're holy people. And then the last comment is this. The vital importance of keeping
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:05.800]   this relationship ever. The relationship between being a saint and being faithful. The relationship
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:11.960]   between being holy and being a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. These things should
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:20.000]   never be separated. However much we may delude ourselves, there is no such thing as a theoretical
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.200]   Christian. There is no such thing as an academic Christian. Ah, yes, it's possible to hold
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.040]   the doctrines of the faith intellectually. You can give an intellectual assent to all
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.560]   these things, but that does not make us Christians. And that's why Paul put saints before faithful.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.640]   Let me read to you some words once uttered by John Calvin to emphasize this point. He
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   said, "No one is a believer who is not holy, and no one is holy who is not a believer."
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:55.240]   That's it. "No one is a believer who is not holy, and no one is holy who is not a
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:02.720]   believer." These two things must never be separated, I say. You must never put a gulf
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.200]   between justification and sanctification. If you're a Christian, you're in Christ,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.360]   and in Christ what happens? It's this. He's made unto you wisdom and righteousness and
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.960]   sanctification and redemption. You cannot, you must not, divide Christ. It's a pernicious
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.720]   doctrine which says that you can be justified alone without being sanctified. You can't.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.760]   You're a saint before you're faithful. You've been separated. That's why you believe.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.960]   These things are indissolubly linked, and God forbid that we should ever separate them
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:45.680]   or divide them. Holiness is something that is true of every Christian. And I say again
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:55.280]   in these words, if we're not holy, there is no point in what belief we claim to have.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:02.520]   You cannot be a believer without being holy. And you cannot be holy in this New Testament
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:13.560]   sense without being a believer. What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. Amen.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:20.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All
