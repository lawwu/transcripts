[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.200]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.480]   the show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.280]   with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.440]   and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.800]   and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.840]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.560]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   Today's episode of the show is going
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   to be quite a challenging one.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.840]   I had not intended to record a show this week at all.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.320]   I've been working on delivering the beta version
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.560]   of the career and income guide
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.840]   that I'm working my way through.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.080]   And I've been entirely focused on that
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   and some of my end of the year plans.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   And so after episode 500, I was planning to take a break,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.120]   but I feel I must record this show today.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.680]   And so I'm doing it, but it's gonna be a difficult one
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.840]   and a very challenging one.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.040]   Basically, my goal today is to share with you
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   some thoughts and ideas about how to protect yourself
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.840]   and to protect your career from being,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.960]   your entire financial life from being destroyed
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.920]   because of allegations of sexual misconduct,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   sexual scandal, sexual sin.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.000]   That is my goal.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320]   Now, two quick upfront warnings as I begin today's show.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.120]   Number one, most of Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.240]   is consumable by the entire family.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   Today's episode is obviously related
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.480]   to adult topics and adult themes.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.520]   So I would consider a show like this mandatory listening
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   for any person of perhaps double digit age and older,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.320]   but below double digits,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.200]   this may be one that you should screen first
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.480]   and consider carefully whether or not
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.160]   this will be helpful to your children.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.480]   So if you're accustomed to living
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.000]   or listening to the show with your children,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.360]   I recommend that you skip to a different show
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.040]   and enjoy that one today
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.600]   and then screen this one privately.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   Number two, if you are one who prefers your discussion
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.280]   of financial matters to be completely sanitized
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.200]   of religion, references to God and scripture,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.260]   any reading of any kind from the Bible,
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.400]   this will be a show that you will want to skip
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   and move on to a different show
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.060]   because there is no possible way
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.800]   to accurately deal with matters of sexual conduct
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.580]   without recognizing the source of moral law.
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.600]   So if you are in one of those two audiences,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.560]   I'll pause for a moment so you can leave
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.280]   and we'll continue with the adults in the room.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.320]   I guess a third comment would be that in my mind,
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   I frankly don't often know how to speak to these things
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.080]   in a mixed audience of men and women.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.200]   So for today's audience, my concern is men,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.840]   not so much women.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.560]   I'll allow someone else who feels the grace
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.120]   to speak to an audience of women about these issues.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.920]   I am not capable of that.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.800]   So for today, I know that the main audience
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.240]   of Radical Personal Finance is primarily male
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.960]   and I do feel qualified to speak to men.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.680]   I don't feel qualified to speak to women.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.360]   So if you're listening in,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.080]   just know that you're listening in
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.880]   and for the purpose of today's show,
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.000]   I can't accurately deal with these things
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.960]   in a mixed sex company.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.720]   So feel free to listen in,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.400]   but just recognize that from here forward,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.680]   I'm intentionally speaking to men.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.240]   Probably the first episode in 500 in which I have done that,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.260]   but in today's episode, I believe I must.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.240]   I did not intend, as I said, I think I said,
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.200]   I didn't intend to record a show today.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.280]   I've been focusing on other projects, but I feel I must.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.800]   And let me explain a little bit why.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.040]   No doubt over the last few weeks,
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   you have observed that
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.840]   people are crumbling,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.600]   that careers have been crumbling,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   and it seems to be a tsunami
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.280]   of new allegations every day,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   of sexual misconduct, sexual abuse,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.360]   just new allegations every single day.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   I saw a tweet as I'm recording this,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   it's Friday afternoon, November 10, 2017 at 3.17 PM.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.520]   How's that for a timestamp?
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.600]   And I noticed a tweet yesterday
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.720]   from the front page editor of the Huffington Post
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   who said that nine of the front page stories
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.400]   were with regard to explosive allegations
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.640]   of sexual misconduct towards well-known people.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.040]   And in fact, they had 10 stories,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.360]   but they had to bump one of those stories
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.160]   off of the front page
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.200]   because there were others of a bigger one.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   And what's been fascinating to me
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.560]   has been to watch these things develop
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.920]   in the media context.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.640]   And I have watched this now, of course,
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.000]   with you, I'm sure, for the last,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.320]   I don't know, has it been a week, month, a month or so?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   Been watching these things happening.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.480]   And amazingly, there's been tremendous
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.320]   financial repercussions for the people
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.000]   who are experiencing these allegations
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.320]   and who are being,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   or is being alleged that they've
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.480]   engaged in sexual misconduct.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.400]   And so there's been tremendous financial hardship.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.800]   So of course, me being the host of "Rumor, the Daily,"
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.880]   I'm the host of "Radical Personal Finance,"
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.160]   I watch these things and I notice and I say,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.680]   "Oh, I could do a show about that."
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.080]   And I've stayed away from it.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.320]   I've really stayed away from it.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.280]   And I've thought about the show.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   I've built the whole thing in my head,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.080]   but I haven't wanted to do it.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.320]   And the reason I haven't wanted to do it
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.960]   is because most of the people who have been exposed,
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.720]   most of the people who are receiving allegations
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.240]   from people that they've allegedly abused
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.880]   have been people that I just don't have much in common with.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.200]   I don't have any significant scenario.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.160]   And I have often felt like it would be wrong for me to come
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.920]   and if it's just somebody like Harvey Weinstein,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.360]   a very liberal person involved in an industry
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.920]   that I don't think much of,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.320]   that it would be wrong for me to just come
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.960]   and use him as an example.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.220]   The Bible teaches in the book of Proverbs,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.500]   it says, "Do not rejoice," where is it?
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.560]   "Do not rejoice when your enemy falls.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.120]   Let not your heart be glad when he stumbles.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.840]   Lest the Lord see it and be displeased
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.440]   and turn away his anger from him."
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.520]   So I think it's very important.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.520]   And I always try to make sure,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.120]   I don't wanna be rejoicing when my enemy falls.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   I don't wanna let my heart be glad when somebody stumbles.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.800]   And I'm deeply concerned with our current conversation
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.400]   because it seems as though that's the first inclination,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.360]   or at least when you do a survey
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.400]   of the way people speak publicly in their Twitter feeds
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.760]   or in their Facebook feeds,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.080]   it's almost like we rejoice when our political enemies fall.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.000]   And I think this is such a destructive,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.280]   it's just such a destructive standard.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.360]   And I don't wanna be participating in it.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.200]   I really don't.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.720]   And so as these people have come out
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.120]   and these allegations have come out,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.180]   I just felt like it would be in poor taste
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.280]   and wrong of me to attach it,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   to attack this subject.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   That is until yesterday
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.440]   when an explosive Washington Post article was published
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.320]   with allegations of sexual misconduct
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.400]   on behalf of Judge Roy Moore,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.640]   a man who is running for Senate in the state of Alabama,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.320]   a man who is widely touted as a Christian,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.840]   a man who has been very vocal
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.000]   in his defense of his interpretation
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.620]   of biblical Christianity,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.960]   specifically on moral issues.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.440]   That has been a hallmark of his career.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.680]   He was a judge in the state of Alabama,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.580]   twice thrown out of office under ethics obligations
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.440]   because he stood up for what he believed
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.040]   is a moral situation,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.660]   just a firebrand of a figure,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.160]   and then an absolutely explosive article yesterday.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.440]   And so I felt like one of the things
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.620]   that's very important to me is
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.780]   we should deal with the things that are near us.
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.840]   We should be the ones who deal with the sin
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.200]   that is in our circles.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.800]   We have no right to go across town, as an example.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.840]   We have no right to go across town
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.280]   and try to point out all of the problems in somebody else
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.640]   until we've dealt with the problems
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.060]   that are in our own life, in our own families,
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.940]   in our own local church, in our own community,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.320]   in our own city.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.560]   And I build this on Jesus' teaching.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.360]   He said, "Don't go and point out the speck
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.840]   "in your neighbor's eye until you deal with the log
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.100]   "that's in your own eye."
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.580]   The idea is we can all see things
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.880]   that are wrong with other people,
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.680]   but let's not be those who just start
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.420]   with things that are over there.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.020]   And so it was on that basis that I said,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.060]   "You know what, I think that we should always be the first
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.460]   "to deal with the community that's near us."
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.780]   I've tried to approach it in this way.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.940]   If I'm a financial advisor,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.780]   I need to be the one who's dealing with the misconduct
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.600]   in the community of financial advice
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.360]   and bringing justice to that community
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.860]   to the extent that I can.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.420]   It's not my job to go and solve Hollywood.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.060]   I don't have any contact with Hollywood,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.740]   but I need to deal with what's in
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.540]   the financial advice industry,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.920]   or I need to deal with what's near at hand.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.160]   And I think often, so often, we miss this,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.180]   and it leads to just our aimlessly
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.100]   whacking about with our ideas,
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.700]   constantly just trying to find fault in other people.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.720]   Yes, it's good to see those things.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.860]   That's fine, but let's spend some time,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.560]   let's not be so blind to the problems that are near us.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   And so if I expect the Hollywood community
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.380]   to deal with Harvey Weinstein,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.660]   then I should be one to stand up and not be silent
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.860]   when there are allegations against somebody
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.380]   like Judge Roy Moore.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.380]   I have a responsibility to speak clearly to the subject.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.420]   Now, my concern is I don't know if, frankly,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.140]   any of these people are guilty.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.660]   I don't know if Judge Roy Moore is guilty
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.120]   of what is alleged against him.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.940]   I don't know if Harvey Weinstein is guilty
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.560]   of what's alleged against him.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.700]   I don't know if Bill O'Reilly is guilty
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.920]   of what's alleged against him.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.960]   I don't know if Kevin Spacey is guilty
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.040]   of what's alleged against him.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.900]   How would I know?
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.840]   How could I possibly know?
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.380]   All I know is what's reported.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.260]   Unfortunately, I've lost significant confidence
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.340]   over the last five years
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.540]   in the way that things are reported.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.580]   And I can judge based upon what's reported,
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.200]   and I can think, is this accurate?
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.040]   Is this thoughtful?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.880]   Is this accurate?
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.020]   But I don't actually know what's happened.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.160]   And I believe that one of the things we should do
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   is continue our practice of believing
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.300]   that people are innocent until they're proven guilty.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.740]   So I don't know if Moore or any of these people are guilty.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.100]   It's impossible for me to discern.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.940]   But I do want to see justice brought.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.700]   And if they are guilty, I want to see justice brought.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.860]   And if they're innocent, I want to see justice brought.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.320]   And this is very challenging,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.360]   because we need to make sure that we listen carefully
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.260]   to the victims of crimes and the victims of immorality.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.100]   Unfortunately, I think most of us,
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.980]   we've been guilty in the past
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.220]   of not listening carefully to victims.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.360]   When somebody says, "I've been victimized,"
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.700]   we should stop everything and listen very, very carefully.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.620]   But I don't think we should believe every victim's story.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.820]   We should look for evidence, and we should look for proof,
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.300]   and we should be open.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.660]   And if there is guilt,
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.380]   we must follow through consistently with that guilt.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.180]   Bible says in Proverbs 18,
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.380]   "The one who states his case first seems right
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.860]   until the other one comes and examines him."
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.740]   And so one of the things that's important
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.740]   is for us to hear fully facts and not jump to conclusions.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.860]   We should hear fully facts, we should hear fully evidence,
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.060]   and then we should allow those
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.920]   who are close enough to the situation
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.000]   to seek to bring justice.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.020]   No matter the cost, justice must be brought.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.820]   Criminals, no matter whether we like them,
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.180]   whether we don't, I like Judge Moore.
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.300]   Doesn't matter.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.060]   If he's guilty of that, I'll be the first,
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.580]   and I should be the first.
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.100]   I'll be the first to stand up and condemn
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.160]   and say justice needs to be brought.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.480]   But we should also be careful.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.660]   We wanna make sure that we have
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.620]   multiple witnesses of something.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.460]   We wanna make sure that there's good evidence,
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.720]   and we wanna make sure that we don't just jump in
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.660]   with what's politically expedient,
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.680]   that we don't defend somebody without hearing facts,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.620]   nor that we automatically come against somebody
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.620]   without hearing facts.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.180]   And I fear so much for the coming decades
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.180]   because we're separating into these tribal groupings,
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.340]   and things that we would find utterly abhorrent
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.020]   if our political opponent did it,
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.380]   we jump to it when it gives us a place for power,
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.100]   and vice versa, and I think we're all guilty of that.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.500]   And I don't wanna do that.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.740]   The Bible teaches in the book of Exodus,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.820]   it says you shall not fall in with the many to do evil.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.540]   Do not fall in with the many to evil,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.420]   nor shall you bear witness in a lawsuit.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.980]   Siding with the many so as to pervert justice.
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.900]   Even if you're one person standing against thousands,
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.920]   stand for what's right, no matter the cost.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.260]   So, that's my heart to start with,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.460]   is I wanna see justice brought,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.220]   and I wanna see righteousness done,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.220]   and the victims, restitution brought to victims
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.660]   if there are victims,
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.580]   but also I don't wanna see justice perverted
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.900]   for political expediency,
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.220]   and I think that's the danger that we face.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.340]   So, let's be the first to check ourselves.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.940]   And so, I ask you, if you are a conservative person,
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.220]   let's use this, I hate these words,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.500]   conservative and liberal,
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.400]   but they're effective enough for now.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.300]   If you're a conservative person,
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.060]   if you're on the political right,
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.300]   did you celebrate when Harvey Weinstein,
[00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.300]   a leading Democrat donor, and behind the scenes guy,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.500]   on the left was found out and exposed,
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.420]   and these allegations come against him publicly,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.580]   did you rejoice, did you celebrate?
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.120]   And if you're on the left,
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.320]   and have a tendency towards a liberal perspective,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   did you celebrate when you heard that Judge Roy Moore,
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.400]   an open, loud mouth bigot, according to some,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.100]   was accused of assault?
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.160]   Did you celebrate when you said,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.720]   "Ha ha, we finally got him?"
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.320]   I hope you didn't.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.040]   In fact, if you're listening to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.480]   I bet you didn't.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.680]   I don't know how you could listen to this show
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.440]   and celebrate, but I know a whole lot of people did,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.520]   and we need to be those who don't do that.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.680]   We need to be those who seek for justice and for truth,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.980]   no matter the cost, justice and truth,
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.200]   but not celebrate, don't rejoice when your enemy falls,
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.700]   and don't let your heart be glad when he stumbles.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.740]   Now, that's a bit of preamble,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.700]   and I didn't know any other way to start the show,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.780]   but my major focus in today's show
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.820]   is just to talk about you and me,
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.620]   to talk about how you can protect yourself.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.160]   And I guess I should, well,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.300]   just to talk about how you can protect yourself.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.260]   For the sake of clarity, here is my position, my worldview,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.160]   and I'll state it very, very clearly.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.620]   Sexual contact of any kind,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   between any people except one husband and one wife is wrong.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.580]   That's the position that I hold.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.380]   Sexual contact between any people
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.280]   except one husband and one wife is wrong.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.740]   That's it.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.820]   That is my entire outlook on human sexuality
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.920]   and what's appropriate.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.220]   Now, I'll talk briefly at the end
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.660]   just about the very confusing situation that we face,
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.260]   but my hope is to help you avoid, excuse me,
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.020]   the confusing situation that we face in our modern era
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.940]   with very strange public sexual ethics.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.340]   This is what is so strange to me about Hollywood.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.860]   Seems like, I don't know, I don't watch many movies,
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.580]   I'm not that involved in that world.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.660]   I watch it from a peripheral perspective
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.780]   and read the newspaper articles about it,
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.380]   but I'm not involved in Hollywood.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.060]   But it sure seems to me like anything goes in Hollywood,
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.380]   or at least based upon what's recounted to me
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.460]   of modern popular Hollywood culture,
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.780]   it seems as though you can do just about anything,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.540]   you can depict just about anything.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.820]   And it seems like it's, whether it's in Hollywood movies
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.140]   or whether it's on HBO, I mean,
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.280]   from what I'm told, "Game of Thrones"
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:11.180]   is one of the most abusive, sexually charged
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.460]   and abusive shows on television.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.360]   And yet it also seems to be one of the most popular shows.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.920]   I don't know how an industry that puts out that
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.660]   as a product, selling that as attractive.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.600]   From my understanding, it's not,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.080]   when abuse, especially sexual abuse is pictured,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.000]   it's not pictured as something that's abhorrent,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   which it should be.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.480]   Should be, if there's going to be something
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.920]   that is questionable, it should be pictured
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.640]   as the evil that it is.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.040]   And the art of the movie should come against it
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.160]   so powerfully that you walk away from it
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.040]   with a clear moral understanding, not an ambiguity.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   There should be no ambiguity whatsoever.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.000]   And I'm constantly, I'm amazed at how this industry
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.080]   is stands up and is opposing all of these,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.480]   words fail me, 'cause very strong ones come to mind,
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.480]   all of these people who are alleged of sexual abuse.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.100]   I'm constantly, I'm amazed at that.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.720]   It's just incredible.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.200]   It proves out what the Bible says
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.520]   when it says in the book of Numbers,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.680]   "Be sure your sins will find you out."
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.520]   And I don't know, I'm just amazed at how an industry
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.180]   that glorifies sexuality of every form
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.720]   and of every type with seemingly no limit.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.080]   In Hollywood films, there's no limit,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.200]   no limit whatsoever to what is glorified.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.740]   And yet that's the industry that has been using
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.160]   to be blown wide open.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.680]   And I'm so thankful for it.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.160]   I don't care who brings justice or righteousness.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.640]   I don't care who brings it or how it comes.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.840]   I just want it to be brought.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.840]   Anyway, forgive me.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.280]   That's how I feel about it.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.320]   So my concern for you is how can you protect yourself?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.600]   What can you do?
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.080]   And I think this is very important
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   because the higher you go in your career,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.760]   the higher you go in your earnings,
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.480]   the higher you go in your place of prominence,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.600]   the greater the danger for you.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.540]   You know what, there are a whole lot of victims
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.460]   of a whole lot of abusers that would love
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.580]   to see their abuser exposed publicly,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.380]   but because the abuser is not important,
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.440]   they don't have any notoriety,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.260]   that abuser just goes on abusing.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.580]   And it ought not to be so.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.640]   That's your job and my job to be diligent where we are.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.540]   But if you rise to a place of prominence
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.900]   and there's a place of public notoriety,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.140]   then everything changes.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.220]   You say, well, Joshua, I'm not in a place of notoriety.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.740]   I'm not in a place of prominence.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.140]   Well, guess what?
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.280]   This is the time to be careful.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.300]   This is the time to be circumspect
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.100]   in your actions and your behavior.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.960]   This is the time to protect yourself.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.500]   This is the time to be careful.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.400]   As we see in the allegations against Judge Roy Moore,
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.600]   who knows, you may go on for 30 years.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.820]   All of a sudden, allegations from 30 or 40 years prior
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.780]   come up.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.380]   You better make sure that doesn't happen to you.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.060]   Now, I want to give you some suggestions.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.340]   Some of these will be big picture
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.360]   and some of them will be very specific and tactical.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   Perhaps the biggest thing that you should consider
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.940]   is if you have the opportunity, you should marry
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.380]   and you should marry early.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.260]   One of my biggest concerns about our current society,
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.540]   and this is true in every aspect of society,
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.580]   broader, secular society, it's very true
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.740]   within the kind of the modern evangelical Christian society,
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.260]   we've done ourselves a great disservice
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.780]   by allowing marriage to be painted and set up
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.980]   as a form of bondage rather than as a form of joy
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.160]   and something tremendous and wonderful.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.780]   I've been wanting to do an episode for a while
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.600]   and I just felt like it was too important
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.780]   for me to do lightly and so I need to be very prepared for it.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.540]   We want to do a series on marriage and money.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.580]   I've had requests for it and it's so important
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.580]   because if you were gonna say, you know,
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.240]   the number one thing that you can do to get wealthy
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.180]   is frankly get married.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.860]   The data on this, the sociological data on this subject
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.140]   is so crystal clear that marriage
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.860]   on every single metric of success,
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.220]   no matter how you look at it,
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.040]   whether it's purely financial, income-wise, wealth-wise,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.580]   whether it's with regard to your children,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.600]   on every single metric of success,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.620]   marriage is the key.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.140]   I call it the success sequence, right?
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.700]   Marriage is the key and one of the books
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.080]   that I read in January this year
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.380]   that just really blew me over
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.060]   'cause it was ignorant of the data,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.020]   I read Charles Murray's book, "Coming Apart,
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.960]   "The State of White America, 1960 to 2010"
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.740]   and what was remarkable to me was the difference in classes.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.700]   I couldn't believe it how the lower class,
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:20.280]   people have this idea, there's this cultural perception,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.340]   if you follow modern culture,
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.640]   that among the upper class,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.420]   marriage is the thing that is not in style.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.060]   You can come and go very morally,
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.540]   anything is right, however you wanna live is appropriate.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.940]   You can just do this as you like
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.980]   but among the lower class,
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.740]   well, a bunch of usually religious zealots,
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.620]   they gotta stay married and people get married quick
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.980]   and get married at 16
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.460]   and start pumping out those children, right?
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.020]   There's this cultural idea about this,
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.900]   especially among the elite.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.740]   They have this idea,
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.500]   this very permissive attitude among the elite
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.460]   and those uneducated lower class,
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.440]   they just get married.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.260]   That's the exact opposite of the facts.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.120]   The facts are among the lower class in the United States,
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.580]   marriage has collapsed
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.180]   and has led to absolute poverty of all kinds
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.220]   and among the upper class,
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.940]   although the upper class preaches the most vociferously
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.620]   about the immateriality of marriage,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.220]   about how it's not all that important,
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.620]   it doesn't really make that big of a difference.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.820]   They marry at pretty much the historical rates
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.020]   and they experience great success.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.820]   Now, someday I'll deal with that one,
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.020]   I'll cite data,
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.520]   I feel like I should do that one
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.940]   with good support right now.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.660]   Go and research it if you disbelieve me
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.580]   but one of the best things you can do for your wealth
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.580]   is marry and frankly, marry early
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:54.300]   and one of the big reasons for marriage is sex.
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:59.160]   Sure, there's more to it than that
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   but one of the big reasons for marriage is sex.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:12.020]   Marriage is a gift from God to allow you to enjoy sex
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.520]   and one of the best ways
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.680]   if you're experiencing sexual attraction
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.280]   is get married so that you can enjoy sex morally,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.120]   uprightly with your spouse.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.940]   The Bible in 1 Corinthians chapter seven
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.260]   says this so crystal clear
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   and unfortunately, I'm ashamed, utterly ashamed
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.400]   of many modern Christian preachers
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.000]   who hem and haw about the fact that marriage is for sex
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.080]   and they sit back and play this prudish game
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.960]   or this thing where they just wanna go along
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.700]   with everyone else and not recognize just the value of sex.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.040]   Let me just read the Bible to you.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.460]   1 Corinthians chapter seven says this,
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.920]   now Paul is speaking to a Corinthian church.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.720]   For context, if you're not a Bible reader,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.160]   just a quick little bit of context.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.480]   There are two in the New Testament in the Christian Bible,
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.200]   there are two letters that are collected.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.360]   One is called 1 Corinthians
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.640]   and one is called 2 Corinthians.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   Now, some scholars believe
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.920]   that it's actually a total of four letters
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.100]   but they're listed in the Bible as two different letters
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.680]   and the Corinthian church is probably the example
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.440]   that we have in the Bible of the most dysfunctional,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.360]   utterly awful church.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.940]   I think most of us, at least me and many of you that I know,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.200]   you think about saying the words Corinthian church
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.560]   and you hardly wanna call them a church
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   because they're just so utterly dysfunctional and immoral.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.860]   The town, and it's natural and normal,
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.060]   the town of Corinth was, as I understand it,
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.660]   a seaside town filled with every bit of immorality
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.520]   that a seaside town is filled with.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.420]   And so the letter is written by a man named Paul
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.260]   who is one of the early Christian preachers
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.220]   and very influential.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.420]   It's many of his letters that make up the New Testament.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.540]   And so this letter is very, very practical
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.540]   and has a lot of careful, practical instruction
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.140]   about specific issues.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.300]   So read from 1 Corinthians chapter seven, Paul says this,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.740]   "Now concerning the matters about which you wrote,
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.120]   "it is good for a man not to have sexual relations
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.980]   "with a woman, but because of the temptation
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.820]   "to sexual immorality," and side note here,
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.940]   when the Bible uses the term sexual immorality,
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.220]   it refers to any kind of sexual activity
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.500]   outside of marriage relationship with a husband and wife.
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.060]   And there are a couple different words that are often used,
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.060]   the word fornication, sex before marriage,
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.340]   and the words adultery, sex with somebody who is married.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.400]   But sexual immorality is an inclusive term
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.140]   of any kind of sexual contact outside of,
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.180]   between a husband and a wife within the context of marriage.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.540]   "But because of the temptation to sexual immorality,
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.380]   "each man should have his own wife,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.420]   "and each woman her own husband.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.500]   "The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.880]   "and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.540]   "For the wife does not have authority over her own body,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.920]   "but the husband does.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.040]   "Likewise, the husband does not have authority
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.140]   "over his own body, but the wife does."
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.800]   And it says, "Do not deprive one another,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.160]   "except perhaps by agreement for a limited time
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.980]   "that you may devote yourselves to prayer,
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.800]   "but then come together again,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.640]   "so that Satan may not tempt you
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.360]   "because of your lack of self-control."
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.820]   So that's the scripture,
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.200]   and I'm gonna avoid some of the temptations
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.560]   to kind of preach and pull that whole passage of heart
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.900]   and show some of the important things.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.280]   That's for context for a different show
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.160]   or a different occasion.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.000]   But the basic message that I wanna emphasize here
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.320]   is that the basic purpose of marriage
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   is to avoid sexual immorality.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.680]   That's one of the basic things,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.000]   that a husband and a wife within marriage
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.840]   can enjoy all of the pleasure of marriage
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.800]   and thus avoid sexual immorality,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.520]   have a satisfying sexual relationship
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.440]   within the context of marriage.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.280]   That's the point.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.400]   That's one of the major benefits.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.880]   Now, it's not the only benefit,
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.280]   but it's definitely not an ancillary benefit.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.720]   It's definitely not a secondary benefit.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   And for Christians, there is nothing,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:15.920]   there's nothing, it's not more righteous to be celibate.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.320]   It's righteous to be married and to enjoy sex.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.080]   One of the things in Proverbs chapter five,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.560]   Solomon says, teaching to his son, he says this,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.720]   I'll just read it in the original language,
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   but it says, "Let your fountain be blessed
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.260]   "and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.300]   "a lovely deer, a graceful doe.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.780]   "Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.100]   "Be intoxicated always in her love."
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.980]   I haven't called my wife a deer in a while.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.920]   I should try that.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.900]   I should tell her she's a lovely doe and see what it says.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.580]   It's a little bit of cultural appropriateness
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.620]   to certain types of language.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.060]   But again, I'll just read it.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.300]   "Let your fountain be blessed
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.980]   "and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.380]   "a lovely deer, a graceful doe.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.580]   "Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.140]   "Be intoxicated always in her love.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.960]   "Why should you be intoxicated, my son,
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.220]   "with a forbidden woman
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.940]   "and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?"
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.800]   Now listen carefully.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.140]   "For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.320]   "and he ponders all his paths.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.220]   "The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.420]   "and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.260]   "He dies for lack of discipline
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.420]   "and because of his great folly he is led astray."
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.100]   I don't want you to die for lack of discipline
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.260]   and I don't wanna die for lack of discipline.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.220]   And it's very important
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.340]   that we put discipline around ourselves
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.340]   to protect ourselves from committing sexual immorality.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.300]   I was gonna say, and I forgot at the beginning,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.420]   but the way that you protect yourself from sexual scandal
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.820]   and the way that you protect your career
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.820]   from being torpedoed due to sexual scandal
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.540]   is don't engage in sexual scandal.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.660]   That's how you protect yourself.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.260]   Now, unfortunately, that's not enough anymore.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.140]   You have to avoid even the appearance of evil,
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.180]   as the King James Bible says in one translation
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.900]   from 1 Thessalonians 5.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.180]   So every other translation, I need to look this up,
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.500]   but abstain from every form of evil.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   But the King James Version says
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.340]   abstain from the appearance of evil.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.500]   So it's not enough just to not do bad things to people.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.340]   It's not enough just to not commit sexual sin,
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.040]   but you have to avoid even the appearance of it.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.260]   But it's a good starting place.
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.580]   And so you've gotta build around yourself
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.900]   walls of discipline so that you can stay faithful
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.420]   to your spouse.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.700]   Now, if you're not married, be very careful
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.580]   and listen to some of what I have to say.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.460]   And I'll talk in a moment about pornography
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.020]   and the temptations for those of you who are not married.
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.500]   But if you're not married, be careful.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.420]   Now, if you're also not married and you're courting,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.020]   court carefully, be careful.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.340]   Put walls and fences around yourself to protect yourself.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.940]   One thing my wife and I learned that we had to do
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.980]   during the time of our engagement,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.820]   we had to be very, very careful
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.900]   not to put ourselves into relationships
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.120]   where the passions of the flesh would lead to sin.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:34.060]   Once you start down that road, it is impossible to stop.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:39.060]   And your only point of defense is don't put yourself
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.960]   in a situation where you're not protected.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.780]   Be careful.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.840]   Chaperones are a good idea, and it shouldn't be foisted
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.540]   upon you by someone else.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.720]   It's something that you should put upon yourself
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.880]   to protect yourself.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.180]   Be careful what appetites you feed.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.140]   If you're gonna protect yourself from sexual scandal,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.240]   you have to avoid sexual sin.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.860]   If you're going to avoid sexual sin,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.940]   you have to be careful what appetites you feed.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.380]   If you feed the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh,
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.680]   your desire and your lust will grow.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.580]   So focus not on feeding the lust of the eyes
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.580]   and the lust of the flesh for other people.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.240]   Fill your appetite with your spouse.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.020]   Feed your appetite for a fulfilling sexual relationship
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.440]   with your wife and give yourself fully to her.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.040]   That takes work.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.120]   It is hard, but it's worth it.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   People often have this impression and this idea
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.160]   that erotic fulfillment is easy and it's natural,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.440]   and that's what's taught.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.520]   That's what's taught by Hollywood.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.520]   And these, I struggle so much, these cretins,
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:07.640]   these cretins are the ones who put forth
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.120]   the stuff that destroys people's lives,
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   and it obviously has the same corrosive effect
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.440]   on their own life.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.700]   And then they have the gall to say that somehow
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.400]   those of us who say, no, what you're doing is destructive
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.880]   because you're putting forth something
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.800]   that is destroying people's lives
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.960]   'cause you're lifting up lust and things that are evil
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.200]   and putting them as good and painting them with good levels.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.640]   Well, we're the prudes.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.120]   Uh-huh, that is a bunch of nonsense.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.320]   It's poppycock, it's stupid.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.380]   If you feed on the lust of those cretins in Hollywood,
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:48.640]   you're gonna wind up acting like those cretins in Hollywood.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.600]   So feed your appetite for a fulfilling sexual relationship
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.200]   with your wife and give yourself to her.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.740]   Cut off as many external sources of temptation as you can.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.440]   It's always hard 'cause you sound a little bit,
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.400]   what's the word?
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.900]   I don't know, overly zealous and whatnot,
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.860]   but I don't see how it is possible
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.360]   to consume much of modern entertainment
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.400]   and not feed those lusts.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.760]   I don't know, I guess a Game of Thrones earlier,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.240]   I don't know how it's, I hear, hey,
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.120]   lots of people like Game of Thrones,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.400]   but I'm sorry, I don't want to model
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.440]   what I hear is modeled in that life.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.320]   I don't wanna become an abusive adulterer,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.960]   so why would I parade that stuff before my eyes?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:38.200]   In the book of James,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:43.880]   James, for those of you who aren't big Bible readers,
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.900]   the book of James is another book
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.880]   that's collected in the New Testament.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   It's written by a man named James,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.480]   who is the half-brother of Jesus,
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.520]   the son of Mary and Joseph,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.320]   and so he's the half-brother of Jesus.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.160]   It's the only book that we have in the Bible,
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.880]   it's the only kind of record that we have
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.120]   of the brothers or even sisters,
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.920]   brothers and sisters of Jesus.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.960]   So book of James, half-brother of Jesus,
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.600]   and he was not one of the 12 disciples,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.440]   but he wrote this book,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   and it's actually my favorite book in the Bible,
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.620]   the one that I most enjoy.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.220]   But in the book of James, chapter one,
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.660]   James says this, "Let no one say when he is tempted,
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.140]   "I am being tempted by God,
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.560]   "for God cannot be tempted with evil,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.220]   "and He Himself tempts no one.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.740]   "But each person is tempted when he is lured
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.620]   "and enticed by his own desire.
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.380]   "Then desire, when it has conceived,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.220]   "gives birth to sin,
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.080]   "and sin, when it is fully grown,
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.600]   "brings forth death."
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.780]   Again, "Each person is tempted
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.340]   "when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.620]   "Then desire, when it has conceived,
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.960]   "gives birth to sin,
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.520]   "and sin, when it is fully grown,
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.020]   "brings forth death."
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.720]   There's nothing wrong with desire,
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.300]   but you've gotta make sure that you channel your desire
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.320]   in the right direction.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.820]   Channel it towards your wife.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.260]   Now, a little bit ago I said,
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.380]   that's not enough just to avoid evil.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.460]   And in today's world, I believe that firmly,
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.540]   and I think there is sufficient evidence on all sides
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.640]   to demonstrate as to why that is so important.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:42.020]   You've got to not only avoid evil,
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.740]   you've gotta avoid the appearance of evil,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.060]   and you've gotta make sure that you give no place
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.180]   that any accusation can come against you.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.740]   Now, you can't control if somebody accuses you,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:58.560]   but you can control if there's any evidence whatsoever
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.900]   that could be questionable.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:06.180]   My recommendation, don't allow yourself
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   to be alone in a private, concealed place
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.760]   with someone of the opposite sex
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.100]   to whom you're not married.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.100]   Don't allow yourself to be alone
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.860]   in a private, concealed place
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.460]   with someone of the opposite sex to whom you're not married,
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.540]   or I guess I should say,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.380]   who's not your mother or your sister.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.440]   Don't give place for it.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.740]   Now, I was amazed.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.220]   If you do this, and if you follow this,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.060]   you can generally do this without ever anyone knowing it.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:42.060]   And notice how carefully I qualified that.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.840]   There's a place where you need to make sure,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.280]   you're gonna be forced constantly to be in situations
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.560]   in which you're going to be together and alone
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.520]   with someone of the opposite sex.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.120]   But make sure that you don't get put in a place
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.480]   where you're alone in a private, concealed place
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.140]   with someone of the opposite sex to whom you're not married.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.520]   You'll stick out like a sore thumb
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.640]   and you'll be mocked mercilessly
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.280]   if anybody finds out that you practice this habit.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.240]   But those same people who mock you mercilessly today
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.080]   are the ones who will tear you limb from limb
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.980]   if there's an accusation of any kind against you.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.240]   So you're gonna be mocked either way.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.920]   So you might as well be mocked
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.560]   for doing something that is good.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.200]   You know, I think we all would like sometimes
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.480]   to be able to control what other people say.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.800]   You've never been able to control what other people say.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.260]   And I'll tell you what, if you wanna be humbled,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.840]   just go on the internet and read what they say about you.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.240]   Don't do it if you're not ready to be humbled.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.280]   But you can't control what people say.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.520]   You have no control whatsoever over what other people say,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.440]   whether they say good things or bad things.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.860]   You can't do that.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.800]   The only thing you can control is what you do.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.520]   And what happens is that there are always people
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.240]   who sit around and who all they do
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:10.340]   is consistently jab and tell lies.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.140]   You can always find somebody telling lies about you.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.260]   But the people who are serious,
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.220]   they'll look to see what you actually do,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.340]   and they'll appreciate the things that you actually do.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.360]   And it's very important that if you're going
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.380]   to be criticized, if you're going to face mocking,
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.340]   at least make sure that your actions
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:35.340]   and your reputation are with you.
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.200]   Again, reading from, this time I read
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.720]   from the book of 1 Peter.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.380]   And again, for those of you who aren't Bible readers,
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.560]   there are two letters that we have
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.320]   that are written by the hand of Peter,
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.100]   or written in those days, most of the time,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.480]   they dictated them.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:54.000]   So Peter was probably the most prominent
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.220]   of the 12 disciples of Jesus when Jesus was walking around
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.760]   and followed by his disciples and teaching publicly
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.880]   there in the land of Israel.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.640]   And Peter was one of his 12 disciples.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.900]   And he was the one who, they say,
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.020]   oh, he's putting his foot in his mouth.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.220]   And he was very, very, very, well, he wrote two letters,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.460]   which are recorded in the back of the Bible,
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.660]   1 Peter and 2 Peter.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.580]   He also basically was responsible for the content
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.940]   of the book of Mark in the Bible.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.500]   So I always think of the book of Mark
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.340]   as the gospel of Peter.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.780]   But there's a little story behind that
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.900]   that you can research on your own.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.740]   But one of these two letters, in the book of 1 Peter,
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.340]   this passage to me has been of great comfort
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.540]   over the years as I've learned how to deal
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.000]   with the fact that people are gonna mock me
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.040]   no matter what I do.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.480]   And so how should I approach it?
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.720]   In the book of 1 Peter, chapter two,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:42.560]   Peter writes this, he says,
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.120]   "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   "to abstain from the passions of the flesh
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.180]   "which wage war against your soul.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.680]   "Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable,
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.360]   "so that when they speak against you as evildoers,
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.760]   "they may see your good deeds and glorify God
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.480]   "on the day of visitation."
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.400]   And then a few verses later, Peter writes this.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.900]   He says, "For what credit is it if when you sin
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.140]   "and are beaten for it, you endure?
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.800]   "But if when you do good and suffer for it, you endure.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.400]   "This is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.700]   "For to this you have been called,
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.640]   "because Christ also suffered for you,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.860]   "leaving you an example so that you might
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.300]   "follow in his steps.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.060]   "He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.480]   "When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.760]   "When he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   "but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly."
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:42.160]   You can't control what people say about you,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.160]   but what you can do is live honorably
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.400]   and conduct yourself honorably.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.160]   So be careful.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.320]   And most importantly, since today's show
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.580]   is addressed to men, protect the woman
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.100]   that you're interacting with for her safety
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.820]   and for her good name, protect her.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.360]   Now, here are some things that you need to be aware of.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.840]   Just number one, you think it's a small thing.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:08.960]   It's not a small thing.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:15.000]   A classic blackmail scheme against powerful men
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.640]   has been to send a beautiful woman
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.360]   to that powerful man to seduce him,
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.520]   to put him into a compromising situation
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.920]   that is either actually compromising
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.980]   or just simply looks compromising,
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.740]   and then to collect evidence,
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.580]   maybe a picture taken by somebody else,
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.620]   thus setting up an opportunity for blackmail.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.540]   This has been a consistent, consistent thing.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.780]   You go study a little bit of spy history
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.480]   and you'll find that's a classic blackmail scheme.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.940]   So the more you come to prominence,
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:53.060]   the more important that it is that you be careful.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.820]   You never know, someday you might wind up,
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.800]   I hope not, someday you might wind up
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.960]   as President of the United States,
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.560]   and then it's gonna be, well, what's your reputation?
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   And back to, just a moment, so this kind of practice,
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.040]   I think it's a very healthy practice.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.440]   It's important for you and it's important to protect
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.880]   those with whom you interact, is to be careful.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.640]   And don't allow yourself to be alone
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.120]   in a private, concealed place
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.080]   with someone of the opposite sex to whom you're not married.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.280]   And it's not because you're somehow,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.960]   you can't control yourself,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.800]   although frankly, you can't control yourself.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.580]   Better men than you and better men than I,
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:33.520]   when they allow themselves to walk down that path,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.200]   just halfway, better men than you and I have fallen.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.160]   It's not that, it's a matter of reputation.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.600]   Protect yourself.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.280]   So I was amazed, this created the big news of,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:53.160]   when Mike Pence, it's called the Billy Graham rule,
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.960]   I guess in modern vernacular,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.640]   'cause Billy Graham would always
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.120]   kind of follow this practice.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.980]   And so Mike Pence became known a few months ago
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.240]   that he followed this practice.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.800]   And he was excoriated and destroyed,
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.280]   Vice President Mike Pence, he was destroyed in the press
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.560]   by those who say, this is despicable,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.200]   this is the same kind of constant male patriarchy
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.280]   that women have to face and that women
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.980]   don't ever get an opportunity to get ahead
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.980]   because they're not gonna be there in the inside deals.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:32.160]   And I was amazed after the Harvey Weinstein account
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.280]   to read a story about David Schwimmer,
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.240]   one of the leading actors on "Friends,"
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.200]   who some, a journalist wrote about how,
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.640]   or an actress, I guess, wrote about how
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.760]   David Schwimmer was such a good man that they were,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.520]   she was, journalist, she was doing an interview over dinner
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.280]   and with David Schwimmer and he said,
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.840]   it was loud and they were having a hard time
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.280]   finishing their interview and he said,
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.560]   would you like to go up to my room to finish the interview
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.760]   and I'll make sure that somebody else is there.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.560]   And she just thought that was so sweet and so thoughtful.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:04.000]   It was sweet and it was thoughtful and it was important.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.840]   We should honor David Schwimmer for that.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.760]   But that's what these people will do.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.200]   If they like you, they'll stick up and say, hey, it's great.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.080]   If they don't like you, they'll say
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.600]   it's the worst thing ever.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.080]   You can't change that.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.080]   What you can do is, what you can do is protect yourself.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.280]   So it's very, very simple, but make sure
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.040]   that you put the habits into place around the office.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.080]   Make sure that you have a window on your office
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.920]   so you don't have a private office.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.840]   Make sure that you leave the door open.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.480]   Make sure that if you're gonna meet with somebody,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.280]   meet with them in a public place.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.580]   Make sure that you are open and up front.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.680]   Bring somebody with you.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.560]   If you need to meet with somebody in private,
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.680]   bring a trusted compatriot with you, a trusted confidant.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.800]   There's always somebody available.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.560]   There's always somebody available.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.560]   And if not, if you need to talk privately,
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.120]   then figure it out.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.640]   Anyway, I don't need to go into more and more,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   but figure it out.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.320]   Be careful when traveling.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.900]   One of the biggest challenges,
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.680]   especially for us as men, is traveling.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.440]   If you're a person of prominence, personally,
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.800]   I don't think you should travel alone.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.320]   Frankly, I wish that most of us
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.560]   didn't have to travel alone.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.840]   But it's really hard to see how it's possible to do that.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.240]   I still travel alone.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.520]   But I hope to stop that pretty soon.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.900]   I'm very much looking forward for when my oldest child
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.080]   is able to be quiet and controlled
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.460]   for extended periods of time
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.260]   so that I can take my children with me.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.440]   Now, obviously, that fits into my goal of benefits for him,
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.800]   my oldest son, or my daughter when she's old enough.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.040]   I want them to be with me in adult situations
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.840]   so that they can have perspective on the world
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.040]   that starts from an early age.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.280]   But part of that's also for me.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:51.200]   It's good protection for me to have my children with me.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.240]   And if you are a person of public prominence,
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.400]   here would be one where I think
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.560]   you need to assess your situation.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.240]   But if you're a person of public prominence,
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.120]   you should spend the extra money not to travel alone.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.600]   Travel with your staff.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.220]   Travel with a business partner.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.600]   Travel with your children.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.120]   Travel with your spouse.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.680]   But make sure there's somebody there with you
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.000]   because traveling is tough.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.840]   And it's really, really tough
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   to maintain your faithfulness to your wife
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.040]   when you're on the road.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.840]   Business travel, especially for many men,
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.400]   is the place where they indulge,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.260]   and probably many women, I don't know, but for men,
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.960]   is the place where they indulge the lust of the flesh
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.760]   because they have a level of safety.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.160]   You've got to avoid that.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.640]   So when traveling, avoid difficult situations
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.720]   whenever possible.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.600]   It's pretty lonely to be the killjoy,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.020]   but it's worth it.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:57.740]   It's pretty lonely to go home
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.240]   or to go back to your hotel room all alone
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.880]   when the boys are headed to the strip club
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.480]   for an evening of client entertainment,
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.600]   but go home anyway.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.720]   It's worth it when you can walk in the front door
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.040]   and greet your wife with a clear conscience.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.760]   It's worth it.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.680]   One thing that helps me is I always look at my daughter.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.840]   I have a beautiful little baby girl.
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.160]   And it's funny, actually, as I wrote these notes,
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.200]   she woke up from her nap a little earlier today.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.240]   She woke up from her nap, and she was sitting in my lap,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.600]   and I always look at my daughter, and I just think,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.720]   every woman that's out there was once
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.040]   a daddy's little daughter, just like mine.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.840]   Cute little pigtails in her hair,
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.740]   sweet, innocent little girls, never known anything wrong.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.000]   That woman
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.160]   was once somebody's little girl, and probably still is.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.440]   Somebody's little girl.
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.600]   Do I want my daughter being treated
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.400]   the way that these men are treating this woman right now?
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.480]   I find that's a very helpful
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.600]   and anchoring situation to be in.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.720]   It's one thing to look at somebody
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   playing the harlot in the street
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.480]   and be filled with lust for them.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.280]   It's another thing to see them as somebody's little girl.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.520]   I don't want my little girl in that situation,
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   so why should I treat somebody else's little girl like that?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.760]   If you don't have a daughter, consider a niece,
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.680]   or find somebody with a beautiful baby girl,
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.400]   and look at the innocence of a beautiful little baby girl,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.080]   and recognize that those women
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.400]   that you're destroying with your action
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.680]   are somebody's baby girl.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.080]   So whatever you've got to do to protect yourself
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.140]   when traveling, do it.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:57.540]   Spend the extra money to meet someone at a restaurant.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.640]   In today's world, especially in the modern business climate,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.880]   I think it's best for you to keep your mouth shut
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.600]   about your reasons.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.880]   Many women, especially many businesswomen,
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.120]   would be deeply insulted
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.880]   if you talk about your reasoning
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.960]   for why you want to meet them in a public place
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.160]   or something like that.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.400]   Or many women, especially businesswomen,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.560]   if you're going on a business trip
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.380]   and you have a female coworker with you,
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.720]   they will be deeply insulted
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.760]   if you open your mouth and say a word
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.920]   about why you prefer to go back to your room
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.520]   and dine alone in the evening.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:39.120]   I try not to insult people,
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.520]   and I try not to make people feel insulted.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.840]   So I think it's best for you to be reserved
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.360]   in telling them why you do something.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.120]   I guess I've ruined it with recording a show,
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.440]   but I would never tell from traveling
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.040]   with a female business companion or coworker,
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:55.880]   I wouldn't tell her why I'm doing something,
[00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.360]   I'm just gonna do it.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.800]   If you gotta be weird, fine, be weird,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.500]   but just, you can be the loner if you need to.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.080]   But spend the extra money, do whatever's necessary,
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.120]   and make sure that you protect yourself,
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.680]   protect your wife, and protect the people
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.920]   that you're working with.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.240]   Avoid alcohol when you're traveling.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.800]   Alcohol leads to poor decision-making and poor judgment.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.560]   And don't risk it, especially when you're vulnerable
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.920]   when you're on the road.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.280]   There's this constant cycle.
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.360]   You spend enough time in business hotels and business bars,
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:30.280]   and you will see this cycle again and again and again.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.600]   Businessman, hard time at home,
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.960]   screaming kids, clamoring for his attention,
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.760]   tired wife, he's having a hard time at home.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.440]   Well, when he's on his trip, he can hang out and be alone.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.000]   He can be with the guys and have a good time.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.120]   He's got beautiful coworkers that he can hang out with
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.560]   who are fun, who are smart, who are intelligent.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.040]   And his wife is busy with the children,
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.660]   and she doesn't have fun things to say,
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.640]   but the person, the coworker at work
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.160]   has lots of fun things to say.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.080]   And so we'll start having a few drinks,
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.640]   and we'll be having a great time,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.800]   and one thing leads to another.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.040]   And all of a sudden, you're in a situation
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.540]   that you didn't want to be in.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:12.540]   Don't destroy your marriage,
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.180]   and don't destroy your financial life with your infidelity.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:22.320]   You cannot say no when you're 50% down that road.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.920]   You've got to say no when you're 0% down that road.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:28.720]   So avoid alcohol.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.960]   If you're with a bunch of people
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.160]   and abstaining totally is problematic,
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.600]   maybe you're the one entertaining,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.880]   you're the one, different business situations are difficult,
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.160]   but if abstaining totally is problematic, have one drink.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.720]   Here's a little tip.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   Have one drink with everybody.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   If you're in a situation that's problematic,
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.400]   have one drink with everyone,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   then go to the restroom, stop at the bar on your way back,
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.320]   and get yourself a Coke, put a lime in it from the bar,
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.560]   and keep that drink topped off from the bar directly.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.500]   Gives you an easy excuse to avoid more drinks,
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.040]   looks like you're drinking a rum and Coke,
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.080]   and all the drunk people will never know.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.280]   Drunk people are pretty stupid, so avoid it.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.200]   Whatever you got to do, put those things in place.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:15.760]   Avoid pornography of all kinds at all costs,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.360]   and put fences around yourself
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.720]   so that you're able to stand when you're tempted
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.520]   and when you're alone.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.280]   I was deeply addicted to pornography during my teenage years
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.240]   and it has caused me years, years of problems,
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.560]   and years of tears because of it.
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.880]   And it's probably, I'm convinced,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.760]   it's the number one addiction in our modern world today,
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   and it has deep, deep impact.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.400]   Pornography at use and the associated masturbation
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.640]   with pornography puts grooves in your brain,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.900]   pleasure pathways that are reliably associated
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:53.100]   with a perfect release at the end of the process,
[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.380]   and those grooves go deep.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.500]   Now they can be undone in actually
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.780]   a really short period of time,
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:06.560]   but pornography is so deeply destructive.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:13.580]   I'm gonna skip the three-hour talk on this subject,
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.100]   but it's probably the number one destroyer
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.720]   of men and women today.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.440]   It destroys everything good.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.060]   Pornography destroys good sex between husbands and wives.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:30.060]   It puts this picture of sex as the way
[00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.020]   that God designed it to be,
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.620]   a beautiful and intimate and caring,
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.460]   and it causes it to be,
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:41.740]   it gives men and women these weird ideas
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.180]   about what's normal.
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.700]   It's interesting, there's so much research
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:49.700]   that's been done about sexual practice among teenagers.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.780]   There's so much research that's been done on this subject
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.300]   about sexual practice among teenagers,
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.580]   and there's all these teenage girls
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.580]   who are going and studying pornography
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.660]   to learn sexual technique
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.820]   because their teenage boyfriends want them to do
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.220]   what they're doing in the porn,
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:15.780]   and nothing, nothing in pornography
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.380]   is devoted to the sexual pleasure of a woman.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.540]   Everything in pornography is devoted
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:27.420]   to the sexual titillation of a man with imagery,
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.500]   and it causes men to have these just utterly,
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:34.660]   just destroyed ideas about good sex.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.220]   Now, you wanna rip your marriage apart,
[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.000]   and you wanna talk about the financial impact
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.580]   of divorce on your life?
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:44.660]   Well, start feeding yourself pornography,
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:46.860]   or continue feeding yourself pornography,
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.860]   and then start treating your wife
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:55.020]   the way that you see a male porn actor
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.840]   treat a female porn actor.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.060]   Your marriage will not last
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.180]   because your wife is smart enough to know
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.060]   that that is not the way that men treat women,
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.980]   or men should treat women.
[00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.940]   You wanna grow her love cold for you?
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.560]   Start treating her that way.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.980]   Pornography will destroy your life.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:19.340]   I've been there, I know, and I'm so thankful.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.780]   I'm so thankful that God delivered me from it,
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.780]   but frankly, the impact is brutal to escape,
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:35.660]   brutal to escape, and even today,
[00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.900]   it's hard for me to do a show like this
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.420]   because it kinda puts me out there,
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.980]   and it says, "Joshua, you're taking the stand,"
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.980]   and I fear, I fear being put back into that place
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:54.300]   of fallenness, and it's only faith
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.820]   that allows me to even talk on this stuff publicly,
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:02.820]   but don't let it happen, and so, men, get help.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.100]   Talk to other men.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.520]   Talk, talk, get help.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.900]   There are resources, get help,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.020]   and the other thing that's just so utterly destructive,
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.620]   pornography destroys women.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:15.980]   If you wanna cry, look at your little daughter,
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.180]   and then go and start reading about the women
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.380]   who are involved in pornography
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.740]   and how their lives are destroyed,
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:23.900]   and you call yourself a man,
[00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:29.420]   and you wanna portray yourself as somebody upright,
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.460]   somebody who desires for justice and righteousness,
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.900]   and you wanna destroy lives with your consumption,
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.100]   I'm preaching to myself
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.040]   'cause I have to constantly preach to myself.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.220]   Those old grooves in the brain,
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.900]   they can be relatively quickly, actually.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.420]   They can be very quickly wiped out.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:56.740]   They can be, but to wipe them out completely
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:01.460]   is very, very tough, so build fences around yourself.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.700]   Don't stay gone from home long,
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:05.100]   and I'm focusing on traveling.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:08.580]   If you think I'm overdoing this, either,
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.540]   I can't imagine, if you think I'm laboring too long
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:16.100]   on this travel thing, I would submit to you
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:17.580]   you might not have much experience
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.420]   in the world of business travel.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:20.980]   But don't stay gone from home long.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.580]   Schedule your itinerary so that you're home
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.060]   as quickly as you can be if you're alone.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:27.820]   Schedule activities in your itinerary
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.460]   so you're not sitting in a hotel room bored silly.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:32.260]   Don't give place to the devil.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.540]   Don't give place to the flesh.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.780]   Develop a routine for your hotel room.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.060]   When you're checking in the lobby,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.740]   cancel the adult channels in the lobby
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.500]   when you're checking in on the hotel,
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.220]   or walk in the room and unplug the TV first thing
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.060]   and lock the TV remote in the safe
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.580]   so you're not even tempted to turn it on.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.300]   I've heard of some men who make a practice
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.620]   of walk in the room and immediately connect
[00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.740]   their phone or another phone, an iPad or an iPod Touch
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:58.980]   or something to the Wi-Fi, and immediately set up
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.700]   a video link with their home.
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.100]   Think about how that, if you wanna talk about
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.140]   your building love with your wife,
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   just let her know you care, and that you're putting
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.500]   the things in place to protect yourself.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.020]   So setting up a video link with home
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.540]   so it feels like you're there with your wife
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.340]   and your children, and gives you greater accountability.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.780]   If the phone's a problem, take a backup phone.
[00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:22.900]   Leave your smartphone and your computer locked in the car.
[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.860]   Take a dumb phone without internet access
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:25.820]   with you into your room.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.780]   Whatever you've gotta do, put software on your phone,
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.260]   your computer, whatever you've gotta do, protect yourself.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:36.260]   And the higher you go, the more you must protect yourself.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.460]   You will develop, if you go on for success,
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.460]   and you come to a place of prominence, of effectiveness,
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.700]   you will attract to yourself a retinue of enemies,
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:53.360]   and you must not give your enemies even a shred of ammo.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:59.540]   Now there's a lot more to it, I know,
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.420]   but one of the most, other things,
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.980]   one of the most troubling questions to me in today's world
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.060]   has even been how do you protect yourself
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.820]   from allegations of child abuse?
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.180]   This one's really just troubling to me
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.820]   'cause it seems like the normal, natural things
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:20.380]   of life are kinda taken away.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.040]   I care about some of the young boys
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.980]   and young men in my neighborhood,
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.680]   and I look at the men and I don't see any father figures
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.100]   in their life, and I wanna, to bring them along,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.940]   and I wanna help them, and I wanna do things with them
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.700]   and to help them and to encourage them.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.820]   And I constantly face this question of what do I do?
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:41.380]   We've become such a society
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.020]   that's so fractured just with allegations
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:46.220]   that it's hard for me to say even,
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.460]   okay, here are some boys in my neighborhood
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.460]   who have probably never been on a camping trip,
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.700]   have probably never been in the woods,
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.460]   have probably never gone hunting,
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:56.820]   have probably never shot a bow and arrow,
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.360]   who've probably never shot a gun,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.280]   who've probably never, how do I do things for these boys?
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.440]   But yet there's such a destructive idea
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.220]   where everyone's looking for the homosexual predator.
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.340]   And I don't know the answers, I really don't.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.180]   I talk with my wife about it, and I just say,
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.620]   how do we, it's tough because on the one hand,
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.740]   there's this total bondage
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.980]   where you try to walk up rightly,
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.360]   and on the other hand, if you even open your mouth
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.220]   and talk about the fact that you're trying to do this,
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.700]   and everybody says, well, you're a prude, and what?
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   You can't control yourself?
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.780]   And they behave as though,
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.240]   they behave as though it doesn't matter,
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.720]   and you can just do whatever you want
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   and live however you want,
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.360]   but then all of a sudden it turns on you,
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.240]   and now the next thing you know, you're being destroyed.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.740]   It's deeply frustrating to me,
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.280]   and I don't know the right answers from some of that.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.260]   I will not let the fear or the threat
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.120]   of these people who destroy everything,
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.740]   I will not let those people destroy
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.820]   how important it is that we sow
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.360]   into the lives of other people.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   I will not let my fatherly love and care
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.600]   for the well-being of a disadvantaged boy
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.720]   in my neighborhood,
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:19.960]   I will not let that become something that turns,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.680]   and the whole normal cycle of life
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.960]   of elder people sowing into the lives
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.160]   of young boys and girls,
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   I will not let that whole thing be sexualized
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   by our culture that worships at the altar
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.480]   of erotic control.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.320]   The number one most powerful thing
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.980]   that anybody cares about is ultimate erotic freedom
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.480]   until all of a sudden they turn on you and say,
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.720]   "Ah, it's not about erotic freedom."
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.940]   I will not let the normal things of life
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.560]   and the important things of life be destroyed by that,
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.360]   but I also don't know how to do it.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.720]   I gotta figure out how do we deal with it?
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.920]   How do we deal with it?
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.320]   You know, when I was younger,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.800]   there was a neighbor of mine,
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.360]   and I was talking about this the other day
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   with my wife.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.960]   There was a neighbor of mine who was this older guy.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.480]   He was disabled from work,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.840]   and just this older guy, country guy,
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.440]   and he was really kind to me,
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.360]   and he was the kind of guy,
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.720]   he was kind of foul-mouthed.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.520]   He was a country guy, kind of foul-mouthed,
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.040]   smoked a lot, drank a little here and there.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.280]   He's the kind of guy who I would probably
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.080]   never let my children be with him today,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.560]   but my parents let me be with him,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.280]   and of course they knew what was going on,
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.800]   but he was a good guy.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:37.040]   He was the old-fashioned kind of just good guy.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.920]   He wasn't a Christian,
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.760]   but he was just an old-fashioned good guy,
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.320]   kind of that moral, upright,
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.760]   but very country, foul-mouthed guy,
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.640]   and he was an older man,
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.040]   and I used to hang out with him for hours,
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.000]   and I would,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.520]   I went fishing with him.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.360]   I'd hang out and work in his garden with him.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.600]   He was the guy who taught me to raise rabbits,
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.400]   and we'd work on rabbits.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.880]   We'd butcher rabbits together.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.120]   He was just this old country guy,
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.640]   and he taught me all kinds of interesting things.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.520]   Never once
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:17.240]   did he try to teach me about anything inappropriate.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.200]   Never once did he try to
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.440]   to do anything that was wrong in any way,
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.600]   and yet today,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.160]   I don't think I would let my son hang out
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.000]   with someone like that,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.080]   and I hate that.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.880]   I hate that.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.720]   I don't know what to do.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.760]   I don't know how to solve these problems.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.160]   Forgive me if a little bit of rambling here,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.640]   but I guess the show has just been personal enough
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.080]   that I figured I would share that pain,
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.320]   so just protect yourself.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.520]   Today, just to the allegation,
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.080]   proven or not, unfortunately,
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.600]   the allegation, proven or not, evidence or not,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.280]   that allegation is enough to destroy you,
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.480]   and we've gotta figure out how to deal
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.200]   with this new reality that we face.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.160]   Let me just kind of wrap this up to a close.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.240]   One of the most important,
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.520]   I've done a lot of Bible reading here,
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.560]   one of the most important passages
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.280]   would come from Ephesians 5,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.920]   and I think it gives us a clear place
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.120]   to put this subject to rest,
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.840]   but let me just read for you from Ephesians 5.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.720]   If you're not a Bible reader,
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.880]   this is another letter written by the Apostle Paul,
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.800]   and he says this.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.360]   "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children,
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.080]   and walk in love, as Christ loved us
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.160]   and gave himself up for us,
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.440]   a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.400]   But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.080]   must not even be named among you,
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.520]   as is proper among saints.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.960]   Let there be no filthiness, nor foolish talk,
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.800]   nor crude joking which are out of place,
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.680]   but instead let there be thanksgiving.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.880]   For you may be sure of this,
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.160]   that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.720]   or who is covetous, that is an idolater,
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.160]   has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.000]   Let no one deceive you with empty words,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.160]   for because of these things,
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.760]   the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.040]   Therefore, do not become partners with them,
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.680]   for at one time you were darkness,
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.760]   but now you are light in the Lord.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.080]   Walk as children of light,
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.680]   for the fruit of light is found in all
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.360]   that is good and right and true.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.080]   And try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.640]   Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.400]   but instead expose them.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.360]   For it is shameful even to speak of the things
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.840]   that they do in secret,
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.520]   but when anything is exposed by the light,
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.880]   it becomes visible.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.520]   For anything that becomes visible is light.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.000]   Therefore it says, "Awake, O sleeper,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.060]   "and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.560]   Look carefully then how you walk,
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.240]   not as unwise, but as wise,
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.840]   making the best use of the time,
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.600]   because the days are evil.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.240]   Therefore do not be foolish,
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.600]   but understand what the will of the Lord is.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.960]   And do not get drunk with wine,
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   for that is debauchery,
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.560]   but be filled with the Spirit,
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.320]   addressing one another in psalms and hymns
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.280]   and spiritual songs,
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.960]   singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.440]   giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:23.360]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.060]   submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:31.420]   I don't need to add much to that.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:36.220]   But I would just say, men, we start with us.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.260]   We start with us,
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.680]   and then we start with those who are nearby.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.100]   One of the questions that I have
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.260]   is just so many of these women have come forward.
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.340]   The thing that angers me,
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:50.540]   where are the men who are gonna stand up and act like men?
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.300]   What are the husbands of these women doing?
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.200]   What are their fathers doing?
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.920]   Sending their daughters off into a place
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.720]   where they're gonna be preyed on by,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:02.220]   where they're gonna be preyed on.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.160]   How do those fathers look at themselves in their face
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.720]   when they send their daughter in that situation
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.200]   where she's defenseless,
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.880]   and then she becomes a victim of a great evil
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.200]   and she can't tell anyone?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.460]   What kind of environment has been created?
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.440]   What kind of love and trust is there
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   where this woman is put into this situation?
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.500]   What are the husbands of these women doing?
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.700]   You and I can't do anything about those men,
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.780]   but we had better not fail the women that we care about.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.660]   We had better not fail our wives
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.340]   and our mothers and our daughters.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:45.460]   We better be the ones to stand up for them.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:48.980]   There was a day,
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.580]   I don't know if this was a good thing or a bad thing,
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.060]   but it certainly indicates something.
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.660]   There was a day when the brother
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.460]   of a woman whose honor was besmirched
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.740]   would go and deal with the man.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:02.180]   There was a day when a father would go and deal with that,
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.940]   and today, we as men kinda say,
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:04.860]   oh, well, she's her own,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.340]   she's gotta stand her own two feet.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.140]   Yes, women have to bear the responsibility
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:11.340]   of what they have wanted to do,
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.620]   and a lot of women are pretty offended
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:18.620]   if you take on any kind of even just a tone
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.020]   or a desire and indicate your desire to protect her.
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.500]   That doesn't matter.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.660]   You gotta do it anyway because it's right.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.000]   Now, I'm not saying that you should go and get a shotgun,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.140]   but probably in some cases, you should,
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.100]   and make sure that if there's a woman in your life
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.700]   who's victimized, you better make sure
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.420]   that she feels safe to come
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.940]   and that you're gonna deal with whatever needs to be done
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:43.900]   to deal with it.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:49.060]   Now, one final area of importance for you,
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.260]   and I think this is very, very important,
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.980]   especially in light of the allegations
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.340]   against Judge Roy Moore.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   I hope it's been clear that allegations are important,
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:05.860]   and my job, especially for somebody who's a politician,
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.060]   it's not my job to jump on Harvey Weinstein.
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.460]   It's not my deal, I mean, in the sense that
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.900]   if he's close to me, but I'm not gonna go out
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.340]   and pick fights with people,
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:19.340]   but I will be the first to roast someone like Roy Moore
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.100]   and hold him accountable 'cause that's my job
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.860]   is to hold those accountable who are near me,
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.500]   myself and those who are near me.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.460]   So, but in the scenario that he's in,
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:36.460]   in the sense that the allegations, if they're true,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.460]   those allegations against him were a long time ago.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.020]   So, I wanna speak straight to you, men,
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.820]   because I don't wanna see you become successful
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.740]   in the future and then have a skeleton from your past,
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.220]   a sin from your past come out and destroy you.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:56.700]   What do you do if you've committed sin in the past?
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.460]   What do you do if there's something in your life
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.580]   from the past?
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.780]   You repent.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.700]   Today, now, you repent of your sin
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.420]   and you go and you make the situation right.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.860]   You repent first and foremost to God
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.740]   because he's the one that you've wronged
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:16.260]   and then you go and you repent
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.140]   before the person that you've wronged.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:22.740]   And you may seek to make the situation right
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.180]   in every way possible.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.740]   If you've stolen, you need to go back
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:29.140]   and you need to make restitution
[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.820]   to the person that you've stolen from.
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.500]   If you've wronged somebody, you need to go back
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.980]   and you need to apologize to the people that you've wronged,
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:39.580]   ask for their forgiveness, and you need to go back
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:42.380]   and do anything you can to restore what's right.
[01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.820]   Some things can be restored.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.300]   If you stole money, you can go back and make restitution
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.700]   and pay the debt that you owe.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:53.660]   If you took a life, you can't bring life back.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.180]   If there's crime, you need to go and submit yourself
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.700]   to the governing authorities and confess your crime
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.900]   and face it.
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.500]   You need to go back and repent and face it.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.660]   And you need to repent.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:12.020]   I wanna say publicly, but not always necessarily publicly,
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.260]   but at least to the people involved.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:18.220]   One of the biggest issues that I have with modern,
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.780]   and it's just speaking theologically,
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.660]   one of the biggest issues that I have
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.540]   with modern mainstream popular Christianity
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.780]   is we've adopted this myth that somehow repentance
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.020]   is this thing where you kinda say,
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:33.060]   well, I'm sorry, God, and that absolves everything.
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.500]   Repentance needs to go much deeper.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   You need to repent from anything,
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:40.260]   from any sin before God that you committed in the past,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.980]   and then go and make those things right
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.020]   and demonstrate deeds of repentance.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.940]   Now, there's no possibility.
[01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:48.700]   It is utterly impossible for you to ever
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.100]   fully make everything right,
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.140]   and it's impossible for you to ever fully repent
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.300]   of every single sin, but if there's something
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.620]   that's on your mind or there's something
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:13:01.100]   that's on your conscience, go and repent and make it right.
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.660]   Make it right now while you have the chance
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.860]   to make restitution lest you stand before God
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.720]   and experience His wrath for that sin.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:13.820]   The foremost foundation of Christian conversion
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.820]   is repentance, repentance, and it's a word
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.260]   that unfortunately, and I apologize to you
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.940]   on behalf of, if you're not a believer,
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.540]   I apologize to you on behalf
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.980]   of my fellow Christian believers.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.060]   We have failed this generation,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.620]   and that failure is reflected into my own shame
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.780]   frequently on the front page of newspapers
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.420]   when so-called Christian leaders
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.780]   who want to put themselves forward
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.740]   and preach from a pulpit, and all of a sudden,
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.580]   it turned out to be engaging in sexual immorality
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.060]   with whomever, trying to be careful with my language.
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.180]   It's so deeply shameful,
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.060]   and it destroys the testimony of God,
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.740]   and it's to our own fault, and we will bear
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.940]   the consequences of it in coming generations.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:17.820]   We already are, but that doesn't make it,
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.860]   that doesn't make repentance optional.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:23.020]   Just because the modern Christian church
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:25.580]   has somehow decided that repentance is optional
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.020]   and it's just a matter of come to Jesus
[01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.580]   'cause He's gonna make you feel good,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:32.500]   that doesn't violate the fact that repentance
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.780]   is the very first step of turning from sin.
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:41.180]   Now, I'm not recording this show
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.420]   as a get-rich-quick plan for you,
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.900]   but if there's sin in your life from the past
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.980]   that you have not made right,
[01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:50.860]   or have not sought to make right,
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.740]   if there's crime, if there's evil,
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.060]   if there's infidelity, if there's those things,
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.960]   that needs to be dealt with today.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   Otherwise, I guarantee you, your sin will find you out.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.460]   You may go and build a career for 40 years,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.420]   and be running for high political office,
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.980]   or getting ready to go and release your great new movie,
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.080]   and on the night of your release,
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.500]   the director may look and say, "Guess what?
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.660]   "This person's just become a liability."
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.380]   And my hope is not to persuade you of that
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:25.020]   so that you can somehow get more money and be richer.
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.380]   My hope is to persuade you of that
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.540]   because it's the right thing to do.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:33.140]   Though it cost you everything, every dollar you have,
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.240]   to go and make right those you've wronged.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.660]   If you used a corporation and you abused people,
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.540]   go and make it right.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.580]   Though it cost you your entire fortune,
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:46.220]   go and make it as right as you can,
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:51.720]   because it's far better to be completely penniless
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:55.960]   and morally upright,
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.500]   and stand before God with a clear conscience,
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.380]   than to enjoy the pleasures of sinful,
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.600]   ill-begotten wealth for a season,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.140]   and face your eternal damnation in hell.
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:18.180]   In 500 episodes of "Radical Personal Finance,"
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:20.380]   I can't remember a show
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.600]   in which I've been perhaps this intense.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:28.240]   I'm seeking to speak intensely because it's that important.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:32.660]   And if you want proof of it, open up your newspaper.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:38.620]   Though I may die and disappear,
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.940]   and though God may judge the modern Christian church
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:44.260]   for our unfaithfulness in our modern era,
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.100]   you will still be exposed.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.380]   These men and women in Hollywood,
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.480]   I hear very little Christian testimony.
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.480]   Just watch how God's using them
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.800]   to expose the evil and the sin
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.640]   that is pervasive in that community.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.080]   If Judge Roy Moore is guilty of what is alleged against him,
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.360]   just watch how God's using a staff of reporters
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:20.240]   on a Washington Post news reporting team,
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.740]   which if, maybe there's a believer somewhere in that group,
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.180]   but if there is, I don't know how they keep their job.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:33.180]   Look at how God is using the non-believing secular people
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.780]   that run the Washington Post
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.860]   to expose the sin of the professing Christian,
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.440]   if that is true.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.980]   I don't know, and I want to be careful
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.340]   with my judgments I've said all the way through.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.220]   I'm not close.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.860]   I don't know if I'll ever know.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.700]   Doesn't matter.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.380]   Look at the shame.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:56.340]   If those allegations against Judge Roy Moore
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:00.060]   are proven to be true, look at the shame,
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:03.460]   the shame that the church members and the friends
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.520]   and the Christians around Moore will face
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.000]   for their lack of movement and activity.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.220]   God will use just about anybody to accomplish his purposes.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.780]   It's a privilege to be involved in that,
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:25.580]   but if you don't stand up, he'll go use someone else,
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.580]   and if you don't fix it, if you don't confess it
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.540]   while you have time, the Bible says today
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.820]   is the day of salvation.
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.760]   If you do not harden your hearts,
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.780]   today is the day of salvation.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:39.660]   Today is the day that you can go back
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.580]   and repent of your sins in the past
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.200]   and turn towards God and ask him for his forgiveness.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.520]   Today is the day.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.360]   (sniffling)
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.200]   Today.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:57.920]   The longer you wait, the harder it is.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.320]   The longer you wait, the harder it is.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.800]   Just think about this.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.880]   If those allegations against Judge Moore
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.560]   are proven to be true, think about the destruction
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.140]   on his family, his wife, his children, his grandchildren.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.480]   (sniffling)
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:23.020]   The longer you wait, the harder it is.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.680]   (sniffling)
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:32.500]   Hope you'll forgive me.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.740]   I'm not doing this for effect.
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:38.420]   I didn't plan this.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:39.340]   I'm just, this is.
[01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.040]   (sniffling)
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.120]   (crying)
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:20:05.000]   I didn't set out to preach to you.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.080]   My friend, today is the day
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.440]   we face.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:18.000]   Today is the day.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.200]   Don't let another day pass.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.640]   If there's something in your past, I beg you, repent.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.800]   Don't.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.500]   Confess to your wife, confess to your husband,
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.120]   confess to those that you've wronged.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.400]   Make the situation right.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.080]   It'll never get better.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.880]   Just get, we'll get worse and worse.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:41.360]   And someday, you may watch, I hope not.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.520]   I hope, I pray that these allegations against Moore are wrong.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.840]   I hope, I pray that they're proven wrong.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.280]   'Cause it's just such a deep shame if they're proven right.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.160]   It's so deeply shameful
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.920]   to find out when somebody is out preaching publicly
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.640]   and yet they're a hypocrite.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.820]   It's hard to think of a deeper shame than hypocrisy.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.960]   I don't wanna see anybody's life destroyed.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.920]   I don't wanna see Harvey Weinstein's marriage
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.960]   and his children hurt.
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.000]   I don't wanna see Judge Moore's marriage
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.040]   and his children and grandchildren hurt.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.080]   But friends, the wages of sin is death.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.960]   And this behavior, this sin, brings death
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.700]   and it will destroy everything.
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:37.160]   We live in strange times.
[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.720]   I think every generation before us has felt that.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:47.440]   My friend, we live in strange times.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.960]   I cannot for the life of me figure out
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.920]   by what standard modern sexual activity is judged.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.560]   I cannot figure it out.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:56.800]   I study it and I try to think.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.960]   I pretend, I say, okay, pretend I'm an atheist,
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.160]   pretend I'm a progressive, pretend I'm a feminist,
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.200]   pretend I'm these things and I just think and I study.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.320]   And you know what, there are a lot of criticisms
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.520]   that are just and that are right.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.680]   There are a lot of criticisms
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.040]   and I can see those criticisms,
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.500]   but then I go back and I say, by what standard?
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.560]   By what standard do we judge?
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.960]   And the only standard that I can come up with today
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.960]   is consent.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.800]   Like that seems to be, in terms of the religious doctrine
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   that is taught today about the appropriate
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.880]   sexual activity for men and women,
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.040]   the standard seems to be consent.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:32.920]   That's it.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.280]   As long as there are consenting people,
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.000]   consenting adults who are engaged in the sexual activity,
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.840]   everything else is possible.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.000]   And nothing else is to be disparaged
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.520]   or come against in any way.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.120]   So it seems to me that you're supposed to be able
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.880]   to do anything you want except consent,
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.820]   but I can't even figure out,
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:23:02.220]   I can't figure out even what consent means.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:04.600]   In this sense, I read an article yesterday
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.560]   as I was reading about this.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.400]   I read an article by a guy, I guess he was a cook,
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.480]   'cause he was Eddie Hwang, I think it was.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.680]   And I guess he's a celebrity in the world of cooking.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.000]   And this article, he was talking about a sexual assault
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   that he received when he was a kid,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.880]   he went on a trip with a Baptist church group.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.040]   And while he and a roommate of his
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:34.960]   were in their room, in like the camp room one night,
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.800]   a male camp counselor who was older came in
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:43.800]   and took a shower, came out of the shower naked
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.480]   and stood at the end of their bed,
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.400]   according to his account,
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.920]   stood at the end of their bed for 15 minutes naked
[01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.100]   with an erect penis reading the Bible to them.
[01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.360]   Now, if that's true,
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.440]   and I don't see any reason to doubt his account,
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.720]   number one, that is so utterly
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:07.000]   perishing and shameful that that would happen.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.520]   And unfortunately, it's not hard to believe
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.080]   because it does happen, but it's so shameful
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.640]   that that would happen on a Baptist church group
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.640]   to a boy who doesn't even go to church,
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.520]   who was just coming along 'cause a friend said,
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.040]   "You can come along on this fun church group.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.360]   You don't have to believe anything.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.000]   They'll pressure you a little bit to believe."
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.160]   So it's so shameful, but I thought about that.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:35.080]   And I was just thinking about his story
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.240]   and I asked myself, is that sexual assault?
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:43.200]   Now, it's entirely improper and it shouldn't happen.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.080]   It's entirely immodest, but is it sexual assault?
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.160]   'Cause he's coming out with his Me Too story
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.000]   and talking about how I was assaulted
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.680]   and I pushed the memory back
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.400]   and it's caused me fear and trauma.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.980]   I believe that to be the case,
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.280]   but is that sexual assault?
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.560]   Well, if that's sexual assault,
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.760]   then am I not being sexually assaulted
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.800]   if I'm walking down Bourbon Street in New Orleans
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.680]   and a woman flashes me?
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.520]   Or is it that, wait a second though,
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.960]   because hold on, it's genitalia sexual assault.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.200]   Somebody displaying genitalia,
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   but displaying breasts, that's a matter of feminism, right?
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.000]   Because if men can take their shirt off,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.440]   then women should be able to take their shirt off too
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.100]   in public and so therefore,
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.180]   the flashing of breasts is not sexual assault
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.020]   because of it's above.
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.640]   But what about the women who do body paint
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.420]   and walk down the street in body paint?
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.480]   Is that sexual assault?
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.160]   Because I can, am I being assaulted?
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.160]   Well, I don't think so,
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:47.160]   but I don't even know how to figure out this stuff.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.480]   And after all, if that makes that person happy
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.280]   to expose themselves to me,
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.920]   then on what basis do I wanna deprive them
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.560]   of their happiness and their erotic fulfillment, right?
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.960]   And I thought about this in regards to the age of consent,
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.240]   right, 'cause the allegations against Judge Moore
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:13.240]   are about, the allegations are that he pressed himself,
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.260]   he didn't engage in sexual intercourse,
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.180]   but he fondled a girl who was 14 and pressed himself on her.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.780]   Now, okay, so the problem there,
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:26.140]   is the problem the fondling
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:29.000]   or is the problem the consent or is the problem the age?
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.900]   I can't figure it out.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:32.800]   So now I'm opposed to all of it.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.900]   I've been clear with that,
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.440]   but let's just walk this reasoning through
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.640]   and see where this ends.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.200]   So the basic allegation,
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.400]   the basic horror that I see expressed
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.480]   in our modern culture, modern secular culture,
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.400]   is that it's about the age of consent.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.400]   This was a 14-year-old and allegedly with an older man.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.280]   Okay, I agree.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:57.100]   An older man should not, there should be no sex.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:57.940]   That's the thing.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.860]   My way is much simpler.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.420]   By the way, if I can ever convert you
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.380]   to come and think like I do,
[01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:02.940]   it's much simpler when you just say,
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:07.100]   man, woman, married, great, enjoy sex.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.180]   Man, woman, not married, no sex.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.220]   It's very simple.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:12.660]   I don't believe it just 'cause it's simple,
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.540]   but that's a little simpler way to figure it out.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.500]   So I thought about age of consent and I thought,
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.460]   well, we all agree, right,
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.280]   'cause a 32-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl,
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.720]   there's a power imbalance,
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.240]   and so can a 14-year-old girl accurately give herself,
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.180]   give up control, accurately give herself up sexually
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.820]   to somebody who's 32 years old?
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.820]   Okay, well, I'm with you on that.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.220]   But then the question is,
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:41.220]   is a 14-year-old's judgment questionable?
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.820]   Well, if a 14-year-old's judgment
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:47.180]   about their ability to give consent is questionable,
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.060]   then why are we giving explicit sex education
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.380]   and passing out condoms
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:55.560]   to children younger than 14 years old?
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.800]   If a 14-year-old's judgment is questionable
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.540]   when confronted with a 32-year-old man,
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.660]   does it make it right
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:05.140]   if she actually wants to be with a 32-year-old man?
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.380]   And if it's not right, then why is it not right?
[01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:10.100]   But if her judgment is questionable about consent,
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.460]   then what about some of the other,
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:16.380]   when I was 13 years old, I was a pretty big guy.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.340]   I was a lot bigger than a lot of the girls
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:20.500]   that I interacted with, I always have been.
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:23.620]   So if the age of consent is about fear and intimidation
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.460]   from an older person,
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.020]   then it shouldn't be based on size and coercion.
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.100]   I never had sex when I was 13 years old, thank God.
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.580]   But if I had, then the modern culture would say,
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:36.980]   well, that's okay if you're with a 13-year-old girl.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.700]   But is it really okay if the 14-year,
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.980]   I'm getting mixed up on my age, but you get the idea.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.940]   What does it matter, age of consent?
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.060]   Does it matter among children?
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.940]   And why are we teaching children to have sex,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.620]   but use a condom and have safe sex?
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.460]   And here's how you have anal sex.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:54.060]   So it's just, it's weird.
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.700]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:59.540]   Or is the standard desire,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.380]   the number one biggest driver that I can discern
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:05.380]   from the modern philosophy that is preached to me
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:08.460]   is that whatever I wanna do in consent is fine.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.980]   Okay, then why would it be wrong for an older man
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.340]   who desires a younger girl,
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.180]   and a younger girl who desires an older man
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:18.220]   to have sexual contact if they're giving consent?
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:21.020]   And especially if we consider that a 13-year-old boy
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:24.620]   or girl is at an age with sexual,
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.740]   like they're sexually mature, and yet...
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:32.580]   Anyway, no doubt I've backed myself into a corner here
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.140]   with this final little words.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:38.980]   But it just, this is so utterly destructive.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:41.700]   And we're gonna bear the pain of this
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.060]   for an ongoing period of time.
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.820]   We already are, we've already borne the pain
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:50.180]   of these things so far.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:55.180]   So my plea for you, forgive me if I went off rambling,
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.820]   my plea for you is this.
[01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.180]   Protect yourself because it's morally right.
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:07.740]   And you'll enjoy the benefits of being protected
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.700]   from having your career destroyed with sexual scandal.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:16.380]   Number two, if you see evil around you,
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:20.340]   expose it to the light so that it can be dealt with.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:25.380]   Number three, if there is sin in your past,
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.860]   repent from your sin and make it right.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:31.620]   Go and make it right, repent towards God,
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.580]   and go and perform deeds of repentance
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.060]   towards the people that you have wronged.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:38.980]   'Cause it will come out, and it will come out
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.620]   at the most inconvenient time
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.260]   if you don't deal with it now.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:47.780]   I hope that this has been helpful to you.
[01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   I hope that, I've demonstrated that this does have
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.680]   deep financial impact,
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:01.420]   and which is why I'm placing it here
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.220]   on Radical Personal Finance for you.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:07.180]   And one comment I had recently,
[01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:08.900]   and this'll be my closing thought.
[01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.980]   Probably pretty frequently,
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:17.220]   I set out just to create the show for you,
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:19.220]   and sometimes, a lot of times,
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:23.020]   it seems like when I wind up reading Bible passages to you,
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.420]   I'm dealing with sexuality.
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.880]   I'm gonna change that in the future.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:32.980]   Because one of the things that is so important
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.980]   is that the Bible talks about different sins.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:43.120]   But as an example, in 1 Corinthians 6,
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.600]   let me just read this to you.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.000]   And I've read this before,
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.780]   but I just wanna make one point here
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.920]   with regard to the importance of things like greed
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:54.080]   and covetousness, which deeply impact money.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.040]   Bible says, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.180]   "will not inherit the kingdom of God?
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:01.760]   "Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral,
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:04.940]   "nor idolaters, nor adulterers,
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.520]   "nor men who practice homosexuality,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.040]   "nor thieves, nor the greedy,
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:13.680]   "nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers,
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.920]   "will inherit the kingdom of God.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.320]   "And such were some of you, but you were washed,
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.060]   "you were sanctified, you were justified
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.560]   "in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.240]   "and by the Spirit of our God."
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.760]   My point with reading that is,
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.100]   in our modern kind of like super sexualized culture,
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:30.680]   every time, when I've read that scripture
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:32.240]   in the past one time about drunkenness,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.040]   and I received an email filled with people saying,
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.780]   "Joshua, how could you say that about homosexuals,
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.480]   "men who practice homosexuality?"
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.680]   I just thought, like, I just read the verse.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.640]   But you know what I never hear?
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.680]   I never hear someone that says, "Joshua,
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:49.340]   "how could you say that about thieves?
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.300]   "How could you say that about the greedy?
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:54.020]   "How could you say that about swindlers?"
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:54.860]   Why?
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:58.360]   The reason why is because those battles
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.200]   have been fought in past cultures.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.080]   In the modern United States of America,
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.440]   because of our Christian heritage,
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.000]   every single one of us will rightly stand up
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   and condemn thievery and greediness and swindlers.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.720]   Our laws reflect it, our society reflects it as well.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.860]   It was not always that way.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:27.560]   That has been some hard work by people that came before
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.040]   to convert past cultures and to establish
[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.920]   upright standards of righteousness and justice
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.440]   as related to swindling and thieves and greedy people.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:44.480]   But today, our discussion somehow seems to be
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:49.480]   related to sex and homosexuality and sexual immorality
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:52.000]   and all of this stuff.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.840]   Now, my price for sharing this show with you
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:00.080]   is going to be an email filled with angry listeners.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.120]   I feel I've satisfied my conscience
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.760]   by giving you a fair warning up front.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:06.760]   You're voluntarily choosing to listen to
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:11.100]   a freely offered audio file.
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.080]   But I want to just make one comment to you.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:20.080]   I don't actually think much, personally,
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:22.120]   about sexual matters.
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.800]   I'm married, I have a beautiful wife,
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:28.100]   I enjoy sex with my wife, and I'm happy
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:29.920]   to basically ignore everything else
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.160]   and just focus on my wife and my children and my own life.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.660]   Pretty happy to do that.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:38.800]   I'm not the one bringing this stuff up.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.200]   And I think I'm just speaking here,
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.960]   if you wonder why, and we often get the questions,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:47.560]   Christians, why do you Christians talk about sex so much?
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.720]   I didn't put sex on the front page of the newspaper.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:51.840]   I am putting it here, obviously.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:54.260]   It was one episode out of 500 or whatever
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.080]   on Radical Personal Finance.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.160]   But I didn't put it on the front page of the newspaper.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.200]   But whatever's there, we gotta deal with.
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:04.640]   Thank you very much for listening.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.840]   I hope that you've sensed, just my heart for you,
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.080]   my desire to, together, see justice accomplished,
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:18.080]   see victims exonerated, to see the immoral
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.300]   and the sinners and the criminals face
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.400]   the proper judgment for their behavior,
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:28.600]   and to see, collectively, to see us move forward
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.080]   into lives filled with justice and with peace on all sides,
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:37.320]   where people are protected from predators
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.160]   and where people are honored for the,
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:47.080]   I can't do anything but use the language,
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.840]   the Christian language, the Bible language,
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.520]   because it's the only thing that connects these things.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   I wanna see you honored as an image-bearer of God.
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.200]   And I wanna see your worth protected and respected,
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.960]   and to see you honored and lifted up in dignity.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.880]   That's what I wanna see.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.840]   Thank you for listening.
