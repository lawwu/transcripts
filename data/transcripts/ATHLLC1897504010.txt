[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.240]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.940]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.280]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have you on my journey to optimize life,
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.620]   to maximize happiness and to do it all while spending less and saving more.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300]   So today I'm sharing the second half of my conversation with Brandon Turner.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.600]   If you didn't listen two weeks ago, Brandon has had an incredible career
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.760]   in real estate, and that episode covered so many different aspects of the topic.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.600]   Well, not unsurprisingly, successful people often have more than one area
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000]   in their life that others can learn a lot from.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.080]   And after we finished up talking real estate, we covered so much more
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.640]   like setting goals, hacking self-discipline, using performance coaches,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.160]   finding the balance between audacious business goals and quality family time
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.160]   and the mindset Brandon used to build a massive real estate empire
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.360]   while also living his ideal life.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.440]   Oh, and since he lives in Maui, I also got his recommendations
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.760]   for your next trip there, some of which I actually took on the trip.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.400]   We just got back from.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.640]   So let's get into the rest of my conversation with Brandon Turner.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.740]   Brandon, welcome back.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.440]   I want to dive right into mindset and systems
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.940]   because you've talked about that in our last conversation.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.120]   You've talked about it a lot in the past.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.160]   What are most people getting wrong when it comes to their mindset
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.080]   and the systems they put around it?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.820]   This might not be true for this audience, right?
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.520]   Because if you're listening to this show,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.020]   like you're probably already a pretty high achiever.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.120]   You've got goals, you've got things you want to do in life.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.100]   But I'll say that most people live life in the backseat.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100]   They're being driven around in this crazy taxi around the world
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.400]   and they're just doing whatever comes at them.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.740]   They're not taking any control.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.300]   So I would say 90% of the world is that way.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.840]   They have no mindset because they don't know that's a thing.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.640]   They don't know that there's a thing they should be concerned about.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.080]   Like they work the same job.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.980]   They hate and they're miserable for 50 years.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.580]   And they just look forward to the weekends
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.180]   where they can drink with their buddies, because that's just what life is.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.820]   So assuming that these people are not that type, what are they getting?
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.780]   And it's related, right?
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020]   It's knowing that anything is possible.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.120]   Anything is possible.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.720]   It's like your mom said when you were a little kid, right?
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.260]   You can do anything if you try.
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.440]   Like, it's totally true, right? You could do anything.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.800]   You could make millions in real estate.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.840]   You could build a tech company.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.500]   You could be a digital nomad and live on points and 500 bucks a month or whatever.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.340]   Like you could do whatever you want.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.540]   So I'm a big believer of like, start with a feeling of life you want to have.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.820]   Define your ideal day.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.680]   Like, I love that practice.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.020]   We're just like, what is the ideal perfect day look like?
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.380]   And then jot that down.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.980]   And now you know where you're headed.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.180]   Now you can find the strategy that's going to get you there.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.420]   But the mindset of this, like I want an ideal life and an ideal life
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.820]   is possible for me.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.760]   So I'm going to pursue it with every ounce of my being.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.740]   And almost everybody I know who is incredibly happy in life
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.900]   and incredibly successful, not just for money, but from anything, right?
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.400]   People I know who have an amazing marriage.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.100]   It's because they know that having an amazing marriage is possible
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.300]   and they work for it and they fight for it because they know it's possible.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.380]   And so that's the thing.
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.440]   I think a lot of people in general miss is they never take time to envision
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.580]   what's possible and they just do what's ever in front of them.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.780]   I'm going to assume you're one of those people that wants an amazing marriage.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.460]   You know, tell me about things that you've done intentionally to make that possible.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.060]   So I set goals every year.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.100]   This is one of those life changing things I ever did.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.540]   My wife and I, every year on the first or maybe the second,
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.000]   whenever we get a babysitter, we will go out and spend like half a day
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.780]   or maybe even a full day doing our couple's goal setting retreat.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.440]   Now, in a perfect world, I'd go for like two or three days,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.640]   go to the mountains or whatever.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.180]   And I got little kids at home.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.240]   I got a two year old and six year old.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.320]   So right now that's not happening, but we'll get out for a day
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.080]   and we will just work together
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.420]   on where we want to be as a couple.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.520]   And that starts with a reflection on your past.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   Like, where were we last year? Where do we struggle?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.960]   What are we doing right? What are we doing wrong?
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.460]   And then where do we want to be?
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.460]   So five years ago, we said within five years, we wanted a house in Hawaii.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.160]   We wanted a house where we could have people come and visit.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.600]   Family and friends to come and stay with us.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   I said I wanted to surf more.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.300]   I had all this stuff we want to do as a couple.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.480]   And it wasn't five years later.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.980]   We did it like nine months later, because as soon as we defined
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.340]   what was possible and we had a goal, all of a sudden I was like, well,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.360]   hey, you want to go to Hawaii for a couple of months this winter
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.020]   while it's miserable and rainy in the Pacific Northwest? Sure.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.980]   So we went there.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.960]   And because we knew we wanted to end up there someday,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.060]   we started looking at real estate and all of a sudden we found a house.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.500]   Right. Is that law of attraction?
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.000]   I mean, is that stuff or is that we had a vision for where we wanted to go
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and we work towards it. So we do that in our marriage.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.640]   We set goals together every year.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.740]   We visit them every quarter.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.200]   I have a sheet hung up on my bathroom mirror
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.340]   that has our goals for the year, as well as spots for checking off.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.080]   And I'm not very good at checking, honestly, with this.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.380]   I wish I checked it every single day.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.780]   All the habits that are going to give us a better marriage.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.760]   But we at least have it in the mirror every single day
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.180]   when I open up for like my toothbrush.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.460]   And so just being intentional, again, doing the things that we do in business
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.920]   and applying them to our personal life,
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.400]   that has made such a difference on the relationship side.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.200]   Do you do the same thing for other goals in life,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   whether it's business goals or your own personal nonrelationship goals?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.140]   Yes, very similar.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.100]   So I have a journal called The Intention Journal,
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.880]   and I basically just got everybody like journal in the world,
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.240]   every goal journal there was.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.980]   And I used all of them for a while over the course of like three years.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.380]   And then I just made my own.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.740]   But I'm not saying you have to get that one.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.120]   I'm going to give you a really simple system that I used.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.680]   So I have a vision for what my life to head.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.060]   Right. I have longer term goals.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.620]   Like I'm trying to buy $10 billion of real estate in 10 years.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.220]   That's just so far out there, though.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.220]   So I don't like thinking in terms of like decade goals,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220]   even though I might have them.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.200]   I don't like thinking in terms of even like three year goals,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.340]   even though I have them, even one year goals.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.700]   I don't love that much.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.800]   It's just too far away.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.500]   So what I like to do is I like to do quarterly or 90 day goals.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.200]   There's a great book out there called The 12 Week Year,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.940]   where I get a lot of this from The 12 Week Year by Brian Moran,
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.040]   I think is the guy's name.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.180]   So the idea is like every quarter I set three goals for myself.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.280]   I say, what are the three things this quarter I want to do?
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.580]   Typically, it's one relational goal.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.020]   Usually it's a fitness goal and usually it's a business goal.
[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.080]   For example, this quarter, one of my goals was simply to close
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.400]   the six apartment complexes we had under contract.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.500]   By the end of the quarter, I want to be able to close those and raise the money.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.560]   And there's a lot of things that go into that.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.700]   But that's the idea.
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.860]   So now I've got my three goals written out.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.060]   In fact, one of my goals for the last quarter of the year
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060]   is going to be to spend three days without the kids.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.260]   That's a weird goal, right?
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.700]   But that's the relationship one.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.800]   My wife and I have not had a night alone without the kids in six years.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.400]   Like since Rosie was born, we have not actually had a vacation
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.040]   where somebody watched Rosie. Yeah.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.580]   And I'm like, this is a long time.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.220]   So now the kids like the youngest is no longer breastfeeding.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.080]   He's eating on his own.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.720]   He's a big kid now, two years old.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.620]   Now we can do it.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.280]   So I have the goal for the quarter every Sunday night, every single Sunday night.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.260]   And again, if I miss it, I'll do Monday morning.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.600]   I sit down and I rewrite what those three goals are.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.720]   I write, what is the purpose for the goal?
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.660]   I write that every week. Why do I want that goal?
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.440]   It just reminds me, it gets me back into the right mentality of like,
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.100]   what am I doing all this for?
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.040]   Then I write down what is my weekly goal?
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.240]   Like to be on track for my quarterly goal, what's the weekly goal?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.980]   So I write the weekly goal down.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.340]   Then I was right.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.480]   What's my most important next step?
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.780]   Like the smallest tangible thing I can do to accomplish my weekly goal.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.920]   So let's say my weekly goal is to hire a new assistant.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   OK, well, what's the most important next step on that?
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.260]   Well, I guess I got to put a job application out there.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.800]   Nope, not good enough. Go deeper.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.700]   I need to open up my computer and write a job description.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.840]   Can I go even more specific?
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.640]   I need to go to Google and Google assistant job descriptions.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.100]   So now what I've actually done here and just in the past three minutes
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.180]   of rambling here, I took a 10 year vision.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.200]   I went from 10 years to three to one to 90 days or, you know, a quarter
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.120]   down to a week, down to a day, down to an action.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.620]   And every single morning I wake up and do the same thing.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.920]   So every morning of the week, I just wake up and I say,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.380]   what is my most important step to accomplish the weekly goal every day?
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.120]   So I've taken a 10 year goal of buying $10 billion of real estate,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.400]   and I've boiled the entire thing down to a 30 second task.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.300]   Go to Google and type in personal assistant job description and hit enter.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.100]   My entire future, my family's future,
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.300]   my generational wealth is all dependent on a 30 second Google search.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.080]   And then I do it and then I can do it again five minutes after that.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.340]   And so that's my entire goal setting process.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.580]   And I just bake it inside my journal. But yeah, that's it.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.120]   Is there a way you structure your day or your workflow to be more productive?
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.820]   I have a personal assistant,
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.760]   so she makes me do a lot of things that are important.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.900]   Let's talk about hacking real quick.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.800]   The idea of like credit card hacking or travel hacking or, you know, house hacking.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.600]   Let's talk about self-discipline hacking.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.700]   I have zero self-discipline, almost none.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.040]   Like if there's a cookie on the counter, I will eat it.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.500]   If there is a meeting I can skip, I will skip it.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.340]   If there is anything I need to do, I will let myself down.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.380]   I will lie to myself. I will disappoint myself all day long.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.480]   As a result, I'm really bad at getting things done.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.380]   So I've had to hack my way into being productive and being efficient.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.380]   I'll give you a couple examples. One, I hire a personal assistant.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.720]   So Jane, who's my assistant right now, Jane's awesome.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.060]   Jane makes sure that I do the most important things and will yell at me.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.860]   And I tell her that she has permission to like force me to do things.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.240]   And there's ways to do it right.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.100]   For example, I get a massage once a week.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.140]   I don't get a massage because it feels good.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.400]   I mean, yes, it feels good, right? Like massages are fun.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.300]   I get a massage because I know the most important thing
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.180]   as an entrepreneur that I can do is have uninterrupted
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.340]   thinking time every week, but I don't do it like I won't do it.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.120]   I will write that. I'll put on my calendar.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.620]   Go sit at the beach and go think for an hour and a half or just process journal.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.460]   I won't do it because I lie to myself and I disappoint myself all the time.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.560]   But when Adriana, my Brazilian masseuse, shows up in my driveway
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.900]   and she's pulling behind this giant massage chair.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.400]   Well, now I'm going to do it, right?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.540]   Because I've now obligated myself to somebody else.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.840]   So then I go and get an hour and a half long massage.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.120]   And most of the best ideas and problem solving I've had are during that massage.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.380]   So a massage is simply a way that I have hacked my lack of self-discipline
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.320]   to do the things that I want to do.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.720]   I hire a personal trainer to come to my house to work out.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   I do the food thing.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.980]   Like you said, I have somebody now helping with the kids
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:09.920]   so that I can do other things.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.220]   I align my life so that way I am obligated to do the things
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.600]   that I know I need to do, but lack the self-discipline to get it done.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.400]   I even have accountability groups like mastermind groups
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.340]   that we meet every week and go through our goals.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.340]   All this is designed to get me to just do something because I'm so darn lazy.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.140]   Let me just throw a couple more ideas in case people are interested
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.480]   in more ways they can kind of hack their laziness or their self-discipline.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.420]   One of them, I am a big believer in checking boxes.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.120]   Seinfeld has this quote from years ago.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.820]   It's probably made up.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.060]   It's probably one of those like Abe Lincoln said it kind of things, but
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.960]   where he said every day he writes one joke.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.860]   And when he's done with the joke, he puts a big checkmark
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.340]   on like a spreadsheet or something like that.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.860]   And after a while, you start getting a lot of checkmarks in a row.
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.740]   And so his advice to this up and coming comedian he gave was
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.040]   don't break the chain of checkmarks.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.440]   Just don't break the chain.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.280]   So I'm a bigger believer of doing little tiny actions
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.420]   over and over and over and over and then putting them on a checklist.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.580]   Like that's why I said I have a checklist inside my bathroom
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.520]   mirror for some of our relationship habits.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.380]   But I do it in my journal every single morning.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.420]   So, for example, like read one page.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.460]   I can read one page or I'm really bad at flossing, right?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.820]   So I'll be like, I'm going to floss.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.540]   These are things now I'm not good at it, but because I'm tracking it now
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.640]   and because I have an accountability group that looks at my tracking,
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.440]   I would look stupid if I showed up and was like, yeah, well,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.580]   I said I was going to eat healthy all week, but I just ate, you know,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.380]   Cheetos and Mai Tais all week.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.240]   Like I would just look stupid
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.920]   because I don't want to disappoint my accountability buddies
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.960]   like the other guys that are like, hey, we're going to build our businesses, too.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.680]   So I don't want to look bad in front of other people.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.400]   So I will then get that accountability around them.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.220]   In fact, in my own company, I operate a system called EOS.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.360]   Have you read Traction?
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.760]   Gina Wickman's Traction.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.540]   So Gina Wickman has a book called Traction.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.540]   Get a grip on your business.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.780]   It's basically a system for pulling all the different pieces
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.080]   of your business together into one cohesive system.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.680]   It's kind of like what I said earlier with the goals.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.780]   You have your big 10 year goal, maybe in a three year goal,
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.340]   and you track it down to a meeting that you have once a week with your team.
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.220]   But in that meeting, I say out loud in that meeting,
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:20.400]   like last week, I said I would do blank and I blank.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.920]   Last week, I said I would call three investors.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.860]   I called two.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.300]   In other words, I have to fail.
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.260]   I have to publicly fail in front of my team
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.000]   if I don't deliver on the thing I said I was going to do.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.480]   So by adding in that piece of the meeting through the book Traction,
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.980]   again, we operate on this kind of system.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.480]   But that piece of the meeting is I said I would do this.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.880]   I did this.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.640]   That holds me accountable because although I will let myself down,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.280]   I don't want to let my team down.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.420]   I don't want to let them down.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.120]   So the more I can obligate myself to things,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.420]   the more likely the things get done.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.060]   I mean, at the end of the day,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.920]   you are the results of what you repeatedly do.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.720]   Let me say that again, because this is like one of the most profound statements.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.560]   I didn't invent it.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.820]   I've heard it said in many different times in many different ways.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.500]   You get the results of what you repeatedly do.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.420]   You eat chips and nachos and Mai Tais every day.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.960]   You're going to get overweight.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.200]   You jog every single day.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.700]   You're going to lose weight.
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.940]   You spend 15 minutes every day
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.740]   looking into your significant other's eyes, having a real conversation.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.440]   You're going to have a better relationship.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.540]   You avoid them. You're going to have a bad one, right?
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.580]   There are certain things in life that give us the result of life that we want.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.680]   So all we need to do to be successful in anything,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.320]   I really believe this is like know where you want to go,
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   know what things are going to get you there.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.880]   And when I say things, I mean the habits, the traits, the systems, whatever.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.560]   Track those things and get accountability on it.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.020]   If it's a group of guys getting accountability together,
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.940]   you know, guys meaning guys or girls, is it hiring a performance coach?
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.660]   Whatever that is, get the accountability.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.300]   You should know where you're going.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.440]   Figure out what the steps are needed to get there.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.640]   Track it so you can be aware of you getting there and not getting there
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.480]   and then get accountability so you can hack your self-discipline.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.580]   You can accomplish anything, anything by doing that.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.320]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.780]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.920]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.020]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.760]   and I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.360]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.160]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.140]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.240]   It tastes so good when it's cold.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.680]   And I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day,
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.020]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.820]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.680]   minerals and superfoods and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.860]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial anything.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.620]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.260]   a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.400]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.920]   daily nutritional insurance.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.320]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.820]   jump on your new couch naked during potty training or the indescribable pain
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.060]   of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs in your bare feet,
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.160]   both of which happened to me recently.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.300]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance,
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.700]   especially when you do it with Fabric, who I'm excited to partner
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:40.900]   with for this episode.

[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.060]   Not available in certain states.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.660]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.560]   So you've got your group of accountability partners,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.400]   you've got your spouse, you've got your team, you've got all these systems,
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.300]   but you also have a performance coach.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.400]   Tell me about what that brings to the table.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.400]   It's like therapy.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.600]   It's literally just like it's like
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.780]   once a week, somebody asked me a bunch of hard questions
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.440]   that I have to answer them and think deeper.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.620]   So just like the massage time is forcing me to have that unstructured,
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.380]   just open, like thinking time,
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.920]   the performance time is forced time to work on my business,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.360]   not in my business, to work on my life and not in my life.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.960]   So my coach, his name is Jason Dries.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.120]   It's like trees with a D at the end, Dries.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   He's like he'll ask me just very simple questions like,
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.620]   where are you not playing fully out right now?
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.920]   Or is that really what you want or is that what you're expected to say?
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.860]   Right. Very like therapy type questions, usually around my business.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.400]   So we get into a lot more than just business.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.740]   But it's just a time every week that I'm forced to
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.380]   look at my business like an outsider,
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.580]   to look at my life like an outsider and to say, like, what can I do better?
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.640]   How can I improve this?
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.620]   A performance coach is something I believe every single human should have
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.820]   if you can afford it.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.020]   And if you can't afford it, then get a group of people together
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.460]   and do the same thing, just do it for free with a group of people.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.220]   It's not as powerful because you're not paying somebody.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   So there's no bias for action on their part to actually hold you accountable.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.500]   But if you can pay someone to ask those tough questions,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.640]   how does that not pay off a hundredfold?
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.600]   Even if only 10% of the calls I do with Jason are effective,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.100]   the one out of 10 will completely transform my life. Right.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.300]   In fact, I left the Bigger Pockets podcast after 10 years.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.540]   It all started with a question he asked me.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.140]   He just said, it sounds like you're getting kind of burned out.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.080]   You need to take a month off.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.140]   How's that sit with you?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.980]   Does that feel light or does that feel heavy?
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.820]   And I'm like, a month off sounds amazing.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.560]   I'm going to do it. I'm going to take a month off.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.620]   I had never taken time off the podcast.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.000]   And that one question led to taking a month off, which then once
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.560]   I had decided that was OK to take a month off, I was like, wait,
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.160]   why don't I just take the whole thing off?
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.740]   Why don't I just stop?
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.400]   Why don't I just focus on the other part of my business?
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.900]   So having that person who just dives into your psyche
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.740]   and asks you good questions always pays off.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.100]   I believe it always.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.280]   Where would you tell someone who believes you?
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.540]   They're like, great, I need one.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.820]   Where do they go to find a performance coach?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.720]   It's tough, man.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.240]   I mean, you can go to the big organizations
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.360]   like the Tony Robbins or whatever, and there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.180]   I like my guy.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.060]   I got it from a referral in Jason Dries.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.180]   I think it's the Jason Dries coaching.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.460]   He's got a bunch of people under him.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460]   Like those are like the big ones.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.920]   There's a company called Strategic Coach with Dan Sullivan.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.200]   In fact, the reason I thought of it, his name is on the front of the traction book.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.460]   He's a coach that helps people.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.540]   I think just knowing that you need that and then just talking to people
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.240]   and putting it out there and just like hiring an employee.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.940]   Let's go back to that previous conversation we have.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.200]   It's really easy to find a performance coach.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.340]   It's really hard to find a good performance coach
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.680]   that's going to hold you accountable and such.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.280]   I always think someday it would be fun to own a performance coaching company.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.580]   I don't own one now, but it'd be kind of fun to do so
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.820]   because I believe so strongly in it.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.220]   So I don't know. Do you have a recommendation?
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.360]   Let's fire it back at you.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.280]   I don't know if I have a recommendation of where to find someone,
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.360]   but I think something different between an employee and a coach
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.960]   is that there are a lot of very good coaches we talked about.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.320]   It's hard to find a good employee.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.700]   There are a lot of very good coaches that might be very not good for you.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.660]   And so I think when you hire employees, you're like, is this employee bad?
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.500]   And you're like, yeah, they are. I got to let them go.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.900]   A lot of times this has happened to me.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.920]   I had the highest recommended executive CEO coach when I was a founder.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.120]   Every single person I knew loved this person.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.020]   And as a friend, I love this person.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.260]   But for me, they weren't actually the best coach.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.460]   And it took me a long time to figure that out because I was so caught up
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.320]   in the fact that everyone said they were a great coach.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.660]   Everyone said they're amazing.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.600]   So like something must be wrong with me if I'm not getting the most out of this.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.460]   I think when it comes to coaching, when it comes to therapy,
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.060]   I think it's important to realize that there are people
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.140]   that are really good at their job that might not be really good working with you.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.640]   And so you might have to experiment.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.440]   You might have to try a handful of coaches
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.680]   till you find the one that pushes you in the right way.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.480]   And all of them might be good.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.880]   So don't assume that because someone's good, they're good for you.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.920]   That would be my advice.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.820]   That is phenomenal advice, right?
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.380]   Because there's also different types of coaches, right?
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.160]   You might not need the guy who's going to be like,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.660]   you need to get to 10 extra business, you know, grow, grow, grow.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.220]   Like you might need like, hey, you need to slow down and go be a father
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.920]   for a little bit.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.460]   Different coaches are going to push you in different ways.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.500]   Then there's also like the coaches that are like,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.160]   they're going to teach you how to do a certain task.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.100]   And then the coaches that are more like a therapy,
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.240]   they're going to go wherever direction you want to go.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.340]   Just trying out a bunch of them, trying to find what fits.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.000]   They're out there.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.540]   And if you know that's what you need, just pursue it.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.040]   Put it out there in the universe again.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.380]   Law of attraction, quote unquote, or just knowing what you want
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.120]   and then relentlessly pursuing it.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   You're going to find somebody great and then you're going to transform your life.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.220]   I really believe that.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.060]   So I want to get to family.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.360]   But first, can you talk about the Starbucks strategy?
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.960]   We talked about a bunch of strategies.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.400]   This is one that I've seen you talk about when it comes to big tasks.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.600]   Let's hear about it.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.120]   So Starbucks strategy looks like this.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.560]   I call it that just because this is how I've written my books.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.900]   I've written like five books, right?
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.200]   The first book I wrote was called
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.740]   The Book on Investing in Real Estate with No and Low Money Down.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.200]   Longest title ever.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.600]   And I wrote that like, I'm going to write a book.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.800]   So I sat down one day and I started writing some words
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.080]   and then I put it away for a few weeks.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.540]   I came back and I wrote a few more words and I put it away for a few weeks.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.020]   And when I was inspired, I wrote some words.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.560]   That book was hell to write.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.320]   It took me over a year to write it.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.620]   I hated every second of it.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.620]   I did not enjoy writing it.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.320]   It turned out fine.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:08.820]   The book's fine.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.120]   You should read it if you have no money because it's a book for no money.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.720]   Then the second time I was like, I don't want to do that again,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.060]   but I need to write this other book on rental property investing.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.500]   So that time I said, I'm going to pursue this differently.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.340]   First of all, I'm going to learn how other people write nonfiction books.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.040]   And I studied a lot.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.900]   And so this whole strategy comes from a bunch of other people.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.700]   I didn't make this up.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.840]   I don't make up anything.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.380]   I just regurgitate stuff.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.940]   So I go to Starbucks with my wife.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.840]   Actually, she was going to write a book at the same time.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.080]   She was going to write it on managing.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   I was going to write it on just investing in rentals.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.320]   And we sat down at a Starbucks and we made a commitment to ourselves
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.220]   and said, we will not leave the Starbucks until our book is 100% perfectly outlined.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.980]   It's really that quote, like the Abe Lincoln quote.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.100]   Again, who knows if he said it?
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.360]   But he said, if I had six hours to chop down a tree,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.400]   I would spend the first four sharpening my axe.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.100]   So what this whole strategy was, was like, I'm going to spend a focused,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.480]   dedicated, nonstop period of time to sharpen the axe.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   So for me, I sat down, I spec'd out the entire book on note cards.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.020]   It was like 12 chapters, 12 sub chapters.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.980]   Flip every card over and had an outline of what that sub chapter is going to be about.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.020]   So at the end of the day now, every day after that, I ended up like 100 note cards.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.920]   I think actually when I was done every day, I had a note card for 100 days
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.560]   straight with what chapter it's in, what the sub chapter is,
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.340]   and then three or four or five bullet points and what I had to write.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.660]   Well, that's easy.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.140]   Now I just got to write 500 words to 1000 words a day.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:37.100]   And within exactly 100 days later, my wife and I both finished a book
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.380]   and we had two full books.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.780]   Total length was almost 300000 words between the two.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.180]   And yeah, sold over a million copies of those books.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.520]   Now, all I'm getting at here is like sharpen your axe to find
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.220]   what success is going to look like.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.060]   Do the work up front and it makes everything else easier on the back end.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.780]   So you talked about family.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.500]   I think that there are very few people in the world who would say
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.100]   one of my big goals is to do anything measured in billions, right?
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.800]   You mentioned $10 billion of real estate.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.500]   Most of the people I know that really, really prioritize
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.040]   crazy, audacious business goals
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.700]   don't often talk also about prioritizing being a good partner
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.080]   and being a good parent and having listened to you talk a lot.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.320]   It's something you do more than most.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.880]   How do you find that balance?
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.020]   So first of all, I got into real estate.
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.660]   I got into financial freedom.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.820]   The pursuit of financial independence.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.980]   And I know it's kind of a buzzword, but all I'm talking about is
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.700]   when I say financial independence, the ability to do what you want,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.200]   where you want, when you want, how you want with whomever you want.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.800]   It's just that freedom, right?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.260]   That comes with having money.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.860]   It was never about getting rich, never about being a billionaire
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.740]   or anything like that, right?
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.080]   I wanted to pursue financial independence for two reasons.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.100]   And I think both of these will resonate with you, right?
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.620]   Number one, when I was growing up, like my dad worked really hard,
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.980]   but he wasn't there much because he worked all the time.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.340]   So I rarely saw him.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.520]   And I said, when I am a father someday,
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.380]   I want to be there for every ball game, every ballet recital,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.980]   you know, every field trip.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.320]   I want to be there with my kids.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.660]   I want to be the best father I can possibly be.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.420]   And I can't work 40, 50, 60 hours a week
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.860]   and have commuting to be able to do that.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.420]   So I started with that. And that was the one thing.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.960]   The second thing I said,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.160]   I heard a quote once said the world is a book.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.400]   And those who don't travel read just a page.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.740]   Like the world is so amazing, right?
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.940]   So big and there's so many things to see out there.
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.920]   And I wanted to see as much of it as I can while we're here on this earth.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.380]   And I knew that, again, being broke and working 40, 50 hours a week
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.580]   and getting my two weeks paid vacation every year, that wasn't going to cut it.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.960]   So combining those two things,
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.060]   that's why I pursued real estate and business and wealth in general.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.300]   Now, fast forward a few years.
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.260]   I mean, I've achieved it.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.700]   I could retire right now and just sit on a beach and do nothing,
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.460]   but I'd be bored out of my mind, right?
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.900]   I can only play Barbies and GI Joes for so many hours a day.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.480]   So there's this balance that you have to have.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.600]   And there is no to quote Gary Keller in the one thing.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.840]   There is no such thing as work life balance.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   It's work life balancing.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.420]   It's a constant influx of flow
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.820]   that you sometimes have to go farther one way
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.420]   and sometimes you have to go farther the other.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.260]   And therefore, I am constantly reevaluating
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.260]   where I am on that spectrum of too much work and maybe too much family.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.740]   Right. Because as an entrepreneur, too, we get paid in the future
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.840]   for the work we do today.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.540]   We don't get paid today for the work we do today. Right.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.400]   So we have to do the work now to get paid five years from now.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.240]   We got to plant the seeds today in order to harvest then.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.440]   But I also need to make sure that my kids are being brought up right
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.680]   and that they're connected with me and that we have that solid relationship.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.020]   So I guess that's why I talk about it a lot, because I'm very scared.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.780]   Is that the wrong word?
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.580]   Maybe I'm very concerned that at the end of my life, I will look back and say,
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.200]   why did I work so much?
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.820]   Why didn't I do the things that are most important in life?
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.760]   And the only way to know that is to continue to evaluate it
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.660]   and to have the conversation with people.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.440]   So I love when this topic comes up because it forces me
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.340]   to introspectively look at my life and say, how am I doing right now?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.780]   Like, can I do better? Can I get more balance?
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.220]   What about you? What's your thoughts on it?
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.920]   I used to be someone I still am someone who really loves productivity,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.720]   like inbox zero kind of everything.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.060]   But one thing that I recently picked up.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.480]   So we have two daughters, two and three months.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.920]   So still. Oh, yeah, you're in it. You're in it.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:30.700]   I always wanted to get to inbox zero, but I've lately still prioritized.
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.400]   Right. When I'm working, I'm working in the most efficient manner.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.800]   But when I get to the end of the day and it's actually nice
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.740]   that sometimes kids just force this, right?
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.800]   Like we have an au pair.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.700]   She's done a 530 like there's no real option.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.940]   Like you got to be there at 530.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.040]   I just kind of like let it drop.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.440]   And I think I've spent so much time in my life feeling like, gosh,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.080]   everything I do today is for the future. I need to get it all done.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.080]   I need to get all done.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.780]   And then the next morning, I'm like,
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.880]   well, it didn't really matter that I got everything done before I went to bed.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.860]   Now, there are times Tuesday night, this show comes out on Wednesday mornings.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.900]   Like there are times where it's like, no, I do have to stay up
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.520]   because this thing comes out this time.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.600]   But for the most part, there are a lot of things that you feel
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.840]   a lot of pressure to do.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.500]   And I found that the more I've built the muscle of getting comfortable
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.740]   with not doing some things, whether it's a task at hand
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.580]   or it's just saying no to a meeting, the more you get comfortable with it,
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.620]   the more one it's easier and two, you realize it doesn't matter.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.680]   So, yeah, I remember I got this email from a guy named James Bechara
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.580]   who has a podcast called Below the Line.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.860]   We'd connected in the past and it'd been a few years.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.520]   I reached back out to him and he said, you know what?
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.680]   I don't really want to do meetings
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.760]   because I'm trying to prioritize other things in my life,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.660]   but I'm really down with asynchronous communication.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.360]   So if you want, you could go and use a tool like Loom
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.300]   and you could record a conversation you want to have part of it.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.640]   And then I'd be glad to get back to you.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.900]   And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.840]   So one, it really raised the bar.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.480]   Like, I'm not going to go record a video to talk to him to just shoot the breeze.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.940]   So like he's basically filtering for if you just want to have a BS
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.840]   conversation and talk, that's gone.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.320]   And at the time, I wanted to catch up with him because I was trying
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.860]   to start a podcast, but I didn't really have my questions formulated.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.220]   And it actually forced me to wait and ask when the time was right.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.020]   And then I started using that.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.720]   And boy, it makes everything so much more efficient.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.100]   And it's just helped me prioritize.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.400]   So someone says, hey, you've started companies.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.200]   Can you help me figure out how to start a company in the space that you did?
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.940]   I say, great.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.940]   If you want to go to Loom and you want to record some specific questions
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.480]   or write them out in an email, I'm happy to answer those questions.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.540]   And if it eventually makes sense for us to chat, I'm happy to.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.080]   But there's a lot going on right now, and I just have to let some things drop.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.980]   And it's nothing personal.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.420]   And learning to do that and getting comfortable
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.700]   doing that has made it so much more comfortable to go and say,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.560]   you know what, like this week, our au pair is out of town.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.160]   She's in Boston, New York, Chicago, having a blast.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.640]   And that means there's no child care and two kids is a lot.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.380]   So other than this interview, I basically have no meetings all week.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.540]   And I'm OK with that.
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.420]   And I'm letting things drop because I've gotten comfortable with that skill.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.140]   That's been the biggest thing for me, is that comfort with doing something
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:13.620]   that in your grindy kind of 20s, early 30s time of life just felt unfathomable.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.880]   It's like, I got to get it done.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.520]   Letting it go is very cathartic.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.000]   That reminds me.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.700]   And I love you say like, you know, you got to as soon as you got to drop some stuff
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.160]   right in the book, the one thing I'll bring it up again, Gary Keller, Jay Papasan.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.740]   They have the book, The One Thing and the metaphor in there
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.360]   that says that life is like juggling a bunch of balls, right?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.300]   You're juggling family, health, your work, your career, your financial life.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   You're balancing all those things.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.640]   And he says some of those balls are rubber and some of them are glass.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.780]   Right. When you drop something at work, it'll bounce right back.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:50.080]   Like typically nothing's really that bad, but there are glass balls in our life.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   Right. Our relationship with our spouse or significant other is a glass ball.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.760]   And you can only drop that so many times before it shatters.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.460]   And so I'm always thinking a lot of my life is going to get dropped.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.920]   A lot of things are going to get dropped.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.060]   Let's make sure we drop the right things.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.240]   And that at the end of my life, like that would be a great reputation to have
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.440]   and a great like dying thought is I drop the right balls throughout my life.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.040]   So that's what I'm aiming for.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.080]   And it's funny because I respected the email I got from James so much.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.540]   I've had a handful of people
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.660]   that I would put in the category of like important people.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.580]   Their emails are like, hey, I'm not checking email this summer.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.760]   And I'm like, yeah, damn, that person's like they've got it figured out.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.000]   I didn't write back and be like, that person's an asshole.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.100]   My reaction was like this person is prioritizing their life,
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.060]   in many cases, better than me.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.380]   And so I would just encourage people to realize that most of people's reaction
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.440]   to your dropping the ball in a polite way might actually be
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.480]   kind of jealousy and envy more than frustration.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.320]   Another reason to do that by adding these bounds in your life,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.420]   for example, I'm building a billion dollar brand.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.420]   I have a billion dollars of real estate.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.760]   We'll buy 10 billion.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.560]   That should make my company about a billion in profit over the next five to 10 years.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.600]   It's a legit like billion dollar profit business.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.240]   And I work at most five hours a week.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.300]   Like, that's it.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.900]   Like, I don't work a lot of hours at this.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.000]   I'm going to launch a new business next year that I think is going to be awesome.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.880]   And from day one, I have the requirement.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.980]   I do not work more than five hours a week at this.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.580]   And the cool thing is, is by having those boundaries,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.260]   I am forced to build a business that I am not within.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.460]   Like, I am building it from the outside looking in.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.680]   I'm not building it from the inside up.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.960]   I'm not doing every single role.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.600]   I'm saying, no, that's the rules of this business or this game.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.460]   I'm going to play within the rules.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.500]   And so many people don't realize that you get to make whatever rules you want.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.640]   This is your game, like your business is your game.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.660]   Make it however you want.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.580]   So establish rules like I only work this much.
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.700]   I don't work Fridays.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.440]   I take Wednesday and Thursday and Friday off.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.400]   Like, who cares? Right.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.740]   And then you will find a way to be successful
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:56.980]   because if you listen to this podcast an hour in or whatever we're in,
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.680]   like you're a legit person.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.060]   You're going to find a way to be massively successful within the rules
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.900]   that you establish. So establish them.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.560]   Don't just play what's given to you.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.800]   Define what you want to do, what sounds amazing, and then just go after that.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.600]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.100]   I get it. Life comes at you fast.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.880]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.920]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.920]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.360]   the go to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.440]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.500]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.680]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.140]   or maybe you just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.080]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   your to do list,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.880]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.920]   without ever leaving yours.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.960]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.900]   on their massive selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.300]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.560]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.940]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.940]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to Drizzly.com.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.840]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.180]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.520]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.320]   about life, money and so much more, but sometimes it's helpful
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.820]   to talk to other people in your situation,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.260]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.560]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.500]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.000]   and everything from technology, finance, medicine to real estate,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.440]   law, manufacturing and more.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.840]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.380]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.580]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.620]   investments.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.920]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members are first generation wealth,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.360]   young, highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.960]   and learn from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.460]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.540]   private market investment opportunities.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.500]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.180]   to you on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.580]   to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.520]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.380]   So if you have more than two point two million in investable assets,
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:44.220]   which is their minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.500]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.460]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.300]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.000]   Again, that's longangleangle.com.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.940]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.820]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.760]   If you haven't read the book from Strength to Strength from Arthur Brooks,
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.720]   I think you should. I think you'd enjoy it.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.400]   I had him on the podcast, and it's about finding a new form of happiness
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:32.040]   as you transition from a style of intelligence and work in your early life
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.540]   that isn't as compatible in the second half of life.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   And second half is not like 70s.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.840]   It's like, you know, late 30s, 40s kind of age.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.740]   We were like, I'm finding a new way to work
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.880]   that is more compatible with long term happiness.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.240]   That's one book I shared.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.380]   You shared a lot of books.
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.320]   Are there other books? Where do you find them?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.860]   You seem to have them and collected them, and they've had a huge impact on you.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.060]   Do you publish a list of them
[00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.680]   so people who want more of your recommendations can find them?
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.920]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.800]   So I do read a lot.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.960]   I read about a book a week on average, sometimes two, sometimes half.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   I depends on how busy I am.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.740]   But I probably average 50 to 100 books a year, pretty much every year.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.900]   I have a rule with books.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.600]   If I think about buying a book, if even the hint of an idea of like,
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.740]   oh, that might be a good book, I always buy it.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.880]   I think books are the best investment in the entire universe.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:18.680]   I don't think anything comes close to the monetary investment of a book.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.880]   But I don't have a list anywhere, per se.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.780]   I do have a text message newsletter.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.880]   Everyone does like newsletters.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.320]   And I was like, how can I be different?
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.660]   So I have a text message newsletter.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.700]   Every Wednesday, I send out a text that has like a book that I'm reading
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.800]   and some little piece of advice that I got, et cetera.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.760]   So that's just beardybrandon.com.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.940]   There's no like sales.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.900]   I'm not selling anything there.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.660]   It's just like I read a lot.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.200]   So I'm always like, hey, here's what I'm reading right now.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.880]   Here's a cool point from the book that they made.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.580]   I read a lot.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.680]   I mean, I give you five million recommendations
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.340]   and I remember a lot of what I read as well,
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.880]   because I always assume I'm going to have to teach it.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.720]   You ever seen those studies?
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.020]   Like you remember whatever, 10% of what you hear and 20% of what you read,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.960]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.760]   The studies have shown that the number one best way to remember
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.900]   something is not to teach it, per se.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.220]   I've heard that said before, but it's actually a little more nuanced than that.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.140]   It's to learn as if you had to teach it.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.600]   So every time I read a book, I assume I'm going to have to teach
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.980]   this to somebody later, even my own spouse.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.180]   So when you read from that perspective, your mind like files it away
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.680]   in a different part of the brain that's easier to recall later on.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.080]   And so I heard this hack 20 years ago, but it's made such an impact on my life
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.620]   as I read everything now with a pen and I assume I'm going to have to teach it later,
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:30.680]   even though I might not.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.180]   And then I remember it's all up here.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.720]   Not all of it, but a lot of it's up there.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.060]   Do you use that pen to take notes, use physical books, not e-books?
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.100]   What's the process?
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.400]   I do. Audible is great.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.640]   If I'm working out, I'm usually listening to an audio book.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.760]   But usually audio is more for podcasts because you can't read a podcast
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.440]   very easily. And I try to only do physical books.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.300]   Kindle, I'll do fiction books because I'm not underlining and whatever.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.340]   So Kindle's for fiction, physical for nonfiction.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.280]   And then I actually get asked all the time, how do you read so many books?
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.640]   And I'm like, I literally just read for like 10 minutes a day.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:04.460]   It's not much, but I also read whenever I have a quick break.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.120]   I try to read instead of pull up my phone and scroll.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.100]   Like as soon as that pull to grab my phone.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.200]   And I'm not great at this at all, I'll say I'm terrible at this.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.060]   But I try whenever that pull to my phone like that.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.540]   I need that dopamine hit.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.460]   I'll look around.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.800]   And if there's a book near me, I'll grab that instead.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.380]   I'll try to grab that instead.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.000]   And I'll just read a couple of pages.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.680]   My two, three, four pages. I'll put it down.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.040]   I'm typically in the middle of 20 to 30 books at any given time,
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.740]   which is completely nuts.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.380]   But a topic for another day that is.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.960]   Yeah, yeah, that is doable, though.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.220]   You talked about the purpose of all this isn't just to have a boatload of money.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.920]   It's not just to be a billionaire and all that.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.720]   And you've talked a lot about philanthropy
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.000]   and how that's become a bigger focus in your life.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.460]   And I think beyond just saying why it's important,
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.900]   you've thought about ways to infuse it into your future business,
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.540]   your future endeavors.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.140]   Talk a bit about why it's important, but also how you're trying
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.680]   to bring it into your business
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   that maybe is different than the way most people think about philanthropy.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.980]   Few ways that I'm looking at it right now.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.020]   First of all, everyone believes this, but I really internalize it.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.280]   Is that like nobody gets out alive?
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.780]   Like we all die and it doesn't make sense to be the richest guy in the graveyard.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.320]   I don't care about legacy.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.180]   I don't care about my kids being rich.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.560]   Like I don't plan to actually give my kids anything.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.460]   Maybe they'll get a little bit.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.960]   Maybe get a property or two, whatever.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.400]   So they get the college savings.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.820]   Yes, they get the college thing. Yeah.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.160]   And what's great about that, too, by the way, just go way back
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.500]   to the last episode that we did together.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.300]   But that property, like I don't care if Rosie takes that one property
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.240]   and goes to college with it or she starts a business.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.640]   I actually hope she'll just start a business with it or invest it in something.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.080]   But anyway, I don't need my kid to be rich
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.240]   because a like you can't grow up in the Brennan Turner household
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.980]   and not have all the skills you need to be successful, first of all,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.320]   because like I'm going to train here, I train them every day.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.220]   I'm always talking about money and finances and entrepreneurship.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.760]   And Rosie has bake sales.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.960]   And while there will, you know, when he's a little older.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.600]   So either a if they're not wealthy by the time they're in their mid 20s,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.760]   then there is some problem that they don't deserve the money anyway.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.220]   My kids will either not need the money because they'll be so successful anyway,
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.500]   or they don't deserve the money because they can't handle it.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.860]   So anyway, that's why I'm not planning to get my kids money.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.160]   So in other words, what do I do with it then?
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.500]   I mean, wealth is kind of a game in some ways.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.300]   I don't have to earn more money and get wealthier, but it's a fun challenge.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.600]   Like, can I give away a billion dollars?
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.280]   I would have laughed at that 10 years ago.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.640]   And now I'm like, well, shoot.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.340]   Yeah, I could definitely give away a billion dollars.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.680]   Plus, happiness is largely derived from most people by giving away money
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.780]   and not just like throwing some random charity,
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.720]   but by doing something with it, like it's one thing to make money.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.280]   It's another thing to make money matter.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.500]   So I want to spend a lot of my time making money because I'm good at it.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.460]   I'm not just going to give away all my money right now and go live under a bridge
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.900]   like I have been gifted with this ability to generate massive amounts of money.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.200]   I'm going to use that to its fullest ability.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.840]   And I'm going to make that money count.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.240]   I'm going to make it matter through business.
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.180]   So a couple of ways we do that.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.880]   Number one, there's like the obvious, like we try to take good care of our tenants
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.080]   and be good people and all that.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.180]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.920]   We're going to raise capital for big apartment complexes,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.820]   and then we're going to take all the profit from that and just donate it.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.020]   So, for example, let me give you a real simple.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.060]   We buy a hundred million dollar building right now.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.100]   It's pretty normal by, let's say, a hundred million dollar building.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.860]   We have to raise 20 or 30 million dollars from investors like you.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.160]   You give the money, we will buy the property.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.000]   At the end of the deal, we sell it for one hundred and fifty million dollars.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.380]   Very normal, very just three percent, four percent per year
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.300]   over the course of 10 years, it gets there.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.480]   And then at the end of the deal, everyone gets their piece of the pie
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.040]   and everyone is happy.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.380]   But what I want to do is I want to raise all that money.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.880]   And then at the end of the deal, when we sell the property to three,
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.620]   four or five years later, you get your investment back.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.560]   But all the profit, that 50 million dollars goes to charity.
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.020]   And I'm like, I could do like one of those a year
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.620]   and be like the biggest charity in the country.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:51.700]   Like, it's stupid how good real estate and especially my division
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.240]   of real estate syndication and multifamily.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.580]   It's stupid how much profit we can create out of thin air
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.820]   with that level of assuredness of that little surety.
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.080]   And so if I can just take like one out of every 10 deals I do
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.320]   and just donate it to good, that makes everyone feel good.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.660]   And then the LP is even like you, if you were investing in that.
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.800]   Not only do you get to feel good, not only do you get your money back,
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.920]   you're not even donating it.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.500]   You're just lending the money for a little while.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.140]   Basically, you also get a big tax write off at the end.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.860]   And so it's like a win, win, win across the board.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.700]   Everyone feels good. Everybody wins.
[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.500]   We're saving lives.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.600]   We're stopping human trafficking. We're feeding kids.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.880]   It's going to be a good life.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.880]   So I'm fired up about that right now.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.380]   I love it.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.480]   I think that's a great way to wrap this conversation.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.520]   But there is one thing that I like to ask everyone before we go,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.260]   and it's to pick a place.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.820]   And because I'm heading to Maui, I'm going to just default you to pick Maui.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.160]   People that are coming to Maui, what should they be doing, eating,
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.520]   drinking to have a good trip?
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.900]   Oh, dude. OK, so first of all, if you drink alcohol,
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   Monkey Pod is my favorite restaurant on the island.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.360]   Monkey Pod has a drink. It's called the Mai Tai.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.840]   It's not like a normal Mai Tai if you've had one.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.980]   Just get the Monkey Pod Mai Tai. It's phenomenal.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.240]   Anything at Monkey Pod is phenomenal.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.540]   Anything there is amazing.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:06.040]   The sidemen, the pizza, pork and pineapple, the burger, one of the best ever.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.920]   All right. So Monkey Pod, amazing Maui Brewing Company.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.360]   It's one over where you're going to be staying.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.160]   There's also one by my house down here.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.560]   Maui brew is amazing.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.020]   Moku Roots, if you're vegan, awesome vegan restaurant.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.520]   I'm not vegan, but it's phenomenal.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.620]   Just those vegan people.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.460]   So that's the food.
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.000]   I mean, there's a lot of good food on Maui.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.760]   But Tin Roof up in Kahului, the Mochiko chicken sandwich.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.020]   Oh, you just can't imagine better food than that.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.560]   It's so good.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.960]   And then there's beaches everywhere.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.100]   Make sure you cliff dive off Black Rock, which is right over by the Ritz
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.380]   and the Sheraton and that whole kind of area there.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.440]   And then come down to Wailea, which is like a 40 minute drive
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.840]   from the other side of the island, where like Kanapali.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.080]   But there's some lava fields down here.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.320]   You can drive through the lava fields, go to Big Beach.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.960]   If you want to see a bunch of naked men, go to Little Beach.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.020]   It's a great spot.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.720]   And then, oh, man, it's so good, man.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.520]   I can give you a thousand recommendations.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.760]   Any of the activities that are worth doing.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.460]   For sure, Road to Hana, everyone does the Road to Hana.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.400]   Have you ever done the Road to Hana?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:44:59.900]   Have you been to Maui?
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.900]   I've never been to Maui.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.940]   The Road to Hana seems like a great thing to do on a trip
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:07.940]   when you're not in tow with a three month old and a two year old.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.000]   Yes, probably.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:11.940]   You do get out a lot.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:12.980]   So here's the Road to Hana.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.280]   It's the best analogy for life, too.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.440]   Road to Hana, I did it once with some friends.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.320]   We all left at the same time.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.180]   There's no cell phone coverage on the Road to Hana.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.480]   So we leave and we stop at the first beach and we get out there.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.720]   We look at like 50 turtles that are on the beach, just sunbathing these turtles,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   watching these world class surfers, like just ripping on these surf waves.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.020]   Having a great time.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.720]   Sat down, watched this for a little bit, got back in the car, started driving.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:38.360]   To get to Hana, it takes us typically four to six hours.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.000]   An hour in, we leave the beach.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:41.800]   We're just starting.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.100]   We're not even a mile on this road.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.000]   And I get a call from my friends and they've got cell phone reception.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   I hadn't even lost it yet.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.780]   And they said, OK, we're in Hana. Now what?
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.420]   And I was like, oh, no, there's nothing in Hana.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.120]   You missed the point.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.080]   It's not about the destination.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.620]   It's about the journey.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.060]   So the Road to Hana is an amazing just picture of life
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.060]   and that there's nothing.
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.300]   Now, maybe there is something at the end of life.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.020]   I believe there is.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.420]   Like, I'm a Christian guy, so I think there is.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.960]   But the point is, like, the point of life is not just to get to the end.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.060]   It's to enjoy it along the way.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.040]   So you could do Road to Hana with some little ones.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.400]   You stop every like 20 minutes to pull over and like see amazing
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.280]   waterfalls and turtles and stuff.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.040]   So Road to Hana is beautiful and awesome.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.680]   But I would understand if you don't want to take a baby on it.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.740]   It's probably not a bad call.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.620]   Awesome. All right.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.480]   Well, I'm even more excited about Maui, especially for the Eats.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   Where can everyone?
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.180]   Oh, I found out the best thing in all of Maui.
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:35.520]   You take your family, you put them in the car, you drive over to Kihei,
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.820]   which is the area I live in.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.960]   You come up here to my road and you pull in my driveway.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.660]   And then we hang out on my front lanai, it's called the lanai.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.360]   It's like a front porch.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.760]   The kids swim in my pool.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.940]   And you and I sit there and chat business for a couple hours.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.740]   That is the best thing you can do in Maui.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.140]   So I'm officially inviting you here publicly to come hang out if you can.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.500]   I will see you in a couple of weeks.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.680]   This has been fantastic.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.120]   Where can everyone listening stay on top of everything you're doing, working,
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.220]   building this $10 billion of real estate you want to buy one day?
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.280]   How do they stay on top?
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.220]   Yeah. So the text message list is a good one.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:07.460]   Just Beardy, B-E-A-R-D-Y, beard with a Y.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.660]   BeardyBrandon.com is a text message thing.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.700]   And if anybody's interested in the real estate side of stuff,
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.700]   like, you know, investing with me and all that.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:18.240]   odcfund, odcfund.com.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.300]   And if you go to odcfund.com/tax,
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.500]   I've got an e-book on taxes there, just it's a short read on
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.840]   how do people save money on taxes, especially if you're wealthy?
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.540]   How does Donald Trump pay no taxes?
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.940]   Anyway, it's just a random thing I just put together a few weeks ago.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.280]   That's where it's at.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.380]   And for those of you who are not watching on YouTube, BeardyBrandon
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.780]   is because Brandon is rocking an incredible beard.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:42.060]   We've been doing a lot to take the video from this and put on YouTube.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.900]   So I'm going to encourage everyone, if you haven't checked out
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.620]   the YouTube channel, definitely check it out.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.560]   Subscribe. Thank you for doing that.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.000]   And you get to check out this great beard.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.100]   Not the one I don't have, but the one Brandon has.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.340]   Brandon, thank you so much for this extended conversation.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.400]   This was fun, man. You're not bad at this.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.580]   You've done this a time or two, I can tell. Good.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.380]   Thanks for having me.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.640]   I hope you all enjoyed the rest of my conversation with Brandon.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:05.820]   I know I did.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.760]   If you're heading to Maui, definitely take him up on his recommendation
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.880]   to go to Monkey Pod.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.260]   We went and it was one of the highlights of the trip,
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.760]   though that might have been because it was the only night
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.820]   we snuck out to dinner without the kids.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:17.620]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.900]   I absolutely love them.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.460]   But there is something wonderful about having a date with just your spouse.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.400]   Finally, lots of good stuff coming for the rest of the year.
