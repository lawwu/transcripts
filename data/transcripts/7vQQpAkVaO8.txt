[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.500]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians, in the first chapter and the eighth verse, the eighth verse
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.420]   in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.660]   But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.480]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.560]   But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.600]   we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.580]   I read that particular verse as my text this evening, not because I propose to deal only
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.320]   with that verse, but because it does seem to me to concentrate our attention upon the
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.140]   particular aspect of the message and the teaching of this first chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.620]   to the Galatians to which I am anxious to call your attention.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.200]   I am really calling attention to the whole chapter, and I am doing so because in this
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.060]   chapter I think we can claim that we have one of the plainest, clearest, simplest, and
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.220]   most direct statements concerning the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ that
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.900]   we have anywhere in the whole realm and range of the scriptures.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:52.620]   The Apostle here puts before us, in, as I say, a very simple way, what are the fundamental
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.680]   elements, the very first principles of the Christian faith.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.860]   And I don't know of any clearer statement of this than the one which we have here.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.220]   Now the great Apostle did this in this chapter, as indeed he does in the whole of the epistle,
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.460]   because in a sense he had been driven to do so by the extraordinary muddle into which
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.780]   some of these Christian people in the churches of Galatia had found themselves in.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.420]   You notice how he puts it in verse 6.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:40.900]   He says, "I marvel, I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you unto
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.020]   the grace of Christ unto another gospel."
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.020]   He can scarcely believe it, and yet he knows that this thing is perfectly true.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.060]   He marvels at it for this reason, that he had been preaching amongst these people, and
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.140]   he had declared to them the first principles of the gospel.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.660]   You will find that he says in the third chapter, "O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.700]   you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.940]   set forth crucified among you."
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.380]   Now what he means by that is that he had been, as he puts it, placarding the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.380]   before them.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.980]   He had been preaching about him and about his death, and he had put it in such simple
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.700]   and direct language that he says, "I can even say that I was placarding him, putting
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.980]   it there in its first principles and elements."
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.540]   Well now, he had been doing that, and they had believed this gospel, and it wasn't
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.220]   so long ago that he had been doing this very thing.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.500]   And yet here they are, they've been listening to certain other people, and he says, "I
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.140]   can't believe it that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.660]   Christ and to another gospel, which is not another, but there be some that trouble you
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.020]   and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.460]   Well because that had happened, and these people were in this muddled state and condition,
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.460]   the apostle takes up his pen and he writes this letter to them.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.900]   And what he really is saying is this, "Now," he says, "in view of this muddle, I want
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.020]   to put it all before you again in its stark simplicity, so that there may be no misunderstanding
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.860]   or any confusion any longer.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.100]   Let me bring you back," he says, "again to the first principles and to the very
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.980]   fundamentals."
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.500]   And I'm calling attention to this chapter because I feel that there is great need of
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.460]   the same thing just at this present time.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.500]   Is it not indeed marvelous to observe—I use the apostle's term—is it not marvelous
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.460]   to observe the extraordinary ideas that are current as to what Christianity is, as to
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.500]   what it means, as to what it's meant to do?
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.180]   Now I say it's marvelous for this reason, that the position today is even worse than
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.980]   it was amongst these Galatians.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:38.540]   They were a very primitive people according to all accounts, highly emotional people without
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   much knowledge or teaching or understanding.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.700]   Well in a sense you can understand them being unstable and misunderstanding and ready to
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.700]   believe the false doctrines.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:56.540]   But I say, is it not more marvelous, is it not more astounding, that the modern man,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.620]   the modern world, with its knowledge and its learning and so on, and—and this is what
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.740]   I want to emphasize—with an open Bible before it, no longer dependent simply upon the spoken
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.300]   word as these Galatians were, just the words of the apostle who paid them a hurried visit.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.700]   No, no, we've had the open Bible before us for so many centuries.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:25.180]   It's been here in the English language for four centuries, open, accessible to anybody
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.580]   who likes to take the trouble to read it.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:35.340]   Here it is, in language, as the Reformers put it, "understanded of the people."
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.660]   And yet the ideas with regard to what it is and what it's all about and what it's meant
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.020]   to do, I say, are almost endless in number and contradict one another, and therefore
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.900]   I am arguing that there is as great a need tonight as there was when the apostle took
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:02.180]   up his pen to write to these Galatians of reminding men and women what be, as the author
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:09.700]   of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it, "the first principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.500]   In other words, my contention is that the Church is as she is, and the world is as it
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:26.940]   is, because of this same old trouble, this confusion as to what is the real nature and
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:35.740]   essence of this Christian faith, this Christian message, this Christian gospel, which we meet
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.300]   together to consider in the Christian Church.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.260]   Very well, what I am proposing to do, God willing, on a number of Sunday nights is this.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.980]   I am proposing to hold before you the way in which the great apostle Paul dealt with
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.900]   that situation amongst these Galatian people.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:03.220]   He puts us here, I say, face to face with all the primary truths, the central elements,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:09.420]   the things without which there is no Christianity, the things which without our understanding
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.300]   them we cannot really claim to be Christian at all.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.100]   Very well, here we are looking at the basic elements.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.220]   So I start with the question, what is Christianity?
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.220]   What is the Christian message, the Christian faith?
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.220]   What is it all about?
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:36.780]   Or, to put it in a still more practical form, why should we be concerned about it at all?
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.000]   Why should we listen to it?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.740]   Why do we meet together like this, Sunday by Sunday, to consider this message?
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.820]   Surely that is the first question.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.900]   We must have some reason for doing it.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.800]   It isn't mere habit or custom, is it?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.460]   But what is the true reason?
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.500]   What has all this got to do with the modern world and its teeming masses of people, its
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.060]   pressing problems, its urgent situations?
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.020]   What is this?
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.180]   What does it offer to us?
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.740]   What does it claim that it can do?
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.020]   What is its message to us?
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.500]   Well, now, the apostle here, in this one chapter, answers that question I think I'll be able
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.340]   to show you in a thoroughly exhaustive manner.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.420]   And we must proceed, therefore, to consider exactly what he's got to tell us.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.700]   What is Christianity?
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.820]   What is the Christian faith?
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.300]   What is the Christian message?
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.780]   His first answer is this.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.860]   It is a gospel.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:46.820]   I marvel, he says, that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.800]   Christ and to another gospel, which is not a gospel.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.700]   Very well, here is his first term.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.460]   Now, it's a term with which we are all familiar.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.820]   We talk about the gospel, the Christian gospel, the gospel of the New Testament.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.980]   We talk about the four gospels in the New Testament.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:12.720]   Now, we've all used this term, I'm quite sure, hundreds, not to say thousands of times.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.620]   But do we know what it means?
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.260]   And all the trouble, I mean now not only the trouble in the church in general, are not
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:27.060]   our individual difficulties about Christianity due to the fact that we've taken certain terms
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.180]   and have used them without knowing what they mean.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.140]   We've never troubled to look at them, to examine them, to ask questions of them.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:39.220]   We go on repeating terms without having any knowledge at all as to their real content
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.660]   and connotation.
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.260]   What do you mean by gospel?
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.580]   The apostle says this is a gospel.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.700]   Well, what is it?
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.300]   Well, this is the most important point.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.540]   It's the first point which we must be clear about as we consider this message.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:59.660]   Well, the gospel, I'm reminding you, just means good news.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.060]   That's what Christianity is, good news.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.440]   It's the very term that is used.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.580]   Very well then, isn't this rather important for us?
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:17.820]   Now this isn't an isolated term that's used only here, as I've been indicating already.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.260]   This is the term that is used about Christianity and about this message everywhere in the New
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.260]   Testament.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.020]   Go back to the beginning of the Gospels and what you find there.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:34.500]   Well, what you find at once is there's a kind of excitement.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.220]   Something is being announced which is strange, which is marvelous, which is wonderful.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.660]   Do you remember the archangel and the other angels appearing to various people?
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.500]   Do you remember the story of old Zacharias, who became the father of John the Baptist
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.140]   there in the temple?
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.420]   He was just doing his turn of service.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.780]   The thing was quite ordinary.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.400]   This had been done by many others.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.780]   He wasn't expecting anything unusual.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.020]   Suddenly one afternoon he goes in and an angel appeared to him.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.020]   He's taken aback.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.020]   He's astounded.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.060]   And he's given a message.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.220]   And what was the message?
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.900]   Well, that though he and his wife Elizabeth were so old, they were going to be given a
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.260]   son and he was going to be very wonderful.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:22.140]   He was going to be the forerunner of the long-expected messiah, the good news.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.220]   It's astounding.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.220]   It's amazing.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.620]   Hurry on and listen to the archangel coming to the Virgin Mary.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.820]   "Hail," he says, "Hail thou that art blessed amongst women."
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.340]   He's going to tell her something thrilling and astounding.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.340]   And what does he tell her?
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.420]   Well, it's this message about a son that's going to be born of her, and he's going to
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.180]   be great, and he's going to be mighty.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   The kingdom of his father David is going to be given to him, and of this kingdom there
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180]   shall be no end.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.060]   And it's so marvelous an announcement that Mary can't believe it.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.780]   She staggered in unbelief and said, "How can this thing be?"
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.140]   Well, that's how this Christianity always begins.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.300]   That's how it always comes.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   It's good news.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.940]   It's thrilling good news.
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.440]   It's exciting news.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.260]   And then when the son of God was born, you remember, oh, that famous night in Bethlehem.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.740]   You remember what we are told about some shepherds who were there watching their flocks by night
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:28.420]   in the fields, most ordinary night, expecting nothing at all unusual.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.860]   Here they were doing something they'd done thousands of times before.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:38.500]   Suddenly they hear some heavenly singing, and here they listen to some heavenly choir
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:45.180]   singing, "Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace amongst men."
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.180]   What is this?
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.180]   What's happening?
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.180]   Well, it's something tremendous.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.840]   It's good news.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:59.880]   "Their bearings, their bearers of glad tidings, unto you is born this day in the city of David
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.600]   a Savior, which is Christ the Lord."
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.120]   Now, that's how your Gospels begin, is it not?
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   And this note runs right through them.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.240]   The Lord himself went about preaching, announcing this wonderful good news.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   He sends out the others, "Go and proclaim it," he says.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.640]   And all the time they're proclaiming a message of good news.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.860]   It's Gospel!
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.200]   And the same you will find in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and indeed in all
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.360]   the remainder of the New Testament.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.280]   This is a Gospel, my dear friend.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.200]   And not only is it described like that and that at its concomitance in the New Testament,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.840]   go back to your Old Testament.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.520]   Read your prophets concerning it, as they are given a preview of it, as God gave them
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.400]   the message that it was going to come.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.320]   And listen to them, how lyrical they become, how they burst into song, "Comfort ye, comfort
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   ye my people, saith my God."
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   What's happening?
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.040]   Well, he's going to give them double for all their sins.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.500]   How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that publish peace and bring glad
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.760]   tidings.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   That's it.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   Look at them.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   They're coming.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.120]   There are men crossing the mountains.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   What are they?
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.320]   They're messengers of peace, they're bearers of good news, they've got glad tidings for
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   the people.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   What's this?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.360]   This is a prophecy of the coming of this Christian Gospel.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.240]   And I could take you through my Old Testament prophecies in that way and go right away back
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.760]   even to the historical books and back into the five books of Moses, and all along I would
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:46.240]   have to say the same thing, "There is this anticipation, something marvelous is going
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   to happen.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.680]   A prophet is going to come, like unto Moses, and he's going to do astounding things.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   Good news."
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:03.120]   "Very well," I said, "the first thing the Apostle tells us about this message, and he
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:10.280]   reminds these Galatians of it, and we need to be reminded of it today, is that the first
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:17.800]   and the greatest characteristic of this message is that it is the most astonishing good news
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.180]   that has ever come into this world."
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.760]   Now then, my friends, let's test ourselves by this.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.480]   Is that your habitual way of thinking of the Gospel?
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.320]   If I'd asked you, "Oh no, what's your idea of the Gospel?
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.400]   How's it come to you?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.640]   What's it say to you?"
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.480]   Would you tell me things like that?
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.440]   Well, no, I put my question for this reason, "Oh, there are ideas current about this Gospel
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:57.480]   which don't contain anything whatsoever of this element of good news."
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.760]   There are some people who think that the whole business of this message is just to exhort
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.960]   us to be good, to be moral, to live a good life.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   What's Christianity?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.920]   It's being a gentleman.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   What's to be a Christian?
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.640]   Well, a Christian is a man who doesn't do certain things, and he does other things.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.720]   So the preaching of the Gospel to them consists of moral exhortation, constant appeals to
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.120]   people to live a good life, to stop doing certain things, to begin doing other things.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.520]   That's their whole notion of Christianity.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.160]   Is that good news?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.440]   Is there anything thrilling or exciting about that?
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.960]   Why the world is full of that, you'd got that before Christ ever came.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.720]   Your Greek philosophers did that in their moral and ethical teaching.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.080]   The world was full of that before the Son of God ever came into it.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.600]   That's not Christianity.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   Don't misunderstand me.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.040]   A Christian's a good man, yes, but he isn't only a good man.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:04.400]   There must be this element of good news, exciting, thrilling, wonderful, inexplicable, unexpected
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   good news.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:13.680]   It isn't mere inculcation of morality, yet how often does the presentation of this message
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.720]   do just that and nothing more at all?
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.920]   As if the Christian Church were just one of a number of moral agencies in this world.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:29.960]   Then take another view of it, which is that it's just some general philosophizing with
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.000]   respect to life.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.440]   You know this idea that life is difficult and hard and trying.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.680]   Well, people need a bit of comfort.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.400]   And what's the preaching of the gospel?
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.120]   Well, it's that which gives them comfort.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.520]   So you quote the poets and its beautiful language and its uplifting thought and you feel a little
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.600]   bit better and perhaps a thrill may pass down your spine if it's particularly good.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   And there you are.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:03.680]   You feel better for a while and you go back into the world and that's Christianity.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.040]   General philosophizing with respect to life, telling men and women that though things are
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.240]   bad they might be worse and that after all things are never quite as bad as they appear
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:21.640]   to be, and a general kind of uplift and cheer and making us feel better for the nonce.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.840]   Is that something that merits the designation gospel?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840]   But this is gospel.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.720]   Or then think of those who regard it simply as an idealism, as one of the many views of
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.440]   the idealistic view of life.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.920]   Oh, I mustn't keep you with these things, but I'm driven to mention them.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.080]   The apostles are to mention them in the case of these Galatians.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   They were doing harm.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.400]   They'd produced a muddle in Galatia and they're muddling the whole situation today.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.920]   Men and women are not interested in Christianity because it's misrepresented in these various
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   ways.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   There are others, you see, who seem to think that the preaching of the gospel is nothing
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.680]   but a constant protest against certain evils.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.240]   The preaching of this message seems to them to be nothing but a protest against drink
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.600]   or a protest against war or a protest against the atomic bomb or the protest against what
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.440]   people are supposed to be doing in South Africa.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.200]   And that seems to be the whole message.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.640]   Is that good news?
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.400]   Where's the good news in all that?
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.560]   It's just absent.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   That isn't the gospel, my dear friend.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:35.200]   If the gospel doesn't come with this thrilling central element of good news, it is not the
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.400]   gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.080]   And I can say the same about those who seem to think that this message is nothing but
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.400]   a social and political program.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.120]   And so they talk about its application in order to change this and improve that.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.640]   It's just a part of a social political program.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.400]   And I ask again, where is the element of good news?
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.480]   Is that the thing that made Isaiah sing and shout out, "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people"?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.940]   Is that the thing that made these men strain their eyes to look at the very feet of these
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.980]   bearers of the glad tidings that were coming over the hilltops of the centuries?
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.980]   Is that good news?
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.280]   No, no, it's not there.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.320]   And it's a travesty of the gospel.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:37.360]   The thing that differentiates this from everything else is that it is something great and grand
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.000]   and moving and thrilling.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.800]   This is either the best news that has ever come into the world or it's nothing.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:55.520]   But the apostle reminds these Galatians that it is this thrilling, marvelous, moving good
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.160]   news which has come from God, to whom be glory forever and ever, he says.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.800]   Amen, in his very introduction.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.840]   So I like to put it in this way.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:18.520]   If your conception of the gospel and mine doesn't lead us with this man of God to some
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.400]   kind of apostrophe such as this, though we are but writing the introduction of our letter,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:33.560]   if it doesn't make us burst forth into an ascription of glory to God forever and ever—Amen!—in
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:41.480]   some shape or form, well, then it seems to me that we are in the Galatian position and
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:48.040]   that some way or another we've got hold of the wrong thing and we are in a complete muddle
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440]   with respect to this gospel.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.560]   Has it ever thrilled you?
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.320]   Has it ever moved you?
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.600]   Have you ever felt that it's the most wonderful thing that the world has ever known?
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:05.860]   And has it made you bow down before God in wonder, love, and praise?
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.720]   It's a gospel.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.540]   But wait a minute, let me move on.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:17.240]   The second thing he tells us about it is that this gospel is something that is perfectly
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:27.600]   clear, something that is well-defined, something discreet.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.840]   Now this is again tremendously important.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.800]   You notice how the apostle keeps on repeating this point.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.280]   He's not content with saying it once.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.560]   He goes on saying it.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.580]   He repeats it more and more because it is so necessary that this should be clear.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.200]   The gospel of Jesus Christ, I say, is something that can be not only described, it can be
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.560]   defined, it can be stated in propositions.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.640]   We can say exactly what it is and what it isn't.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:06.480]   Now then, I know that when I put it like that, I'm saying something that is not only not
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   known today, but which is heartily disliked.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:17.800]   I know that I'm putting it in a form that the average person today objects to even violently,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.720]   but I'm driven to do so.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.320]   The words used by the apostle compel this.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.200]   Listen, let's put it like this, first of all negatively.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:35.000]   This message, this Christian message, this Christian faith, is not a collection of vague
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.960]   ideas about goodness and about the good life and things like that.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   No, no.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.880]   There's nothing vague about this.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:55.480]   Neither less must we think of it as some vague and nebulous, mystic feeling which baffles
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.200]   description and prohibits analysis.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.160]   Now, there are many who hold their view of it.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.720]   The idea of the gospel as just a morality, or as Matthew Arnold put it, you remember
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:17.260]   his definition of Christianity was, it's, he said, morality tinged with emotion.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.040]   He at any rate had the insight to see that there must be some emotion in it, that morality
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560]   alone is not enough.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.920]   And the idea that was so current up till thirty years ago that it's mere morality that's
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920]   gone.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:36.360]   And now the popular idea is that Christianity really is some mystical experience, a wonderful
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.880]   experience, but it's something that you feel and you can't describe it and you can't
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   define it.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.000]   And, indeed, it is almost sacrilege to attempt to analyze it and to define it.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.080]   A man once said, you know, that to attempt to describe and to define and to analyze the
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.360]   Christian faith was like trying to dissect a rose, that when you dissected it you hadn't
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.880]   got a rose any longer, you destroyed it.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.640]   Or, they sometimes put it like this, I remember reading in a man's book a few years ago, his
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.240]   description of the Christianity and the Christian message, and he put it in this form.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.360]   He said, you know, this is the way I would describe it.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:23.160]   He said, imagine a man who has been told that if only he climbs to the top of a great mountain
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.160]   over there that he'll get a most marvelous view.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.880]   From the top of that mountain there stretches out before the eye a most amazing panorama,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.960]   indescribable and thrilling scenery.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.320]   But he's got to get up to the top of the mountain before he can see it.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:46.640]   Well, off he goes, starts walking the main roads, branches off to the secondary roads,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.240]   even leaves them, gets onto mountain paths, and up he's going, climbing the mountain.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.780]   Soon he loses even the paths, and at times he's down on hands and knees, clutching onto
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.960]   crags and rocks and bits of grass.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.320]   He's anxious to get to the top, he wants to see the view.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.720]   At long last he gets there, hands and knees bleeding, the sun's been shining upon him
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.160]   and he's sweating.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:16.200]   But there at last he stands on the summit and looks at the panorama, and what does he
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.280]   do about it?
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:25.440]   Well, said the man in the book, he just stands with his eyes and his mouth wide open.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.440]   Can he go back and reduce that to propositions?
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.560]   Can he define that?
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.720]   Can he say this is this and it isn't that?
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.240]   "Nonsense," says the man, "you can't reduce things like that to propositions.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.600]   You can't define.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   The only thing to do about a thing like that is to sing, not to dance.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.000]   I can see a man doing that," he says, "but I cannot see him describing it and arguing
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.800]   about it in propositions.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:54.080]   It's this vague, indefinite, nebulous, mystical feeling and experience.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   That's Christianity."
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:03.560]   Well, I'm very sorry, but it isn't Christianity.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:10.040]   You can get that not only in other religions, you can get it apart from religion altogether.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.720]   The poets are very fond of that sort of thing, aren't they?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.520]   But that isn't Christianity.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.200]   It isn't a vague, indefinite, nebulous experience or mystic feeling.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.160]   Thank God there's a mystical element in it, and it includes experience.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.840]   But it isn't only that, I say.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   "No, no," by definition, says the apostle, "this can be defined."
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.080]   Or, again, let me put it in this way.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:43.320]   I'm taking up these popular modern ideas with regard to what Christianity is.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:51.400]   Another very popular idea is that this is the quest and the search for truth and for
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.560]   ultimate reality.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.920]   "Oh," says this modern, sophisticated, intellectual person, "you can't say that
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.480]   you've arrived at truth, that's intellectual arrogance.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.560]   You should be seeking it, you should be searching for it.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:14.000]   Truth is glorious, and the quest is exciting, and with our great minds and brains and all
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.440]   our reading and all our listening, we're out in the quest for truth and for reality.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   Have I arrived?
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.880]   Of course I haven't arrived.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.120]   Who is any man to say that he's arrived?
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.640]   You can't arrive, they say.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.160]   The thing is too immense for arriving and for definitions and for certainty.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.240]   No, no, we hope that we'll get a glimpse.
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:39.800]   We hope that we'll sometime know something, we're just pressing on in the quest."
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.120]   Is that Christianity?
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.360]   Well, listen to what this man has got to say.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.240]   He puts it like this.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.760]   He talks about this and that, and he says this is not that and that is not this.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.920]   Well, that means definition, doesn't it?
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   Listen to him again.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.000]   "I marvel," he says, "that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.640]   grace of Christ, unto another gospel which is not another."
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.560]   Now, I say the moment you talk about this gospel and another gospel, you must have some
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.560]   sort of stand-in.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:19.240]   If it's just a vague mystical feeling, how can he talk about leaving this and taking
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.420]   up another?
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.280]   You can't define these things because, according to their own definitions, these things baffle
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.200]   description, they baffle definition.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.840]   It's a marvelous feeling that I know, but Paul says you've left this and you've gone
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.960]   to another.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.120]   This and another mean definition and certainty and discreteness.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.200]   And then, you remember, he goes on to say, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:52.400]   any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you."
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   But that means that he knows exactly what he did preach to them, and he knows that these
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.120]   other people who'd been creeping in had been preaching something else to them.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.220]   Obviously it's a matter of definition.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.000]   Obviously it is possible for us to say what the Christian message is and what the Christian
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:18.180]   message isn't, otherwise the whole language which is used by the Apostle is utterly meaningless.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:23.880]   And then look at another term that he uses, which is not another, he says, "But there
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:31.280]   be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ."
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.080]   Well, now, what does pervert mean?
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.520]   Well, it means to twist something.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.680]   Well, if it means to twist something, it means that it was straight before.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   And you can tell whether a thing is straight or whether it's twisted.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:52.320]   So that all these ideas about Christianity, that it is something indefinite and vague,
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:58.360]   whether intellectual vagueness and uncertainty or vagueness in the matter of experience and
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:05.480]   the realm of the emotions, they're all just a denial of what this Apostle is saying.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.020]   You can know whether you're a Christian or whether you're not a Christian.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.120]   It can be said of us, "Yes, you are.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   You are not.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   You are right.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.120]   You are wrong."
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.400]   The Apostle does that very thing.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:24.000]   And therefore I say that we must understand at the very beginning that this message and
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.240]   this gospel is something which can be put clearly and specifically.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.160]   It can be put in definitions.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.360]   We can criticize it.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.160]   We can say, "This is right.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   That is wrong."
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:45.040]   It is an exact knowledge with respect to the truth that it has to offer to us.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.440]   Now that is the very case which is made by the Apostle, and you remember that he puts
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:59.520]   it as strongly as this, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.400]   unto you than that which we have preached."
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.480]   Let the curse of God descend upon us as the Apostle.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.040]   Well, it's as definite as that.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:17.760]   There's the second principle, but let me hurry on to the third principle.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   It is a gospel.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:24.680]   It's a perfectly clear and plain and well-defined gospel.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.200]   It is the only gospel.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.680]   You notice again how he puts it.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.160]   I've already been quoting the verses.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.480]   It's in verses 6, 7, 8, and 9.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:43.880]   "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace of Christ,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:50.760]   and to another gospel which is not another, but there are be some that trouble you, etc.,
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.960]   and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.800]   But though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel than that which we have preached
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.120]   unto you, let him be accursed.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:06.040]   As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.920]   that which you have received, let him be accursed.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.560]   Let the curse of God come down upon his head."
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:24.160]   And what he means by all this is that this is the only gospel.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:29.360]   Now I know that I'm saying something that is hateful to the natural and to the modern
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:37.800]   man, but the apostle says it, the whole New Testament says it, I have to repeat it.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:42.480]   This gospel is exclusive.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.680]   It says that it alone is the gospel and that there is no other.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.120]   It makes an utter, absolutely unique claim.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.960]   This other, says the apostle, it's not a gospel, which is not another.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.360]   It's called a gospel, but it's not a gospel, says the apostle.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.800]   It is not, and indeed it cannot be.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.000]   Oh, I wonder whether we're all perfectly clear about this.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.280]   I ask my question because of my familiarity with the modern situation and so much that
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:23.200]   is being said, it's no use going on to consider the gospel unless we are clear about these
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.240]   preliminary matters.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.440]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not just one point of view amongst a number of points of
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   view.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   It is the only point of view.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.840]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is not just one of a number of philosophies that are offering
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:47.240]   themselves to men and women, it's not just one of a number of outlooks.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:52.040]   There are people who believe that it is, you know, they say, "I'm a great reader."
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.440]   Oh, yes, I've read your gospel, but I've read the philosophers, and I'm interested
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.800]   in all these insights into truth.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:06.040]   I'm charmed by all these inquiries into the realm of the unknown.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:12.440]   I've got a Catholic mind, I preserve an open mind, and I'm grateful for the way
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.880]   in which the gospel helps me.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.480]   Of course, it's not the only message, I'm interested in them all.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.040]   Now says Paul to such an outlook, "There is no other.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.120]   It isn't one of a series, it stands alone."
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:31.320]   Or let me put it in this form, "It's not even one of a number of religions."
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.440]   And this is very popular today, isn't it?
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.920]   I'm a student of religions, says the man.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.120]   I'm very interested in the teaching of Jesus, but I'm equally interested in the teaching
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:49.480]   of Confucius, and Buddha, and all, Mohammed, and all these great religious geniuses and
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.560]   teachers that have appeared amongst mankind throughout the running centuries.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.680]   And so, you see, they put it in amongst all the others as one of a number of religions.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   They say, "You mustn't say it's the only religion.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.940]   Who are you to claim that yours alone is right?
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.000]   Why not give a chance to the others?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.800]   Let's read them all, and let's pick out what's best in them all.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.960]   Let's have some kind of simplitism, some eclecticism, let's pick out all the insights
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:19.000]   and all the best understandings, and then we'll be greatly helped in our search for
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.680]   God and for truth."
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:33.080]   The Apostle's answer to all that is this, "There is no other gospel.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.280]   This alone is the gospel.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.240]   There are not many ways to God, there are not many ways to truth."
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.200]   The business of preaching is not to ask men to cultivate the open mind or to indulge in
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   free thought.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   No, no.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.280]   It is to proclaim this good news, it is to announce this message, it's to say to men
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:01.500]   and women, "This is the way, this is the only way, there is no other way."
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:07.160]   It is the message of one who stood before men and said, "I am the way, the truth and
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   the life.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.240]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.520]   I am the light of the world, and there is no other light."
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:23.320]   It's not an appeal, I say, for free thought or for an open mind.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:29.520]   It is to exhort men and women to believe this, to accept it, and to submit themselves to
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.960]   it.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.760]   And I say the apostle doesn't hesitate to use language which is as strong as this.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:45.440]   He says, "If I ever come amongst you and I say something that contradicts what I preached
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:53.720]   to you when I first came to you, I shall not only be preaching a lie, let the curse of
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.840]   God come upon me and strike me dead in your presence."
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.400]   "I don't care," says the apostle, "who else may come among you.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.560]   I don't care what his credentials are.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.240]   I don't care what his learning and his knowledge may be.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.520]   I don't care what sort of personality he's got.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.320]   I don't care how good a man he is.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.240]   If he denies what I preached to you, let the curse of God descend upon him and strike him
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   dumb and dead."
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:27.040]   And then the most daring thing of all, "I don't care," says the apostle, "if an angel
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.440]   from heaven should appear among you.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:39.600]   If he does, an angel from heaven, and he contradicts this message or detracts from it or waters
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.840]   it down or disputes it, I say, let the curse of God come upon him, though he's an angel,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.680]   and blast him out of existence."
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:53.320]   That's his language.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:40:05.040]   He says that there is no other gospel but this, and he will not tolerate any other suggestion.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.320]   And he does so, of course, because he knows perfectly well that there is nothing else
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.040]   that can deliver mankind.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:19.480]   The world had been trying to cure itself and to deliver itself long before this man, the
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.520]   apostle Paul, ever appeared.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.400]   That's the meaning of your Greek philosophy.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.520]   That's the meaning of all your civilizations and empires.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.220]   They're trying to heal the hurt of mankind.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.080]   They're trying to find a way of deliverance and of salvation.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:41.320]   They've all failed, and they all ever will fail, says Paul, and they're still failing.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.000]   That is why he doesn't hesitate to say that there is no other gospel.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.880]   He knows that in fact there isn't.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.960]   He knows that in practice there isn't.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.120]   He knows that all the teachings of men at their best and at their highest cannot deliver
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:41:00.240]   a soul, cannot reconcile a man to God, cannot cure the ills of the whole universe.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.600]   And the world tonight proves it.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.240]   This is the only gospel.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.500]   There is no other.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.120]   That other is not a gospel.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.320]   Very well, that brings me to my last point this evening, which is this.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.720]   I can imagine somebody saying to me, "You're making bold assertions.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:26.960]   You're repeating the language of that apostle Paul, and you're standing there and you're
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.200]   saying you've got to believe what I'm saying, and don't listen to anybody else.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   They're all wrong.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.600]   I alone am right.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.240]   Isn't this sheer arrogance?
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.840]   Isn't this pure intellectual arrogance?
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:44.040]   On what authority do you make this exclusive claim and this exclusive assertion?"
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:51.560]   Well, let me put it quite simply.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:57.880]   What I am preaching is not my idea, not my opinion.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.640]   I don't stand here to say I've thought about life, I've looked at it, I've analyzed it,
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.580]   and this is what I believe, this is the conclusion I've come to.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.580]   That isn't what I do.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.720]   I'm not called to do that.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.460]   I'm not trying to do that.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.760]   I'm not here to deliver my own opinions, my own thoughts.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   Well, what am I doing?
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:21.240]   Well, what I'm doing is expounding this New Testament.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.560]   I know nothing apart from this.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:33.880]   My whole position is based upon the authority of the apostles and prophets.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.320]   My message is the message that I get from this man Paul, from Peter, from John, from
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.200]   all these New Testament writers.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.880]   I know nothing apart from this.
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:49.080]   I'm not here giving you my own excogitations, my own imaginations, my own feelings, my own
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   insights.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   No, no.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.080]   I'm simply expounding.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.440]   I have nothing apart from this.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:43:04.240]   "Well, very well," says someone, "where did they get it from?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.360]   Why should you thus be slavishly tied to them?
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.480]   Who is this apostle Paul who speaks in this manner and who says that the curse of God
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.400]   must descend upon any man who disagrees with what he has preached?
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.360]   What right has he to say so?
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.480]   On what basis and authority does he make his assertions?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.920]   Well, listen to him.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:33.000]   He answers us very plainly and very simply.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.320]   He tells us that what he preached was not his idea either, that he wasn't giving expression
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.400]   to his own thoughts.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.680]   He makes it quite plain to us in many places that he had had his own thoughts.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.280]   He says, "I verily believe with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.800]   name of Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.440]   That was his own thinking, but he's stopped that.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:03.560]   He's now giving this, not his own opinions, not his own ideas.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.520]   Indeed he tells us here that what he was preaching he was not even taught by other people.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.200]   He says, "I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:21.160]   after men, for I neither received it of men, neither was I taught it by men."
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.120]   He's not like a parrot repeating what somebody else has said.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.720]   He's not a gramophone record.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.960]   He isn't passing on a message that other men have thought out.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.240]   He's not the purveyor of other people's philosophies.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.000]   Well, what is it then?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.680]   What is it that enables this man to dare to venture to use such extraordinary language?
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.120]   What is it that puts the man into the position of saying, "If he does not preach my gospel,
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.600]   let him be accursed"?
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   What is this?
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.120]   "Oh," says someone, "it's a marvelous experience that he's had."
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   Well, it is in a sense, and in another sense it isn't, for the apostle wasn't preaching
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.340]   his own experience.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:08.840]   His teaching is not an attempt to put into words an experience which he's had.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   No, no.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.360]   He tells us quite plainly here, "I neither received it of men," he says, "neither
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:22.920]   was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.080]   That's the explanation.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.680]   That's why he speaks with authority.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.160]   That's why he makes this bold assertion.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:35.400]   That's why he calls down the curse of God upon a man who denies his message.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.760]   "I have got it," he says, "by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.160]   And what does he mean by that?
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.320]   Well, you remember the story.
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:55.480]   This was the man who was going to Damascus to exterminate Christianity.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:02.000]   When the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him on the road and spoke to him, and gave him
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.480]   the message, gave him the revelation, he said, "I'm going to make you a minister and
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   a witness.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.520]   I'm going to send you to the people and to the Gentiles, and I want you to preach
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   this message."
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.880]   He says, "It isn't mine.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   I never thought it.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880]   I hated it.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   I disliked it.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880]   The Lord of glory gave it me.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.360]   I've got it by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.280]   It wasn't the apostles who gave it me.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.320]   It wasn't any man who gave it me.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.000]   Christ himself gave it me."
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.720]   And of course, this is what he discovered later, that everything that the Lord had given
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.080]   to him, he had given to the others also.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.880]   In the second chapter he tells us that when finally he went up to Jerusalem to meet the
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.400]   other apostles, he said, "I found that I was preaching exactly the same thing as they
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   were.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.680]   There was no difference at all.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:50.720]   What Christ had given me, he'd given them.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.680]   We were all saying the same thing.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.920]   I wasn't one of the original apostles, but Christ gave it me, the revelation of Jesus
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   Christ."
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:11.600]   Oh, this is why we claim that this is unique, and that it is the only gospel.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:18.280]   Did you notice how he starts off in verse 1, Paul, he says, "An apostle, not of men,
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:30.120]   neither by men, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from the dead."
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.760]   Why do I stand here and say that this alone is gospel?
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.720]   Why am I not here preaching the teachings of Confucius, and Mohammed, and Buddha, and
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.720]   the rest?
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.800]   Why don't I invite you and say this to you, "Tonight, I'm giving you Jesus Christ's
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   view.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.680]   Come next week, I'll give you Confucius.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.920]   Come the following week, I'll give you Buddha.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.840]   Come the next week, I'll give you Mohammed.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.840]   Come the next week, I'll give you Plato.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.760]   Come the next, I'll give you Socrates."
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.200]   Why don't I do that?
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.520]   I'll tell you why.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.760]   It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.520]   It's God.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:10.480]   All these are men, great men, I'll grant you, great thinkers, excellent teachings as
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.920]   far as they go.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.560]   But this doesn't belong to them.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   Why?
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   This is from God.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:25.360]   This is the Lord Jesus Christ, whom God raised from the dead.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:31.680]   That's why I tell you that this is unique and exclusive.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:39.640]   That is why I tell you that this alone is the gospel, and this alone can save.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.160]   Men have done their best, they've thought, they've tried to scale the heights, they've
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:51.600]   tried to discover the ultimate truth, but they cannot, not one of them.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.320]   What have we here?
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.960]   Who is this Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:03.200]   "Well," says Paul, "he's one whom God has raised from the dead, the only one that God
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.840]   has ever raised from the dead.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.880]   Here is one who's been in the world and he's taught.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.680]   He was crucified on a tree.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.120]   He died, they buried him, they rolled a stone on the grave.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.120]   He rose!
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:19.080]   He burst asunder the bends of death.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.920]   He appeared unto men, they saw him ascending unto heaven.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   Resurrection!
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   Who is he?
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:29.840]   Son of God.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.560]   That is why this is unique and the only gospel.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.840]   It's not men trying to discover God.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:47.800]   It's God sending his own Son out of heaven and out of eternity into this world of time.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.680]   And it's only happened once.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:55.800]   There is only one eternal Son, and he is Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:01.760]   He's alone, the only God-man, God in the flesh, the Word made flesh.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.200]   There he is in all his uniqueness and his glory.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:11.100]   And this is the good news, that into the world that couldn't find God, amongst the philosophers
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:16.680]   that didn't know him, in a world that was wretched and going astray, into this, God
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.580]   has sent his only Son.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:28.520]   As this apostle goes on to say in chapter four of this same epistle to the Galatians,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:39.560]   "When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman made
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.120]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law."
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.240]   My dear friend, is there news like that?
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.040]   Is there anything comparable to it?
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:53.640]   That God has done this unique thing into the whole of history, lived on the human level.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:03.280]   Come came the Son of God as the babe of Bethlehem, and he came to save.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:13.040]   Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.160]   He came to save.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:21.320]   And he saved, as the apostle tells us, and as God willing, I'm going on to expound to
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:27.120]   you on subsequent Sunday evenings, he saved by giving himself.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:35.400]   And so, delivering us from this present evil world, he came to die, to take our problem,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:42.840]   our sin, our shame, our iniquity upon himself, and bear its burden, and bear it all away.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:49.000]   And so, he reconciles us to God, and makes us children of God, and lifts us out of the
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:58.600]   world, and delivers us from its evil, malign influence, and saves us to all eternity.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:04.680]   There can't be an alternative to this.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.880]   There is no second gospel.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.600]   I don't need your Confucius.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.320]   I don't need your Buddha.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.880]   I don't need your Muhammad.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.600]   I don't need your philosophers at this point.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   What can they do?
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.760]   The Son of God has done it all.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:33.120]   "Yea, all I need in thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come, plenteous grace in thee is
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.080]   found, grace to cover all my sin.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:43.360]   Let the healing streams abound, make me, keep me pure within.
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:50.480]   Thou of life, the fountain-heart, freely let me take of thee, spring thou up within my
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.600]   heart, rise to all eternity."
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:58.300]   My friend, did you know this good news?
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.300]   Have you thrilled to it?
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:01.880]   Have you realized that that what it is?
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.560]   Not just that you should be a better man, or a better woman, a better young man, a better
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   young woman.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   That isn't Christianity.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:17.940]   It's to tell you that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:26.320]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.980]   Have you got it?
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.480]   Have you received it?
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.920]   Haven't you realized that this is the most amazing, astounding, the most thrilling message,
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.280]   the most wonderful good news that has ever entered the world?
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.780]   Is it that to you?
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:47.240]   If not, I say, awaken, it's happening.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:57.520]   It's the way God has taken to save men, and therefore it is the only way.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.840]   And if you are not saved by it, you are lost.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:11.960]   Awake I say, arise, consider it, look at him, Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ, raised from
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:20.520]   the dead, Son of God, the Savior of the world.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:28.200]   Oh, yes, the Apostles write, and I repeat his words, "Though we are an angel from heaven,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.440]   preach any other gospel unto you than this."
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:38.680]   Let him be accursed, it's a lie, it isn't true.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:45.800]   This is the gospel, and it's clear, it's plain, it's about Jesus Christ, Son of God, his death,
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.800]   his burial, his resurrection, his atonement.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.840]   Come, let's look into it together, but don't wait.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:02.400]   If you haven't seen that Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God, and that he came into
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:11.040]   the world to save people like you, and that he alone can do it, I say realize it now.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:18.680]   He gave himself for us, that he might deliver us from this present evil world as he delivered
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   you.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.640]   Do you know him?
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.080]   Do you know in your heart that the Son of God has loved you and has given himself for
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.680]   you?
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:34.640]   Look at him tonight, I say, believe it and believe on him, tell him so, thank him, give
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:42.880]   yourself to him, and you'll know that he is the one he claims to be, and you'll enjoy
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:46.260]   his amazing deliverance.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:53.120]   Do it now, amen.
