[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.040]   All right, we have a question here from Mr. Academia.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.400]   He asks, "As a computer scientist, are you so good you can't be ignored? And if not,
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   does it bother you?" Well, you know, it's a hard question. It does bother me. But it's a hard
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.920]   question, because in any field with an elite competitive structure, the question of what is
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:38.480]   good is a squirrely one, because there is almost always levels above whatever you grab, whatever
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.640]   you fix, as this is good. It's all super relative. It really depends who you fix to. So I don't know
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.880]   the answer to this question. It depends who you anchor to. So let me give you both arguments.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.680]   Let me give you the argument that, "No, I'm not." The argument, "No, I'm not," is,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.560]   well, look, you're not at a top 10 computer science department. There is no major theorem
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:12.880]   that has been solved that has your name on it. That's true. In recent years during the pandemic,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.560]   your publication dried up. You wouldn't see that with a really top computer scientist. You had
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.880]   other things going on, and that kind of dried up. There are certain very competitive grants that I
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.680]   don't have. I don't have an NSF career grant. So I could make an argument pretty quickly
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.240]   that I'm a bust. Now let me go the other way. Let me go the other way.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.200]   Look, you came out of Dartmouth sort of guns blazing, A's in everything, went to MIT,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.320]   like the number one place in the world, breezed through your doctorate there, got A's in all of
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.040]   your classes, were publishing left and right at MIT, got a really good tenure track academic job
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.480]   at a top 25 US university in sort of exactly the narrow geographic band in which you wanted to live.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.040]   Once at that university, you published a lot, you got tenure early, you went up for tenure
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.920]   after just four years, you were named a Provost Distinguished Associate Professor Scholar,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   you have 70 peer-reviewed papers and over 3,000 citations on those papers, an H-index of 30.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.480]   Compared to most people who study computer science, "Oh, you're a tenured professor who
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.360]   has all these publications." Both of those things could be true. Those are both accurate assessments
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   I gave. So honestly, it really depends on the day whether I feel really good or really bad.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   If I'm hanging out with some of my old MIT buds that are just killing it, I feel essentially
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.640]   like I'm a fourth grader who wandered into the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. But then other
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.240]   times I'm around my students or this or that, and I'm like, "Oh yeah, look at all these ideas I came
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   up with, these theorems that I cracked, these new techniques, these NSF grants I've gotten,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.400]   and I feel really good." So it's really hard. It's really hard in fields with elite competitive
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.120]   structures. And so it just goes back and forth. The same thing with writing. I mean, I could do
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.320]   the same thing with writing. Depends on the day. I have friends who have sold book amounts that
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.960]   boggle the mind, like more than, well, not more than, say eight figures, eight figures worth of
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   books, right? Lots of books. Made a fortune. And I have friends who are award-winning,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.120]   notable book, major awards, including at least one Pulitzer winner. So I can look there and be
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.960]   like, "What the hell am I doing as a writer? I'm nothing. I'm nobody." Or I could look the other
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.840]   way and be like, "Hey, I have seven books and write for The New Yorker and a bunch of New York
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.960]   Times bestsellers. And I make a lot of best of the year lists. Those aren't easy to make. I think
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.400]   email will be on the Times of London's best of the year list. It's on the Financial Times best
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   of the year list. It's on Amazon's best of the year list. Like, hey, I'm writing books that sell
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   a ton of copies, relatively speaking, and are on best of year books." Or then I look over here and
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   say, "They don't have a Pulitzer and it didn't sell 10 million copies, so it's nothing." So I
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.560]   guess my point here, Mr. Academia, is that it all just depends what you're measuring against.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:26.640]   So probably the right strategy is to stop trying to actually get a definitive answer and shift over,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.440]   like I try to do on my good days, towards lifestyle-centric, value-driven career planning.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.720]   This is what I want my life to be like. These are the things I value. I value the craft of writing.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.920]   I value the craft of the computer science I do. Here's what I want my life to be like. And try
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:49.600]   to get as much satisfaction as I can out of the execution of this plan, of the realization
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.800]   of this idealized lifestyle, and try less to put myself up on a scoreboard and say,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.120]   "I just fell from seven to nine. Now I'm upset." I don't succeed
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.320]   in that mindset shift all the time, but it's what I try to do.
