[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.800]   - Good morning, Radicals.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.620]   Happy Monday to you,
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.360]   and welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.680]   the show dedicated to providing you
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.320]   with the knowledge, skills, insight,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.620]   and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.120]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.640]   Today, we're gonna talk about insurance,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800]   practical, (laughs)
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.140]   practical insurance.
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.920]   If you're anything like me,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.020]   perhaps you've been fascinated and,
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.180]   not sure the right adjective to use.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.040]   I was gonna say impressed,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.780]   but that makes it sound positive.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.960]   Just fascinated and,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.300]   I don't wanna use horrified,
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.640]   'cause that's just far too strong.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.640]   Interested, let's just go with interested.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   If you're anything like me,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.120]   you've been interested to watch
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.960]   the unfolding disaster in Houston, Texas right now,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.840]   and all throughout that part of Texas
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920]   with the impact of Hurricane Harvey.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160]   And it seems as though the situation is bad
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.960]   and just simply getting worse.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440]   Perhaps most dramatic,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   simply because of the number of people affected.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.760]   Houston, of course, being about the fourth largest
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.800]   metropolitan area in the United States
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.640]   and being deeply, deeply impacted.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.920]   And talk about a huge disaster
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.240]   when you have this many people affected by a disaster,
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.120]   you can get wall-to-wall coverage.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.160]   And so I've been fascinated,
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.920]   love the world that we live in
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.240]   with the access to the internet
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.800]   to be able to pull up the local live streams
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   from the TV stations.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.440]   I've been watching that over the weekend.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.120]   And I thought it'd be helpful to share with you
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.480]   just some simple ideas that may be of use to you
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.680]   as you consider a disaster.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.380]   Very little of this will be helpful
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.320]   to listeners in Houston or the surrounding area,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280]   but my intent is to help all the rest of us
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.000]   who are not in that specific situation.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.840]   Anytime you hear about a disaster or hear about a problem,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.480]   I think it's very helpful to use the circumstances
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.060]   that you hear about or the circumstances that you watch
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.040]   and think through your own situation.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.320]   Chances are you're not gonna face the same disaster
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.200]   that somebody else faces,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.060]   but by thinking through the disaster
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.800]   that somebody else is facing,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.760]   you will be able to consider solutions to it.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.680]   And because you're not experiencing the emotional weight
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.440]   and the emotional trauma
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   of seeing your house filled up with water
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.320]   or seeing all of your things blown out the door
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.160]   in a hurricane or a tornado,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   you can think a little bit more dispassionately
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.080]   and logically.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.800]   And by thinking about it,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.160]   when you're not facing the emotional trauma
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.720]   of the situation, you'll be better prepared to face it
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.200]   when it happens to you.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.360]   Now, of course, most of the disasters
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.940]   that face other people will not happen to you.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.960]   Your disaster will be unique.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.900]   But if you go through and list out the common disasters
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.560]   that we face, whether they're due to inclement weather
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   or not, most of the time you wind up with a suite
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.860]   of common solutions for those disasters.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.280]   There are fundamental principles that will apply
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.920]   regardless of the actual causative event.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.000]   In many ways, facing personal financial crisis
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.280]   due to a job loss has a tremendous commonality
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.460]   of solution with facing the death of a family member
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.160]   or with a flood in your home or a hurricane or a blizzard
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.200]   or an earthquake or any other number of disasters,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.920]   a forest fire, any of those types of things.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.940]   There is some common, there's just some common things
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.260]   that we need as human beings, and we all have similar needs.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.900]   And so when you start to address these needs
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.560]   and you do it in a diversified way,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.960]   you can build up for yourself a strong
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.620]   and resilient platform to move from.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.240]   This, of course, may ultimately save your life
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.740]   when you face a disaster.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.260]   Even if the impending threat is not life-threatening,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.540]   it will hopefully allow you to pass through a difficult time
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.180]   and turn a crisis into a nuisance
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.420]   and help you to come through it in a stronger place.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.580]   And most likely what will happen
[00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580]   is because you come through in a stronger place,
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.660]   then you can help someone else from a place of strength.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.780]   And that's the goal of thinking through things.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.140]   We want to build resilient households and strong households
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.840]   so that we can be of use to those who are close to us
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.140]   and be of use to our neighbors.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.940]   This is in many ways the paradox of good planning.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.260]   When you plan well and you plan
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.220]   and implement good financial planning for yourself,
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.980]   chances are you probably won't need it
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.220]   'cause again, you turn things
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.500]   that would otherwise be a crisis
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.860]   into something that's perhaps
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.380]   most accurately called a simple nuisance.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.020]   And that's a consistent process that can be applied.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.900]   But in watching the events that have unfolded
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.060]   in Houston this last weekend,
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.180]   I thought it'd just be helpful for me
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.220]   to give you some practical, thoughtful solutions
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.220]   as I've considered the disaster
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.300]   that many millions of people there are facing.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.460]   And as I've used that disaster to think through my own plans
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.660]   for facing such a disasters.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.060]   Living here in Florida, I'm very familiar with hurricanes
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.220]   and have been of course for many years.
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.580]   And in the past, I used to be involved
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.460]   with some of the volunteer organizations
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.460]   for disaster management and hurricane preparation, et cetera,
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.820]   primarily for years as an amateur radio,
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.980]   I still am, but as an amateur radio operator
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.020]   and would go and volunteer in the Red Cross shelters
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.260]   and been through a number of hurricanes with that,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.140]   a bunch of friends in public safety
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.540]   and the emergency operation centers, et cetera.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.780]   So I've thought through a lot of these things
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.100]   for a long time and I'm pretty familiar
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.060]   with hurricanes and hurricane planning.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.260]   So let me share with you some very practical bits of advice
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.240]   that I hope will help you.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.540]   First lesson that I think is very apparent
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.100]   from Hurricane Harvey in Houston this weekend
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.900]   and this week is that in most disasters,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.340]   the best solution is to leave,
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.180]   to get out of there long in advance.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.040]   If at all possible, you don't ever wanna show up
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.500]   on a TV screen, you don't wanna show up
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.940]   and have some dramatic footage being captured
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.740]   of you going out on a boat.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.420]   Now, thankfully, if you're in that circumstance,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.180]   you're being helped and you're gonna live.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.060]   And thankfully, the loss of life so far has been minimal.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.360]   It's one of the benefits of living
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.220]   in a strong, structured society, such as Texas,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.780]   as compared to other places in the world.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.900]   It's heartbreaking sometimes to be in other places
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.060]   where just simply the houses are built so poorly
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.380]   that a simple windstorm can come through
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.640]   and destroy houses, kill people within those houses,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.980]   cause a mudslide coming down the mountain
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.140]   and hundreds of people are buried.
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.300]   This is a common occurrence throughout the world.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.340]   We just don't hear that much about them in Western media.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.520]   But if you start traveling a little
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.100]   or pay attention to the global events
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.980]   that are outside of the Western context,
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.140]   oftentimes you'll see that this is a regular occurrence.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.660]   So thankfully, the loss of life so far has been minimal.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.500]   But you don't ever wanna be in that boat,
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.880]   nor do you wanna be in those floodwaters.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.460]   You don't want to be facing the TV crew
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.620]   that's outside your house showing your wind blown off
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.820]   and your roof blown off by the wind.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.000]   And the reason is you wanna be gone from the disaster zone.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.700]   In the vast majority of disasters that can happen,
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.660]   the best solution for you to come through it well
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.660]   is to leave and to leave in advance.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.220]   Now, in order to be able to leave in advance successfully,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.360]   you'll need to be prepared to go a little bit early.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.820]   Better a little bit early and wrong,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.260]   meaning it wasn't as bad as you thought,
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.260]   than late and facing serious problems.
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.660]   It's very frustrating to be stuck in long lines of traffic
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.700]   and in crowds of people.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.740]   It's frustrating and it can be dangerous.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.780]   It can turn what, at the very least,
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.500]   if you're stuck in a long line of people
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.660]   in a massive traffic jam on the interstate,
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.420]   it will turn what usually was interesting
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.620]   and perhaps scenic two or three hour drive out of town
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.900]   into a frustrating 12 hour event.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.900]   This last week, I went up and viewed the solar eclipse
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.980]   from within the 100% band
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.420]   up north of where I live here in Florida.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.800]   And my intention and goal was to come out of there
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.260]   as quickly as possible.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.260]   So I had planned ahead to be very close to the interstate
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.760]   and basically that the eclipse was over
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.180]   and I was going to just jump on the interstate
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.740]   and get home as quickly as possible.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.000]   Well, of course, millions of other people had the same idea
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.280]   and I was prepared for that.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.140]   I knew that was the probable outcome.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.320]   So I had full tank of gas, et cetera.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.640]   But even so, it was such a frustrating scenario to be in
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.780]   where I was sitting there
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.980]   and waiting with millions of other people
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.300]   just sitting on a highway.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.480]   It took me about five or six hours
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.460]   to go about 70 to 75 miles home
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.260]   till finally I just abandoned it
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.760]   and said, "This is ridiculous,"
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.540]   and quit and drove home the next day with empty roads.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.720]   But in order for you to be able to leave in advance
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   of other people, you'll need to be planned.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.420]   What causes most people to just not to act
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.980]   is either they lack the resources to act,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.340]   this happens and affects many, many poor people,
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.260]   people who they have to go to work
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.180]   and if they don't get that one day of work,
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.280]   then they're going to not make their bills
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.100]   or they don't have the money
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.980]   to be able to put gas in their vehicle to get out of town.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.660]   You watch any kind of hurricane coverage
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.860]   and you'll often see this.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.300]   The news will find and go to a trailer park
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.640]   or interact with poor people
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.260]   and they just don't have the resources set aside
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.780]   to get out of town.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.540]   And so they make unwise but desperate decisions
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.100]   often to stay in inadequate housing
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.140]   and simply because they lack the resources
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.980]   to get out of town.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.300]   So that's one thing.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.860]   If you lack those resources,
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.080]   then do everything else we talk about in other shows
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.260]   and put those resources in place
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.460]   so that you can have gasoline to get yourself out of town.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.220]   It requires planning and preparation.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.220]   But the other thing that keeps people
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.660]   from moving out of town is just lack of decisions,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.780]   lack of being sure about what to do
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.900]   and thinking through the alternatives
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.140]   and think, I don't really want to go out of town.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.140]   So the key is to think through your plans in advance.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.940]   Which direction would you go?
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.620]   Start with a plan of how,
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.700]   if you need to get out of town
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.060]   to escape a hurricane or a blizzard
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.280]   or something that's a flood, a potential flood event,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.900]   put through a plan for you to go
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.820]   in all four cardinal directions
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.500]   from your place of residence.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.900]   If you live in the middle of the US,
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.940]   that helps helpful for me.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.100]   I can't do four cardinal directions
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.820]   because I run into an ocean.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.060]   But think through and sit down with a map
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.740]   and try to figure out which directions you would go.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.060]   Of course, the best opportunity
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.100]   is to stay with friends or family members if possible.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.380]   So if you sit down with a map
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.900]   and you look east, west, north, and south of you
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.040]   and think, what friends or family members do I have
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.700]   that are a few hours away?
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.200]   And make notes of those people.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.160]   If you have that, then getting out of town
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.320]   could be relatively simple.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.680]   It's a matter of saying, well,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.760]   worst case scenario is we go
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.960]   and spend a few days with some friends.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.160]   That'll probably be enjoyable.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.760]   It'll cost us a little bit of money and gas,
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.800]   but it won't be a huge financial cost
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.320]   and it won't be a huge burden.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.600]   It wasn't a really bad scenario.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.260]   And if you talk with those family members
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.060]   or friends in advance and let them know
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.340]   that that's on your list,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.020]   then that'll be even easier to make the call.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.140]   Hey, there's a hurricane coming.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.240]   Would you mind if we came and just stayed with you
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.340]   for a day or a couple of days to see how things shake out?
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.760]   If you don't have family members or friends
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.060]   in all four directions,
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.020]   I recommend that you pick a few towns
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.620]   that are 100 miles, couple hundred miles.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.220]   Usually that's enough to get significantly
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.220]   outside of where you are.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.420]   Just think a tank of gas.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.260]   How far can you drive on a tank of gas?
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.020]   Usually most vehicles is about 400 miles.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.580]   And choose a few hotels that are reasonable,
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.500]   comfortable, inexpensive hotels.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.500]   Write down those hotel names and the phone numbers.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.460]   And that way, if you decide,
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.980]   you know what, we're gonna get out of town,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.180]   you pick up the phone and you call the phone number
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.740]   for the Holiday Inn that's three hours north of you.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.740]   Give them your credit card number
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.000]   and make a reservation right away
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.860]   before they start getting hordes of evacuees
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.360]   coming in and filling up all the rooms.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.860]   Make your reservation, get yourself the hotel room
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.740]   and hit the road.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.240]   These things are not that destructive
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.500]   or intrusive on your lifestyle,
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.540]   especially if you can work it out with employment.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.820]   If I were facing this situation
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.660]   and I had a job that I needed to do,
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.500]   I would, and I had to be in one place,
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.860]   I would seriously consider,
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.980]   especially at this point in my life
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.780]   where I have three young children and two dogs,
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.780]   I would seriously consider saying,
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.940]   hey, just for safety and make my wife's life easier
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.020]   with three young children,
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.700]   let me have her head up to the hotel
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.940]   or let me have her head over to our friend's house
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.160]   and I'll stay and do the work.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.900]   And if nothing else, she can come home in a day or two.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.980]   This is a simple and easy plan,
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.260]   but most people don't think it through
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.180]   and they don't write down those names and phone numbers.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.540]   Doesn't cost you anything.
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.300]   Just write down the names and phone numbers
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.260]   of your family and friends
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.120]   and keep it someplace where you'll know
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.420]   that those papers are so that you can,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.700]   when surveying the information that's coming,
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.960]   you can say, let's go ahead and hit the road.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.420]   You wanna be able to leave quickly
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.420]   before the crowds of people start filling up the roads.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.420]   That probably means you wanna be able to leave quickly
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.420]   before any official voluntary evacuation
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.700]   or mandatory evacuations are ordered
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.420]   by the local governing officials.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.940]   I believe it's valuable to listen
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.140]   to your local emergency operations officials.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.380]   They have a serious job and they take it very seriously.
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.900]   All they do is think about how they can protect their town
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.280]   and put contingency plans in place
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.340]   for the residents of their town.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.460]   Again, I have a number of friends
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.960]   that I've interacted with personally
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.660]   who work in the emergency operations systems
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.380]   here where I live.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.540]   But I believe a little bit of healthy skepticism
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.020]   is in order.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.840]   Maybe not skepticism of people's intentions,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.920]   but recognize that you probably don't want
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.640]   to be part of the masses.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.800]   The biggest challenge that emergency operations people face
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.620]   is they have to deal with hordes of people
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.960]   and they're unlikely to want to move quickly
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.480]   because they know that any word they say
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.160]   is going to affect hundreds of thousands
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.500]   or millions of people.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.440]   Simple example is watch what has happened here in Houston
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.720]   this past weekend.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.580]   The emergency operations people,
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.040]   the Houston mayor and his staff,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.440]   declined to recommend evacuation.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.300]   The Texas governor strongly hinted at evacuation,
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.040]   but the local mayor declined to order evacuation.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.280]   Well, why did the local mayor decline to order evacuation?
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.520]   Because he didn't think that there was going to be an impact
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.800]   on their local area?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.040]   No, the emergency operations people knew
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.980]   that there was going to be a serious weather impact
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.820]   on their area.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.100]   They were well aware of it.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.060]   Houston has a long history of flooding.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.780]   This storm was uniquely set up to be very destructive
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.340]   with regard to flooding and they knew this.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.440]   The reason they didn't want to do this
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.480]   because they didn't want to order a couple,
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.120]   three, four million people out onto the roads all at once
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.280]   and wind up with another disaster of people
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.560]   sitting on the highways as it happened in previous storms.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.320]   And so they're trying to balance the needs
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.360]   of masses of people, but you're not masses of people.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.560]   You're an individual.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.240]   So listen to the officials, but don't wait on them.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.380]   Don't be with the masses of people.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.200]   The masses of people sometimes works out,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.400]   usually it doesn't.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.680]   I would generally always have a little bit of skepticism
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.140]   or I would read between the lines
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.000]   when listening to the local officials.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.720]   If you're on a barrier island and a hurricane
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.960]   is coming your way and they issue you
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.880]   a mandatory evacuation, be smart and leave.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.160]   But if you recognize that they're moving in that direction,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.860]   but they're hedging a little bit,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.680]   just to wait and figure out exactly what they're going to do,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   hit the road.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.840]   Now, when you leave, you need to be able to take the things
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.800]   with you that you need and you need to think this through
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.240]   in advance.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.480]   So here's some practical ideas.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.260]   Your number one need is gasoline.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.400]   That's the biggest thing that you need
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.280]   to get out of town is gasoline.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.300]   Good practical way to do this is try to keep your car
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.400]   at least always partway full.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.200]   In the same way that we don't spend our money
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.360]   down to the last dollar waiting for the next paycheck
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.600]   to come in and we don't drain our checking
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.020]   and savings accounts down to nothing,
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.880]   don't drain your gas tank down to nothing.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.340]   If you're the one who has a habit of driving
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.040]   until the last 16th of the tank
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.340]   and the little orange light comes on on the dash
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.560]   and then looking for a gas station, stop it.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.880]   Keep your car full of gas and reset your point of comfort
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.660]   to say half a tank.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.040]   Whenever you get to half a tank,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   stop and fill up the gas tank.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.380]   If you always have half a tank of gas in your car,
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.680]   that'll always give you usually about 200 miles
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.980]   out of town for most vehicles.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.240]   That'll get you away from most problems.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.620]   Remember, you don't want to be around the problems.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.260]   You might be hanging out in your house
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.340]   and Saturday morning and all of a sudden,
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.560]   there's some protest going on and all of a sudden,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.420]   people start rioting and protesting
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.540]   and you see the TV crews coming.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.500]   If you see the TV crews coming, get up and leave.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.940]   Don't do stupid stuff with stupid people in stupid places
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.880]   and mobs of people or it's a dumb place to be.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.780]   So always keeping gas in your car
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.160]   means you can get out of most problems.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.760]   Now, in addition to that, make sure you always store
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.380]   some gasoline at your house,
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.280]   at least enough to fill up your tank
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.900]   in case you neglected to fill it up,
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:59.960]   in case you wind up and you're down to an eighth of a tank
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.200]   and you need to get out of town but the waters are rising
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.080]   and the gas station storage tanks
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.000]   are starting to be contaminated with water.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.360]   You don't want to go down to that
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.000]   and get gas at that point in time.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.160]   You need to be able to get out of town
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.500]   and so you want to make sure that you store some gas
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.680]   at your home, at least one full tank's worth
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.220]   and anybody can do this.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.120]   Obviously, a simple and easy way to do it
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.380]   is get some gas cans.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.980]   Get some five gallon gas cans,
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.780]   four of them will be one tank worth for almost any vehicle.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:30.060]   Very safe, it's built for saving gas.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.780]   What I recommend is for safety,
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.380]   if you have an outbuilding, of course, that's superior.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.740]   In general, you want to minimize the gasoline
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.540]   that's stored in your house or near your house.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.160]   If there's a fire, it's better not to have
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.000]   an exploding closet full of gasoline,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.160]   although that risk is probably less than you might think.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.520]   If you have no other place to store it,
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.880]   you might store it in your closet
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.760]   but there's always options outside of that.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.280]   If you have a garage, store it in your garage.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.480]   If you have an outbuilding, store it in an outbuilding.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.520]   If you don't have an outbuilding,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.200]   go down to the home improvement store,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.840]   buy one of those little outdoor rubber made little things,
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.200]   shed things, storage cabinets or get one of those,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.340]   they call them deck boxes,
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.840]   that are designed for storing on a dock,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.760]   storing water gear, ropes, lines, things like that,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.140]   that are stored on a dock.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.000]   You pick up one of those, they're vinyl.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.580]   Another option would be some of these storage benches
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.820]   that it's a bench but it has a storage compartment
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.660]   underneath.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.300]   If you put a storage bench out in your garden
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.260]   and you put four or five gallon gas cans in there,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.300]   then that will be an effective way
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.080]   for you to always have some gasoline on hand.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.660]   Rotate it out, use it once a year,
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.060]   put some fuel treatment in there,
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.680]   either some Stabil, S-T-A-B-I-L, fuel stabilizer
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.700]   or some P-R-I-G fuel stabilizer in there
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.320]   and you can have gasoline in there
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.780]   that swap it out once a year and you'll be fine.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.400]   That'll be a great and easy way for you to save some gas.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.900]   And if you always have some gas on hand,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.140]   then you can get out when you need to.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.660]   Another option, of course,
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.940]   if you don't wanna use gas cans,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.080]   by the way, one simple thing that makes gas cans easy,
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.260]   especially if, for me, for example,
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.080]   my wife is not a large woman.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.120]   So the idea of her needing to gas up the car
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.280]   and manhandle a big five gallon tank of gas,
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.120]   especially with these new stupid carb compliant ones
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.040]   where the nozzles don't work and they're a pain,
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.320]   pick up a little 12 volt pump.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.040]   They sell a little 12 volt battery,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.100]   or nine volt, some of them work on little nine volt batteries
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.340]   or you can get 12 volt and hook it up to your car battery.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.480]   But still pick up a little pump
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.700]   that you can just put a pump into the fuel can
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.560]   and click it on, battery powered,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.720]   and use that to transfer the gas
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.720]   from the gas tank into the car.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.020]   Just keeping some gas handy, 20, 40, 50, 60 gallons.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.920]   Most people can do that pretty simply and easily.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.480]   And if you think creatively,
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.680]   you can store it in a safe way
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.280]   and it'll be available to you.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.900]   If you don't use it for an emergency, that's fine.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.960]   Now, once the gas starts to get a year old,
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.900]   take a little piece of tape,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.540]   write on it the date when it gets a year old,
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.500]   just dump it in your car,
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.060]   take it down to the gas station and get another tank of gas.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.820]   Another way that you can store fuel,
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.980]   this is of course never gonna be officially sanctioned,
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.460]   but it works perfectly fine,
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.540]   is you can buy some high, what's it called?
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.540]   High density polyethylene barrels or drums, HDPE drums.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.380]   This is the same stuff,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.680]   that's just the fancy name for the plastic,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.340]   that gas cans are made out of.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.640]   And so you can buy little 15 gallon drums,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.400]   you can buy 33 gallon drums,
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.500]   that would be the max 'cause it's gonna be so heavy.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.460]   Of course you could buy big 55 gallon drums,
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.600]   but it'd be so heavy that it'd be very hard to use.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.720]   But this is a simple way for you
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.640]   to store larger amounts of fuel.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.440]   And as long as you protect fuel from air
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.520]   and you make sure that it cannot evaporate
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.600]   and the air can't get in and get out,
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.200]   your fuel will last much,
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.920]   for a much longer period of time.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.280]   That's the number one thing that's important
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.320]   with fuel storage is not to allow it
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.960]   to have access to the air.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.780]   So get a little outdoor shed,
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.560]   get yourself some of these 15 or 33 gallon HDPE drums,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.560]   fill them up with gasoline
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.040]   and rotate them out every few years.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.160]   And you can protect yourself to be able to get out of town.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.680]   Remember at least one tank, whatever your car takes,
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.540]   at least one tank, that'll get you out of most problems,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.200]   get you out of most of the hard hit areas,
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.120]   it'll get you out of the flooding,
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.400]   it'll get you out of the hurricane zone
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.200]   where the power is out and the gas station pumps
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.880]   can't get the gas out of the tank.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.760]   It'll get you out of the lines of people
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.720]   so you can skip town.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.680]   That is priority number one, gasoline.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.460]   Priority number two is navigation.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.800]   How do you get from where you are to out of the area?
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.160]   So a couple of simple recommendations for you.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.280]   First, make sure that you always have
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.960]   some paper maps on hand.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.160]   When you're at the gas station,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.900]   at the local truck stop filling up your gas,
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.920]   when you're on a road trip,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.800]   pick up a map of your state and pick up an atlas,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.080]   one of these road atlases.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.040]   We are all getting so lazy with the convenience
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.080]   of our phones having constant free GPS.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.280]   And Google Maps and Apple Maps,
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.260]   these are phenomenal resources, but they have a fatal flaw.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:26.160]   And that's they require a good data connection to work.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   And also require a battery power.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.720]   But let's deal with the data connection.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.460]   I was interested when I was last week up watching the eclipse
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.260]   I'm interested in what happens
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.080]   when you have hordes of people moving together.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.860]   And especially when there are emergencies and evacuations
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.020]   and mass migrations of refugees.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.460]   It's always interesting to see what happens.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.060]   Now we've made tremendous progress
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.140]   in infrastructure advancements in the last decade.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.700]   Back in the mid 2000s,
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.460]   I was involved in a lot of local emergency communications.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.580]   And at that time when there would be a hurricane
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.040]   that would come through,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.180]   voice calls would have a hard time going through.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.100]   Text messages would usually get through pretty reliably,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.080]   but even there simple SMS messages weren't all that great.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.660]   If you go back to September 11, 2001,
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.680]   you think about what New York was like.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.760]   It was very difficult to communicate at that point in time.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.340]   The cell phone carriers have made tremendous progress
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.360]   in being prepared for disasters.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.000]   A lot of the local cell phone towers have backup power.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.180]   There's a lot more redundancy in the system
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.140]   and the cell phone carriers
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.580]   have large pre-prepared systems.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.580]   So what they call COWS, acronym for C-O-W-S,
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.460]   cellular on wheels, I think is what they calls for.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.340]   And when there's a hurricane coming,
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.780]   the large cell phone carriers will stage big trucks.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.520]   And as soon as they can get in after the disaster,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.060]   after the wind, they drop right in
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.740]   and start set up their towers
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.660]   and the cell phone systems are online quickly.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.780]   That means that voice calls and SMS messaging
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.780]   is remarkably robust now compared to what it used to be.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.700]   Data is not as robust.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.700]   And as our access to data has increased in quantity
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.580]   and decreased in price, we've started to use much more data.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.800]   So the way that many people are keeping in touch
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.740]   with one another is during a storm,
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.620]   is they're on Facebook, communicating with their friends,
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.860]   posting messages about what's going on.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.180]   Individual neighbors are on the Nextdoor app,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.400]   communicating with one another.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.500]   Here's what's going on in our neighborhood.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.260]   And so all of this requires data.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.340]   And amazingly, the data does a good job.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.280]   But the other thing that's dependent on data is GPS.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.980]   The GPS on your phone, whether it's Google Maps,
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.500]   Apple Maps, or Waze, that needs data
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.700]   in order to pull those maps in.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.820]   So immediately after the eclipse,
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.500]   I was testing the GPS systems and I was using my phone
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.300]   and I noticed and observed that for about 45 minutes
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.500]   after leaving the area of the eclipse
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.860]   when it was just so clogged
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.120]   and everyone was getting in their cars
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.220]   trying to navigate their way out,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.860]   the data would not work on my phone.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.740]   Waze, which is one of the GPS apps
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.900]   that is very popular now, W-A-Z-E, Waze,
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.300]   the Waze app would not load.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.420]   Waze is very popular because it uses real-time data
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.640]   from all of the users' cell phone devices,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.060]   positioning and speed recordings
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.720]   in order to try to have the computer map out
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.300]   the most efficient route out of the area.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.780]   And so as I observed kind of the massive traffic jam,
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.220]   many people were using Waze
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.780]   and trying to use it to get on the back roads.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.100]   When is it better to get on the back roads?
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.780]   When is it better to get on the highway?
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.460]   But it wouldn't work for about the first 30 to 45 minutes
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.020]   after the eclipse was over
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.620]   and everyone was trying to get out of town.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.060]   So you need to be prepared for this,
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.660]   whether the data signal is down
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.100]   because the towers are affected by a storm
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.460]   or because they're just down due to overclogging.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.940]   And there's two simple ways.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.060]   Way number one is have paper maps handy
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.700]   so you can navigate your way out of town.
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.820]   Way number two is have a GPS unit
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.300]   that is not connected to the cellular grid.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:30.340]   Get yourself a Garmin or a TomTom, that type of unit.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.980]   A cheap one is totally fine.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.420]   This business was destroyed by cell phone navigation systems
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.860]   and so you can pick up, for under 100 bucks,
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.500]   you can pick up a perfectly fine,
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.300]   brand new little Garmin GPS or TomTom GPS
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.620]   and these things work great.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.980]   And they're not dependent on the cell phone system.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.340]   They pull the GPS signals in from the satellite
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.780]   but they don't necessarily have to have the data connection.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.140]   Now, of course, there are fancy ones
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.100]   that will give you all the real-time traffic
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.260]   but you don't necessarily need one of those.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.800]   But if you think of trying to navigate out of Houston
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.100]   and trying to figure out your way
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.540]   around all the back roads,
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.020]   it is a lot easier if you have a GPS system
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.460]   that is pulling in the GPS signal
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.780]   and is constantly rerouting you.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.780]   You hit a roadblock with a river going across the road,
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.460]   you stop and you turn around and you move on to the next one.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.340]   So the map is helpful but the GPS and its ability
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.360]   to constantly update your routing is very, very helpful.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.180]   If you're doing that with crowds of other people,
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.460]   you might have a situation
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.060]   where the data signal doesn't work.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.980]   So protect yourself.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.140]   Pick up a couple of those GPSs.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:36.980]   They're cheap.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.800]   Keep one in each car.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.860]   That way, the cars are well-equipped
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.420]   and you'll have a good chance of being able
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.380]   to make your way out of town.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.620]   So number one need is gasoline.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.140]   Number two is navigation.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.880]   Number three is cash and access to money.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.500]   So one of the most valuable things you can do
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.200]   is just simply have cash.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.960]   Those who have cash can usually buy their way out
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.800]   of a problem area.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.420]   You may be able to stick out your thumb
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.500]   and hitch a ride down the road.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.480]   But if you can stick out your thumb
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.700]   with a $20 bill held behind it,
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.660]   you can hitch a ride a lot farther down the road.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.380]   Many times if somebody comes up to you in a gas station
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.820]   and propositions you for a ride,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.420]   if they can put some cash and say,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.700]   "Hey, I'm trying to get in this direction.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.900]   You're willing to give me a ride?"
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.200]   A lot easier to get a ride out of a trouble spot.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.600]   So keep cash handy.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.740]   Keep cash in your wallet.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.280]   Keep cash secreted in your vehicle.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.880]   Keep cash secreted in your house.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.240]   Keep cash in a strong box tucked away.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.060]   Keep cash somewhere close by.
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.860]   But you should be able to put your hands on 1,000 bucks
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:38.700]   whenever you need to.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.580]   And 1,000 bucks will get you and your family out of town.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.060]   So at a very minimum, if you are affluent,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.180]   make sure that you protect yourself still farther
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.260]   and have access to cash.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.660]   When the electricity is down and the ATM machines
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.080]   aren't working and the credit card machines aren't working,
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.020]   cash is king.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.760]   Cash is always king.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.100]   Also have access to money
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.520]   that may or may not be in your checking account.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.500]   So it's good to keep a couple of credit cards
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.580]   that are empty and have decent balances available.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.320]   So if you need to make that hotel reservation,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.320]   you just simply pull out the credit card,
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.420]   make the hotel reservation and hit the road.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.660]   So you need to have money available to you.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.060]   With that, gasoline to get you out of town,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.180]   navigation to navigate your way out of town,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.860]   and money to pay your way out of town,
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.380]   you can get out of the vast majority of problems.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.940]   Now there are, of course, a few more very simple
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.820]   and practical things that should be considered.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.320]   Water is next.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.900]   You should always have some water available.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.980]   And if you're loading up the car,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.520]   you should be able to load up some water.
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.760]   Simple and easy.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.400]   Go to the warehouse supply store,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.240]   Sam's, Costco, BJ's, whatever you use.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.680]   Pick up a bunch of packs of the 24 packs of water bottles.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   They're four bucks a piece for 24,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   actually they're 24 bottles of water.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.280]   Stack up a bunch of those in a corner closet somewhere.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.120]   The great thing about it is it's inexpensive,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.080]   it's easy, and it's divisible.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.160]   So instead of dealing with something
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.680]   like a five gallon bottle of water that's hard to move
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.820]   and that requires you to be pretty strong to move
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.660]   and how do you dispense it,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.300]   you've just got lots of little water bottles
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.340]   that you can use for drinking,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.920]   you can use for washing your hands,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.380]   you can use for brushing your teeth.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.820]   It's pretty easy to stack up 50 gallons of water bottles
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.060]   in the corner of your garage that's just ready to go,
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.460]   and it's just a tiny little stack
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.180]   and doesn't cost you very much money.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.540]   So have some water on hand.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.500]   Of course, consider having larger quantities of water
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.620]   at home, maybe a couple barrels of water
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.280]   in case things go down.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.920]   If you know, of course, the storm is coming,
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.060]   that's where you fill up other things with water,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.180]   but here I'm just primarily talking
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.060]   about getting out of town.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.060]   Keep some food on hand,
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.340]   some food that is easy to eat in the car.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.680]   It can be candy bars, it can be trail mix.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.280]   Just buy some packages of food
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.320]   that can get you out of town,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.240]   and then make sure that you're prepared
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:02.220]   with the important papers of your life brought together.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.220]   The important papers for yourself,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:08.180]   your birth certificates, your passports,
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.580]   for you, your children, marriage licenses,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.420]   insurance policies, things like that.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.980]   And make sure that you don't neglect important papers
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.140]   for your pets or any valuable items that you have,
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.920]   paperwork for the businesses that you own,
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.580]   or for the LLCs that you control,
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.860]   or for the family trust, copies of your will.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.820]   The pets are important.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.540]   You need to make sure that you remember
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.900]   to have vaccination certificates.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.140]   Simple example, the Red Cross,
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.520]   when you're taking your pet to a Red Cross shelter,
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.620]   they require that the pets
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.020]   have current vaccination certificates ready to go
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.520]   and able to be proved that they're vaccinated
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.620]   in order to let them into the shelter.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.080]   So make sure that those important papers
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.260]   are organized in a way that's simple to grab.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.100]   A filing cabinet is fine,
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.140]   but if you can't take your whole filing cabinet with you,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.300]   get yourself some kind of useful little way
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.580]   to transport papers,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.280]   and make a list of what you would need to grab
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.700]   if you needed to leave with your family.
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.020]   So write down the list, birth certificates,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:16.640]   passports, mortgage deed certificates, insurance policies,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.300]   and put with your filing cabinet
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.220]   one of those little folder, file holder things,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.700]   little plastic things that you can fill up with papers
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.180]   and toss it in a bag and hit the road.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.060]   Of course, a couple of other things that are convenient
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.100]   is things like having airbeds and sleeping bags
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.020]   and blankets and some extra clothes.
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.020]   If you're gonna go to your friend's house
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.440]   and you're gonna show up all of a sudden,
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.340]   they're probably not gonna have a lot of beds for you.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.220]   Of course, you can always sleep on a carpeted floor
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.860]   or on a wood floor if necessary,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.780]   but if you just grab a couple of cheap airbeds
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.580]   and you have those ready to toss in the car
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.760]   with some sleeping blankets and some clothes,
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.900]   that is going to make your life a lot easier.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.060]   Now, of course, you could take this and go beyond.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.160]   It's not a bad idea to have some bags
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.780]   that are pre-packed at any point in time.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.760]   Just go on the internet, start searching for,
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.700]   just search YouTube for bug out bag,
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.740]   and you'll find about a bazillion videos
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.820]   of people who take the subject extremely seriously.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.060]   Very impressive, some of the work that they do,
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.140]   to be able to go out and live on the road
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.140]   and have everything you could possibly need
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.860]   as time goes by.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.780]   That stuff's awesome.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.620]   I think it's cool.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:20.900]   It's fun to watch people who obsess about things like that.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.420]   Problem is, a little overwhelming and daunting
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.180]   to get there.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.460]   If you just do what I've just outlined for you,
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.460]   you cover gasoline, navigation, cash, water, food,
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.180]   important papers, something to sleep on,
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.300]   as part of food, make sure you remember medicines,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.860]   and you have a plan for making sure
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.380]   you have all your prescription medications
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.980]   if you use prescription medications.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.180]   That gets you 80% of the way there,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.660]   and those are some simple things to do.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.540]   That's all a matter of leaving,
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.620]   and if you leave quickly and early
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.740]   to get out of the problem area,
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.580]   you'll probably be well-served.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.260]   Now, here's one more list that you can and should make,
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.660]   and here's what's happening with Houston.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.020]   If I had been in Houston for the hurricane,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.060]   I probably wouldn't have evacuated for the hurricane
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.980]   because the chance of windstorm was low.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.700]   It wasn't gonna be a huge deal.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.340]   Biggest problem, of course, was the rain,
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.580]   and I don't know what it's like to live
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.420]   in a low-lying area.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.060]   I'm not a Houstonian where they deal
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.980]   with these floods all the time.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.820]   That, to me, is a unique situation.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.740]   You should think seriously
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.780]   before living in a place like that,
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.020]   but the biggest challenge of Houston
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.700]   has been the sheer volume of the water,
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.500]   and so even as I record this on Monday, August 28, 2017,
[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.060]   there are a lot of people whose houses
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.620]   haven't even necessarily been flooded
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.660]   or haven't been flooded much,
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.060]   and they're about to be flooded more
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:50.180]   because they're releasing water out of the reservoirs,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.620]   and this is flooding new neighborhoods,
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.760]   and they're doing it for the safety
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.940]   of massive numbers of the city,
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.900]   but if you're in a situation where you have more time,
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.860]   you're not trying to get out to beat the hordes,
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.380]   you should think through what you would do.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.820]   If you have more time, like a day or a couple of days,
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.020]   to pack up and go, what would you do
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.580]   and what wouldn't you do, and here's the other thing.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.780]   They're expecting, as of current forecast,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.020]   they're expecting that many of these houses
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.020]   will be filled with water for weeks.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.520]   That means the home will be uninhabitable for months.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.820]   That's a huge deal.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.500]   So if you had a little bit more time
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.980]   and you expected that you were going to need
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   to vacate your home for weeks or months,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.680]   then what would you do?
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.820]   Make this list.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.160]   Now this will be much more personalized to you.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.460]   You might have valuable property
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.020]   that you would want to make sure that you took with you.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.780]   Maybe you have valuable electronic equipment
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.580]   or valuable personal items that you wanted
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.180]   to make sure that you cared for.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.300]   If you think about this in advance,
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.620]   think about if you had to exit your home,
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.980]   let's say I give you a day,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.820]   a day and you got to get out of your house,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.720]   what would you do?
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.220]   Now the first thing you got to do is think,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.380]   what do I have that I want to protect?
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.080]   A couch might be not a big deal,
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.660]   but you might have an heirloom family piece of furniture
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.780]   that you'd like to protect.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   How are you going to get that out with you?
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.660]   It's obviously not going to go in your trunk.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.720]   So here's where we get to something like
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.340]   thinking ahead of the crowd and renting a U-Haul truck.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.720]   If you see something happening,
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.340]   is there a way that you might need to go
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.460]   and get a U-Haul truck?
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.040]   Or would it be a good preventive item?
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.600]   If I had to live in Houston
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.940]   and I were seeing this flooding on a screen,
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.820]   or if I lived in a low-lying city
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.620]   and I had valuable personal equipment,
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.020]   I would be considering doing something
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.540]   like renting a U-Haul truck in advance.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.820]   So it costs you a hundred bucks
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.740]   to have it in your driveway for a couple of days.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.580]   But if you had to evacuate, it could be worth doing.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.100]   Hard to do after they shut down,
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.700]   but it's just one idea I had as I was watching it.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.140]   You can't do it once they shut everything down,
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.140]   but if you could do it in advance,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.160]   or maybe pick up a U-Haul trailer,
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.940]   it's going to cost you 50 bucks to have it there,
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.340]   but you don't usually have a trailer.
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.180]   Well, in that situation,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.900]   you may be able to load things up and get out.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.460]   How would you get your stuff out and what would you take?
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.300]   So if you make some prioritized lists
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.480]   of what you would want or what you wouldn't want,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.540]   that'll get you probably the vast majority of the way
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.140]   through what you need to do.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.460]   Some people take this idea to the extreme
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.220]   and do practice load outs and figure out
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.980]   how they can pack all the stuff in their car.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.060]   That's cool if you want to do it.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.620]   I admire you for your hardcore-ness,
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.060]   but trying to give you some practical things
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.000]   that'll apply to most people.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.840]   So make some lists.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.980]   How would you prioritize?
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.140]   If a forest fire were heading your direction
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.620]   and you knew, "Hey, I needed to get out of here,"
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.220]   how would you prioritize the things
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.380]   that you needed to get out of your house?
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.780]   What would you take and what wouldn't you take?
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.620]   In a way, it's a matter of saying,
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.220]   if I had five minutes to get out of the house,
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.720]   how would I get out in five minutes?
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.060]   If I had an hour to get out of the house,
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.900]   how would I get out in an hour?
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.540]   And if I had 24 hours to get out of the house,
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:04.380]   what would I have?
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.340]   Most of the time, you get notification on stuff like this.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.480]   Flooding, fires, hurricanes.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:14.760]   You have often time to get out.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.820]   So make those lists and prioritize your personal items.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.060]   You don't always have time.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.260]   I was fascinated a couple years ago
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.380]   out in Colorado in Estes Park in the mountains,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.700]   they had serious flash flooding
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.940]   and I was fascinated to read several accounts
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.160]   of people who were awakened in the middle of the night,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.980]   knock on the front door by the local fire department
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.660]   saying, "You got five minutes to get out of here."
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.100]   They had five minutes to get out of the house
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.760]   and then their house was basically destroyed
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.220]   in the flash flood.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.620]   Or the Fort McMurray wildfires last summer up in Canada.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.000]   I watched a bunch of stories from people up there
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.620]   where they'd be sleeping, having a nap
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.460]   in the middle of the day.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.420]   And then the fire just start flowing through.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.240]   So there are times when you gotta get out in five minutes.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.380]   Think about it.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.620]   Couple of comments on insurance
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.580]   and we'll wrap up today's show.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.940]   Hope it's been helpful to you.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.380]   Obviously, when you see things that are flooded out,
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:09.380]   you should go back and consider the topic of flood insurance.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.220]   As hopefully you know,
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.940]   homeowner's insurance generally doesn't cover floods.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.880]   That's a separate policy.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.620]   I don't know how to advise you
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.840]   on what amount of insurance you should have.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.940]   I'm generally pretty skeptical
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.180]   on a lot of property and casualty insurance
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.180]   because the benefit of property and casualty insurance
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.460]   is you're insuring a specific property
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.700]   that can be, the value of which can be calculated.
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.820]   This is different than liability insurance.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.140]   And this is different than something that has major dollars
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.300]   like life insurance or health insurance.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.060]   The risks of life insurance, obviously,
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.940]   somebody dying can be catastrophic
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.500]   in terms of the lost income or health insurance.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   When you're insuring against a health cost,
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.440]   you're insuring against an unknown,
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.560]   possibly massive number.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.600]   Somebody had a serious medical scenario.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.200]   It wouldn't be strange to have a million dollars of expenses
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.540]   in a serious medical crisis.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.840]   But with something like a house and homeowner's insurance,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.820]   there's a specific amount of damage that could be done.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.660]   It's the value of the house.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.160]   What would it take to raise the house and start again?
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.820]   Well, that might be, that's a specific calculable number.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.180]   Maybe it's $150,000 if you live in a $150,000 house.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.620]   So when I look at property and casualty insurance,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.860]   in some ways, I'm much more comfortable with self-insuring
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.740]   because the risks have a limit.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.180]   There's a limit to the risk.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.060]   Your house could be totally destroyed,
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.800]   but that's not an unlimited risk.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.220]   And here's where you need to consider
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.940]   how valuable that property is
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.220]   as compared to your overall lifestyle.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.260]   People often approach this subject
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.460]   emotionally and irrationally.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.660]   Think about it in the context of insuring a TV.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.740]   Would you insure your TV,
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.020]   specifically against the risk
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.660]   of getting destroyed in a flood?
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.940]   I hope you wouldn't,
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.500]   because if your TV is so expensive
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.260]   that it would cause you
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.220]   to have serious problems financially,
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.880]   you're doing it wrong.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:16.740]   And I kind of apply this same philosophy
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.460]   towards your house and your car.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.900]   If the complete loss of your car
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.720]   would cause for you serious problems,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.100]   that means you're either very young
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.300]   or just working your way out of poverty,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.420]   or you're doing it wrong.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.220]   If you don't have any money,
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.900]   you shouldn't have a $40,000 car.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.740]   If you don't have any money,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.500]   you should have a $100, or a $400 car.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.820]   You should have a cheap car.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.460]   Don't have cars and boats and RVs
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.740]   and all that stuff that are worth more
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.320]   than one-tenth of your annual income.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.800]   So if you make $75,000 a year,
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.160]   the total value of all your cars
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.400]   should be 7,500 bucks total,
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.060]   until you're a millionaire.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.960]   Well, in that situation,
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.560]   if you lose a $5,000 car
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.160]   and you make $75,000 per year,
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.720]   it should be relatively easy
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.880]   for you to go out and buy another car.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.840]   You should be able to pull the money
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.520]   out of your bank account and go buy the car.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.660]   If that scenario doesn't describe
[00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.800]   your financial situation and your cars,
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.520]   I, to my opinion, I think you're doing it wrong.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.360]   You're doing it in a way
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.160]   that's not going to lead to wealth.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.120]   Don't own a bunch of expensive stuff
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.320]   that's not very valuable.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.760]   That's the point with cars.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.440]   So if your car gets flooded out,
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.100]   that's a bummer and it may be destroyed,
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.120]   but personally, I personally would generally choose
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.000]   not to worry about making sure
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.760]   that I have comprehensive insurance on my cheap cars.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.040]   And in some ways, I think the same thing
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.000]   applies to your house.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.780]   One thing that's unique about many very wealthy people
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:47.800]   is although they might live in very fancy houses,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.940]   the house has a small portion of their net worth.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.260]   Now, this is unfortunately where we get
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.640]   into very sensitive territory
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.760]   because most US Americans,
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.920]   I don't know about the rest of the world,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.320]   but most US Americans who own homes
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.020]   have an out-of-whack portfolio
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.540]   where they have far too much risk in their personal house.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.080]   It's very common that the biggest asset
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.080]   that somebody owns is their house
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.000]   and the most money that somebody has
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.600]   is tied up in home equity.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.080]   That's a big, big risk
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.480]   and I don't think that's a smart way to do it.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.680]   I think it's much smarter to diversify your risk
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.600]   and keep your house, which is a consumption item,
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.920]   keep it as a small portion of your net worth,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.220]   as small as possible.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.700]   The problem that we have is this is not always practical.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.900]   You can't always practically work this out
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.760]   just like you'd want to.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.640]   Of course, we'd all love to be able to rent cheap houses
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.600]   and buy cheap houses, but it's not always practical.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.200]   If you live in Houston, Texas,
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.080]   you may not be able to find a cheap house to live in.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.600]   And so just simply due to the lack of availability,
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.160]   the lack of supply of homes,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.880]   it's frequent that you might wind up
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.480]   with more house and more equity than you would love.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.840]   And the other problem that's compounded
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.200]   is even if your actual equity in your house isn't huge,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.120]   you're still probably on the balance for a mortgage
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.020]   and your mortgage company is going to require,
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.380]   very intelligently, a significant insurance policy.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.740]   So when you're considering these things,
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.400]   you need to carefully calculate for yourself
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.940]   the actual risks and what you can handle,
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.260]   look at your finances, et cetera.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.260]   If you don't have a lot of money,
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.580]   if you find yourself in a situation
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.940]   where you have a lot of house
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.060]   and don't have a lot of money,
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.060]   better buy a lot of insurance.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.420]   If you find yourself in a situation
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.260]   where you have a lot of money and not so much house,
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.660]   you could probably forego some of the insurance.
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.360]   The premiums are going to make a big difference for you.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.440]   I know when I looked at flood insurance,
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   when I previously owned a house,
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.200]   I looked at flood insurance, I calculated the premiums,
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.100]   I sat down and thought,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.280]   okay, if my house were flooded three feet up the walls,
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.860]   which is very unlikely in where I lived,
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.520]   didn't live in a floodplain, et cetera,
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.480]   my house were flooded three feet up the walls,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.320]   what would be the cost?
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.640]   I went around and kind of tabulated everything.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.560]   And the way you deal with this stuff after the flood
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:03.360]   is you basically get in there as quickly as you possibly can
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.960]   take everything out of the walls down to the studs.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.000]   They do that in order to help with mold mitigation.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.700]   So the disaster relief looks basically like
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.440]   you have crowds of people that come in,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.900]   cut all the drywall above the flood line,
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.140]   the high water line, cut all the drywall out,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.180]   pull the insulation out,
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.100]   take everything out down to the studs
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.820]   and throw it out to the curb.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.040]   And the idea is the quicker you can get that done, the better.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.420]   And so you run a lower risk of keeping the house
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.160]   sodden and soggy, which leads to mold problems,
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.940]   which is much more work to eradicate.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.980]   If you have mold problems,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.940]   you gotta get it down to the studs oftentimes
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.940]   in order to kill the mold and to deal with that
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.580]   so you can rebuild and then come back
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.300]   and put in fresh flooring, put in fresh insulation,
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.500]   put in fresh wall treatments, et cetera.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.180]   But I went around and I thought about it.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.580]   I thought about how much that would cost.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.740]   And of course I have, and as many of you have as well,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.620]   you have the benefit of certain physical skills.
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.260]   I can put up drywall, I can run insulation,
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.560]   I can do flooring and network.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.100]   If you have a large network of people, friends,
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.000]   fellow church members, family members who can help you,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.760]   a lot of times those are big costs.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.360]   And so I was comfortable taking on the risk of the flood
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.800]   myself, knowing that I could recover.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.120]   And when you calculate, you know,
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.160]   two or three, $4,000 per year of flood insurance premiums,
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.000]   you can start saying,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.480]   what's the risk of me facing a flood in the next decade?
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.640]   A lot of times I'd be comfortable with that risk.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:28.120]   I came to the same conclusion with windstorm,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:28.960]   with hurricanes.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.320]   I've been through hurricanes, seen roofs destroyed.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.400]   You calculate the cost of a new roof.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.960]   You look at the actual structural integrity of your house.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.440]   And a lot of times,
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.480]   as long as you don't have very little money
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.760]   and too much house,
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.860]   you may be able to take on that risk yourself.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.120]   Go up, reinforce the attic, brace everything,
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.320]   make sure your strapping is on track.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.760]   And hey, if I need to re-roof my house, I can do it.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.000]   I've roofed plenty of houses before.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.220]   Point of all this is to say that that's why I'm often
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.120]   much more skeptical of property insurance
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.720]   and excessive amounts of property insurance
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.980]   than I am liability insurance
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.160]   or insurance for risks
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.220]   that don't have a clear maximum value.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.160]   Your house has a clear maximum value,
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   and you can therefore make more of a calculated decision.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.320]   Health insurance,
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.100]   a little harder to find that clear maximum value.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:29.840]   So I'm not sure how to tell you
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.960]   what you should do in your situation,
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.920]   but look at the flooding that's happening in Houston,
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.840]   and then think about what you would face
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.320]   if you were in that situation.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.520]   I think that's enough to point you
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.760]   in the right direction today.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.560]   Your plans and your own personal approach
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.920]   will change over time.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.280]   Now, one of the things that I have learned
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.040]   in this current stage of my life
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.560]   is that there are many lives that depend on me.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.880]   I've always been,
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.080]   if I were hearing this advice a decade ago,
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.280]   get out of the problem area,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.680]   get out of the disaster area, I would have laughed.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.560]   My philosophy is always run to the disaster area
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.480]   and go and serve and to help.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.880]   And I still have that instinct and that impulse
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.280]   as I always wanna be in the thick of it.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.480]   But at this stage of my life,
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.800]   it would be irresponsible.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.680]   You have to start by caring for those close at home.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.600]   And the number of lives that depend on me
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.960]   is more significant.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.200]   This is not the stage of my life
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.520]   for me to go and wade into a disaster area.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.620]   So your plans and your ideas and your approaches
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.040]   will change over time.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.400]   And what I've shared with you today,
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.120]   none of this has been intended to be comprehensive.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.240]   The unique variables of your location
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.160]   and your circumstance will make a difference for you.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.360]   If you live at the foot of a volcano,
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.360]   your risks are different
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.240]   than if you live on the edge of the seashore.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.640]   If you live in blizzard country,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.080]   your risks are different
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.920]   than if you're in an earthquake zone.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.800]   If you live in a wildland forest fire area,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.380]   your risks are different
[00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:02.460]   than if you live in a low-lying flooding area.
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.540]   If you live downwind of a nuclear reactor,
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:08.620]   your risks are different
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:13.380]   than if you live in a city like a Washington DC
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.400]   or a New York,
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.240]   which are high probability of terrorist,
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.600]   targets for terrorism
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.080]   or for attack by a foreign nation state.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.780]   So sit down and look at your own risks
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.940]   and then think about the plans.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.040]   What you'll find is if you do,
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:32.180]   if you do that is there will be a few unique aspects
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.880]   to your own risk planning.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   You might stock a little bit more potassium iodide
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.980]   if you live downwind of a nuclear reactor
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.620]   than if you live at the base of a volcano.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.260]   But the end of the day,
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:49.000]   there's just some simple common things.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.020]   Get out of the area if you can,
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.060]   stay home if it's safer,
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.800]   be able to support yourself
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.260]   and take care of your needs
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:58.220]   for food and water and sanitation
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.960]   and health and comfort.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.180]   Make sure your important papers are squared away.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.160]   Think through these things.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.860]   I will link in the description for today's show.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:09.800]   Back when there was a hurricane
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.720]   coming through West Palm Beach,
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.860]   I did another show or two on just some simple ways,
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.300]   for example, to stay at home.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   Talked about the importance
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.780]   of being able to charge your cell phone.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.020]   I kind of skipped over that today,
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.520]   but as you see your cell phone is your number one tool
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.840]   and you should always have multiple methods
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.380]   to keep it recharged and ready to go.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.660]   It's a huge, huge issue and it's easy to solve.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.100]   Talked about ways to stay at home and have that.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.120]   So I'll post some other kind of emergency preparation shows
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.340]   I've done that are from the archive
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.580]   in the description for today's show if you'd like more.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.700]   But look at Houston and think about your situation
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.880]   and look for opportunities to help.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.400]   If you're in a place of strength,
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.700]   you're in a place of abundance,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.260]   that positions you very well
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.640]   to be able to help those who are hurting.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.480]   God bless.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.080]   This show is part of the Radical Life Media Network
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.340]   of podcasts and resources.
