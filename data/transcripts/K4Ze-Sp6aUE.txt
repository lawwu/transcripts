[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.120]   Today, my guest is Dr. Lane Norton.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Dr. Norton is one of the foremost experts
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.280]   in protein metabolism, fat loss, and nutrition.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.720]   He did his degrees in biochemistry and nutritional sciences
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.820]   and is considered one of the world experts
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.100]   in understanding how we extract energy from our food
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.440]   and how exercise and what we eat combine
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.160]   to impact things like body composition and overall health.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.500]   Today, we discuss an enormous number of topics
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.800]   under the umbrella of nutrition and fitness,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   including, for instance, what is energy balance?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.380]   That is, how do we actually extract energy from our food?
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.800]   We also discuss the somewhat controversial topic
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.600]   of artificial sweeteners, whether or not they are safe or not
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.500]   and whether or not they are an effective tool
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.840]   for weight loss, in particular for people suffering
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.720]   from obesity and different types of diabetes.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.840]   We also talk about gut health, that is the gut microbiome,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   and how it's impacted by food
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.960]   and how it can actually impact the metabolism
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.460]   of the foods that we eat.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.440]   We also discuss fasting, or so-called intermittent fasting,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   or time-restricted feeding, what it does
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.360]   and what it does not do in terms of how effective it is
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.680]   for weight loss and perhaps even for health and longevity.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.300]   We also talk about protein and define very clearly
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.560]   how much protein each and all of us need,
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.600]   depending on our daily activities and life demands.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   We discuss the various types of diets
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.520]   that you've probably heard about,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.760]   including ketogenic diets, vegan diets, vegetarian diets,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.920]   and pure carnivore diets,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.880]   as well as more typical omnivore diets,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.860]   and how to make sure that you get all
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.460]   of the essential amino acids that are critical
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.840]   for healthy weight maintenance, weight loss,
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.580]   or directed muscle gain.
[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.840]   We also talk about supplements, in particular,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440]   the supplements for which there is an immense amount
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.360]   of science pointing to their safety and efficacy
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.720]   for fitness and for overall body composition.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.120]   What I'm sure will become clear to you
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.480]   as you hear Layne talk about each
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.080]   and every one of these topics,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.200]   is that he has an incredible ability
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.600]   to both understand the mechanistic science,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.040]   but also the real-world applications
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.840]   of the various discoveries that are made
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.660]   in particular papers, and in particular,
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.380]   in the randomized controlled trials.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.160]   That is, when a given scientific hypothesis has been raised,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.220]   he's extremely good at understanding why it was raised,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.060]   but also at evaluating whether or not it works
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.040]   in the real world, which is what I believe
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.720]   most everybody out there is concerned with.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.020]   I think this is one of the things
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.400]   that really distinguishes him from the other voices
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.200]   in the nutritional landscape.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.680]   I assure you that by the end of today's discussion,
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.880]   you will have a much clearer understanding
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.000]   about what the science says about nutrition,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   about fitness, and about how different diets
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   and fitness programs combine to achieve the results
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.920]   that you want.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.520]   that this podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.860]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.760]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.680]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.620]   Element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.060]   and nothing that you don't.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.280]   That means it contains sodium, potassium, and magnesium,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   the so-called electrolytes, but no sugar.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.760]   As you may have heard me discuss before on this podcast,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.900]   every cell in our body,
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.680]   and in particular cells within our brain,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440]   the so-called neurons or nerve cells,
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.680]   critically rely on the presence of electrolytes,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.880]   in order to function properly.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.620]   I myself am a big believer in consuming electrolytes
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.060]   anytime I've been sweating a lot,
[00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.400]   so that could be after or during exercise
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.840]   or after doing the sauna.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.440]   So by drinking electrolytes
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.840]   in the form of Element electrolyte mix,
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.620]   I'm able to replenish those electrolytes
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.720]   and maintain mental clarity and energy throughout the day.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.160]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.020]   of 1,000 milligrams of sodium,
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.760]   200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.240]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.400]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.220]   you can go to drink element, spelled lmnt.com/huberman
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.200]   to get a free sample pack with your purchase.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.100]   Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.760]   to get the free sample pack.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.380]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.640]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.480]   The company was founded
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.540]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.180]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.220]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.980]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.900]   of the visual system,
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.260]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.740]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.140]   in order for you to see clearly.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.840]   For instance, when you move from a sunny area
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.660]   to a shady area and back again,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.200]   whether or not you're looking at something up close
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.480]   or off into the distance,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.840]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.600]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.880]   so that you always see with perfect clarity.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.860]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially designed
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.340]   for activities such as running and cycling,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.860]   and indeed they are very lightweight.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.240]   Most of the time I can't even remember
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.280]   that they're on my face, they're so lightweight.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.400]   But the important thing to know
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.040]   about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.680]   is that while they can be used during sports activities,
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.560]   they also have a terrific aesthetic
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.460]   and they can be used just as well for wearing to work
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.480]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.920]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.760]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.240]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.280]   to save 20% off on your first order.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.520]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.680]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.760]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.440]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition program
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.000]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.700]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.600]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   Now I've long been a believer
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.420]   in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.740]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.900]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.600]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.560]   One of the major issues
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.140]   with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.900]   is that you get information back about levels of hormones,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.840]   levels of lipids, levels of metabolic factors,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.760]   but you don't know what to do about that information.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.620]   With Inside Tracker, they have a easy to use platform
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.480]   that allows you to assess those levels
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.940]   and then determine what sorts of behavioral changes,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.680]   nutritional changes, maybe even supplementation changes
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.020]   you might want to make in order to bring those numbers
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.400]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.880]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.080]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.900]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.200]   The Huberman Lab podcast
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.040]   is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.360]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.580]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.200]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.560]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   And I should just mention
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   that the library of those supplements
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.340]   is constantly expanding.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.480]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.320]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Lane Norton.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.840]   Lane, Dr. Norton, thank you so much for being here.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.040]   This is a long time coming.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.880]   And I have to say, I'm really excited
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.340]   because I've seen you in the social media sphere.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.760]   I've also listened to a number of your other podcasts.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.600]   And as a fellow PhD scientist,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.560]   I feel a great kinship with you.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.080]   I know you have tremendous experience
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.800]   in fitness and nutrition, a number of areas.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.680]   We also got a lot of questions from our audience,
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.780]   and I'm really looking forward to talking with you today.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.680]   - Yeah, I'm excited too.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.600]   I mean, like you said,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.680]   it's been something we've been talking about
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.520]   for a long time.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.140]   So I was glad we were able to make it happen.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.120]   - Yeah, indeed.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.960]   And I think some of the audience
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.200]   has requested a debate or a battle,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.500]   and I can tell you right now, it's not going to happen.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.480]   Actually, one of the things that brought Lane and I together
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.260]   in conversation online and then via text, et cetera,
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.260]   was the fact that I love to be corrected.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.560]   And that's what happened.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.980]   I did a post about artificial sweeteners,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.980]   which we will talk about a little bit later in the episode.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.000]   And Lane pointed out some areas of the study
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.420]   that I had missed or maybe misunderstood,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.460]   and I revised my opinions and I think it's wonderful.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.040]   And other studies have come out since then.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.100]   So hopefully our conversation will serve as a message
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100]   of how science and actionable science can be perceived
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.560]   and that it doesn't always have to be a battle,
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.160]   but hey, if we get into it, we get into it.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.600]   It won't get physical because we know you would win.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.680]   So in any case,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.600]   I'd like to start with something that's rather basic
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.400]   and yet can be pretty complex.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.780]   And that's this issue of energy balance
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.460]   and energy utilization.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.400]   I think most people have heard of a calorie.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.260]   I'm assuming that most people don't actually know
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.780]   what that is in terms of how it works, what it represents.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.120]   And so maybe you could just explain for people
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.620]   what happens when we eat food of any kind
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.700]   and how is that actually converted into energy
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.560]   as a way of framing up the discussion around weight loss,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.580]   weight maintenance, weight gain, and body composition.
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.580]   - So a great question.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.540]   And like you said, this is one of those things where,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.780]   you know, people use the term calories in, calories out,
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.540]   and they say, well, that's way too simplistic.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.220]   And I'm like, if you look at what actually makes up
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.860]   calories in, calories out,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.980]   it's actually very complicated, right?
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.560]   So let's deal with what you mentioned first.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.640]   What is a calorie?
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.180]   Because I think a lot of people don't quite understand this.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.820]   So a calorie just refers to a unit of energy,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   of heat specifically.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.660]   And so, well, what does that have to do with food?
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.060]   What does that have to do with like what we digest and eat?
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.880]   Really what you're talking about
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   is the potential chemical energy
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.580]   that is in the bonds of the macronutrients of food, right?
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.700]   And by digesting, assimilating,
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.620]   and metabolizing those nutrients,
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.700]   we're able to create energy.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.500]   And the end product of that mostly is ATP,
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.860]   adenosine triphosphate,
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.700]   which is your body's energy currency.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.980]   So to understand ATP,
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.580]   just try to think about if you're trying to power
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.260]   these various reactions in your body,
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.680]   and we're talking about tens of thousands of enzymes
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.140]   that require ATP,
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.660]   it doesn't make sense that you would have to create
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.460]   a bunch of micro explosions, right?
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.980]   You want something that can transfer high energy phosphates
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.460]   to power these reactions,
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.660]   to give up essentially its energy,
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.660]   to power something that might otherwise be unfavorable.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.740]   So a lot of metabolism is simply creating ATP,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.900]   which the end of the line of that,
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.780]   I'm gonna kind of work backwards,
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.820]   is what's called oxidative respiration.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.540]   So that happens in the mitochondria.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.220]   Everybody's heard, "Monochondria powerhouse of the cell."
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.780]   And that is done through essentially
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.300]   creating a hydrogen ion gradient across the mitochondria,
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.860]   which powers the production of ATP
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.700]   by converting free phosphate plus ADP to ATP.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.900]   Now, the way that hydrogen ion gradient is created
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.340]   is through creating hydrogen ions
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.080]   that can be donated through the Krebs cycle.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.720]   Now, the Krebs cycle is linked to glycolysis.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.060]   So if we talk about carbohydrate metabolism,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.260]   carbohydrates, basically other than fructose,
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.220]   get converted into glucose, which can go into glycolysis,
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.940]   and you can produce some ATPs through glycolysis.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.700]   And then it boils down to pyruvate, then acetyl-CoA,
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.100]   which goes through the Krebs cycle,
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.380]   produces a lot more ATPs from that.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.140]   If you talk about protein,
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.340]   protein's a little bit different
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.180]   because protein gets converted to amino acids,
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.120]   which can be used for muscle protein synthesis
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.820]   or protein synthesis in other tissues,
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.140]   but it also can be converted
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.860]   through glycogenesis to glucose.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.920]   And there also are some ketogenic amino acids as well.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.580]   And so you can have a few different ways
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.940]   to get to the Krebs cycle,
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.260]   either being through acetyl-CoA
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.960]   or through glucose going through glycolysis to pyruvate.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.020]   Then you have fatty acids,
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.460]   which are able to create energy
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.400]   through what's called beta oxidation,
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.000]   where essentially you're taking these fatty acids
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.340]   and you're lopping them off two carbons at a time
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.820]   to produce acetyl-CoA,
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.180]   which again can go into the Krebs cycle,
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.360]   produce those hydrodions
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.020]   that can then power the production of ATP.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.040]   So that's kind of like at the cellular level
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.820]   of how this stuff works.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.940]   But stepping back and taking it back out,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.140]   like what does that have to do
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.820]   with weight loss or weight gain, right?
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.540]   Well, when you think about the balance
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.340]   of energy in versus energy out,
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.620]   sounds very simple,
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.380]   but let's look at what actually makes up
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.620]   energy in versus energy out.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.780]   First of all, you've got to realize
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.520]   that the energy inside of the equation
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.960]   is more difficult to track than people think, right?
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.780]   So one, food labels,
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.780]   which we like to think is being, you know,
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.780]   like from upon high,
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.700]   can have up to a 20% error in them.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.540]   - Really?
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.360]   - Oh yeah.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.260]   - So a hundred calorie,
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.220]   is something listed as a hundred calories per serving,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.500]   it could, what's actually in there,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.220]   it could be 80 or 120.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.660]   - Right, exactly.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.680]   So that's one aspect of it.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.380]   The second aspect is there's what's called your energy,
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.480]   but then there's also metabolizable energy, right?
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.220]   So if you have a food stuff with say
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.880]   a lot of insoluble fiber,
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.060]   typically insoluble fiber is not really digestible.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.920]   And so you could have, you know,
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.260]   quite a bit of carbohydrate, you know,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.960]   but if you can't extract the energy from it,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.980]   and typically this is because insoluble fiber
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.180]   from like plant material,
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.060]   the carbohydrate or, and even some of the protein,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.780]   is bound up in the plant structure,
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.900]   which makes it inaccessible to digestive enzymes.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.360]   And so this is what like adds bulk
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.140]   to your stool and whatnot.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.280]   But again, reduces the metabolizable energy in there.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.740]   And there's some evidence that based on
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.660]   people's individual gut microbiome,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.900]   that some people may actually be better at extracting energy
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.980]   out of fiber compared to other people.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.060]   So just starting off right there, okay,
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.940]   there's quite a bit of play in the energy inside of things.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.060]   Now, one of the things people will say is,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.340]   well, see, that's why you shouldn't worry
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.300]   about tracking calories.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.620]   'Cause you know, if the food labels can be 20% off
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.640]   and what I'll say is, okay, that's,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.020]   I understand where you're coming from,
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.380]   but typically if it's off,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.060]   it's gonna be consistently off.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.180]   And if you're consistent with how you track it,
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.540]   eventually you'll be able to know
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.520]   kind of what you're taking in.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.940]   And that's kind of like saying,
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.900]   well, don't worry about tracking, you know,
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.100]   if you're, I like to use financial examples.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.740]   You know, we know that to save money
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.500]   or you have to earn more money than you spend.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.440]   Well, you can't exactly know how much money
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.900]   you're earning at a time, you know,
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.140]   'cause there's inflation and then there's,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.900]   if you have investments, those can be, you know,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.360]   different interest rates and whatnot.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.660]   Say, okay, but you're, you know, if you have a budget,
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.100]   you have a reasonable idea of what it's gonna be, you know,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.780]   and you make certain assumptions,
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.600]   but you can relatively guess.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.640]   - Yeah, that's a good example.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.920]   - Right.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.060]   So now let's look at the energy outside of the equation,
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.000]   which is actually way more complicated, right?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And so your energy out is a few different buckets.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.500]   The first one and the biggest one
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.800]   is your resting metabolic rate, so your RMR.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.940]   And that for most people is anywhere from 50 to 70%
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.540]   of your total daily energy expenditure.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.780]   Now people use the term metabolic rate
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.300]   and energy expenditure kind of interchangeably,
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.140]   but they're not the same thing.
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.980]   So your total daily energy expenditure
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.740]   is the summation of all the energy you expend in a day.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.820]   - Walking upstairs, exercise if you do it.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.060]   - Fidgeting, yeah.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.780]   - Plus your resting metabolic rate.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.140]   - Right, so resting metabolic rate is a big part of that,
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   but it's not the only thing.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.460]   So that's usually about 50 to 70%.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.580]   And sedentary people will be on the higher end of that,
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.820]   so it'll be a bigger proportion,
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.300]   whereas people who are more active,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.860]   it'll be a little bit lower,
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.340]   not because their metabolic rate is lower,
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.300]   but because they're expending a greater percentage
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.380]   of their calories from physical activity.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.940]   Then you have something called the thermic effect of food,
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.980]   which is a relatively small percentage
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.740]   of your total daily energy expenditure.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.140]   It's about five to 10%.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.660]   And very difficult to measure,
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.140]   and usually what researchers do
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.140]   when they're kind of looking at this stuff
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.860]   is they just kind of make an assumption about it.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.700]   They use a constant.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.860]   But that's about five to 10%
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.980]   of your daily energy expenditure,
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.940]   and that refers to the amount of energy it takes
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.740]   to extract the energy out of food.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.420]   So think about your body kind of like a car, right?
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.820]   You don't just have gas in your tank
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.300]   and it spontaneously starts up, right?
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.220]   Like you have to have a battery,
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.380]   so you put in energy so you can get the energy
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.480]   out of the petrol that you have in your car.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.420]   Similar with food, you can't just eat food
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.740]   and then it just appears in your cells
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.480]   and you start doing stuff.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.700]   It has to be systematically broken down
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   and put into forms that can actually produce energy.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.300]   And so you have to put some energy in to achieve that.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.500]   And a lot of times people will say something like,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.860]   well, not all calories are created equal.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:24.140]   That's not true because calories
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.940]   just a unit of measurement, right?
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.700]   That would be like saying not all seconds
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.340]   on a clock are created equal.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.660]   Yes, they are.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   All sources of calories may have differential effects
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.120]   on energy expenditure and appetite.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   So if we look at something like fat, for example,
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.920]   the TEF of fat is about zero to 3%,
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.120]   meaning if you eat 100 calories from fat,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.640]   your net will be about 97 to 100.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.720]   - So the process of breaking down that fat
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.520]   essentially subtracts some of the calories away
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.200]   because you used it in creating energy
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.360]   by breaking those chemical bonds to create ATP.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.740]   - Correct. - Okay.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.940]   - So you have like, for example,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.960]   some enzymes that require ATP to run these processes.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.580]   Now fat is actually the easiest thing to convert into energy.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.540]   Then you have carbohydrate,
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.940]   which has a TEF of like five to 10%.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.020]   So you eat 100 calories from carbohydrate.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.820]   And obviously like the fiber content
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.760]   makes a big difference on this.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.940]   But if you eat 100 calories, you'll net 90 to 95.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.740]   Protein is about a 20 to 30% TEF.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.100]   So if you eat 100 calories from protein,
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.180]   you're only netting 70 to 80.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.140]   Now you're still net, you know, people say,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.300]   well, you can't eat too much protein.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.840]   Well, you know, people will ask well,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.280]   can protein be stored as fat?
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.200]   The carbons from protein,
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.040]   it's unlikely it's gonna wind up in adipose tissue.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.680]   But if you're eating a lot of protein overall
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.840]   as part of a lot of calories, it does,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.160]   it has to be oxidized and it can provide a calorie cushion
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.560]   for other things to be stored in fat.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.220]   But protein itself does provide, you know,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.520]   a net positive for calories,
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.800]   but less so than carbohydrate or fat
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.280]   and tends to be more satiating.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.440]   So again, when people talk about, you know,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.840]   are all the calories created equal?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.460]   Yes, but all sources of calories
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.540]   may have differential effects
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.060]   on energy expenditure and appetite.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.100]   So that's the TEF bucket and the BMR bucket.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.740]   Then we go to physical activity.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.900]   And physical activity is essentially two parts.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.020]   There's exercise, which is kind of your purposeful movements
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.520]   like you go out for a walk, you do a training session,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.080]   I mean, whatever, any purposeful activity.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.720]   And then you have what's called NEAT,
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.300]   which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.160]   which I think is actually really cool.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.040]   - It's fascinating.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:30.880]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.640]   So it's, I was actually hanging out with somebody last night
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.080]   and I was noticing them and they were fidgeting their feet
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.920]   and their fingers.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.140]   And I said, you know, have you always been pretty lean?
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.520]   And they were like, yeah, I never really had a problem
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.420]   maintaining leanness.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.740]   And when you look at the obese resistant phenotype,
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   people think they have high BMR or, you know,
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.380]   they exercise a lot and really what it seems to be is NEAT.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.360]   They tend to, if they overeat,
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.240]   they just spontaneously increase their physical activity.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.980]   Now, people get NEAT confused.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.840]   I've heard people say, well, I'm gonna go out for a walk
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.100]   to get my NEAT up.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.440]   That's not NEAT.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.080]   NEAT is not something you can consciously modify.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.980]   What you're doing there, if it's purposeful, it's exercise.
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.760]   So for example, when I'm talking,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.280]   if I'm waving around my hands, if I'm tapping my feet,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.080]   if I'm whatever, that's NEAT.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.840]   But, you know, trying to like get yourself,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.980]   well, I'm just gonna tap my foot more.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.160]   Well, now if I'm consciously having to do this,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.040]   then my focus, I mean, you know how the brain works.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.300]   Very hard to do.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.100]   You know, you don't really do two things at once.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.840]   You kind of switch quickly between tasks, right?
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.680]   - Absolutely.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.220]   Can I quickly ask, was the person that you're referring to
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.120]   our friend Ben Bruno?
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.140]   - No, no, but he is fidgety too.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.160]   - Amazing online fitness channel.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.320]   He's a freakishly strong individual.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.400]   - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.560]   And I can't remember whether or not Ben,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.320]   you're a fidgeter or not, but anyway,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.200]   I'll have to go check and we'll measure your fidgeting.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.280]   About non-exercise-induced thermogenesis, NEAT.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.360]   My understanding of the old papers on this,
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.720]   old being, I guess, back to the mid-90s,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.880]   is that the calorie burn from NEAT
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.280]   is actually pretty significant.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.800]   We're not talking about 100 calories
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.140]   or 200 calories per day.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.440]   We're talking about in some cases hundreds of thousands,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.080]   excuse me, hundreds to maybe even close
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.440]   to a thousand calories per day.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.680]   Could you elaborate on that?
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.820]   - Yeah, so there was actually a really classic study,
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.400]   I think from, I want to say it's from Levine in 1995,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.280]   it was a metabolic award study,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.460]   and hopefully I don't butcher the study
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.320]   because I'm trying to pull it out of my brain.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.120]   - I don't expect you to have PubMed in your head,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.400]   although I must say you have a quite extensive
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.240]   PubMed ID grab bag in there.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.360]   - I try to bring the receipts.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.960]   I try to bring the receipts.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.280]   - We will put a link to the study in the show note captions
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.240]   so people can peruse it if they like.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.500]   So I believe they had people overeating.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.800]   I think it was by like a thousand calories a day
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.640]   and I think for six weeks.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.980]   And I mean, this is the metabolic award.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.400]   So they are, this is very tightly controlled.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.180]   It's as tight as you get.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.300]   And what was interesting is of course on average,
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.180]   people gained weight and gained fat mass,
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.300]   but some people gained more than expected.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.940]   And there was one person in particular
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.640]   who only gained like just over half a kilo, right?
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.560]   They should have gained like,
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.360]   I think it was something like three to four kilos
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.680]   it was predicted.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.240]   And what they found is this individual
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.260]   just spontaneously increased their physical activity.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.880]   Like he didn't purposely do it.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.360]   It just happened.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.280]   And I mean, you know, anecdotally,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.300]   I've seen people who are again, you know, very lean,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.880]   even eat a meal, sit down and start sweating, you know,
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.240]   and be very fidgety.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.140]   There was a natural bodybuilder back in the day
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.600]   named Jim Cordova.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.280]   And this guy was just very lean all the time.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.680]   And he was exactly that phenotype.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.520]   You know, he would walk up a flight of stairs
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.060]   and all of a sudden he's sweating.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.560]   Sit down, eat a meal, he's sweating.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.480]   You know, he just--
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.440]   - He's a furnace.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.040]   - Just expending energy.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.960]   And what's very interesting about NEAT
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.120]   is that seems to be the most modifiable.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.840]   I mean, exercise is very modifiable
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.920]   'cause you can be intentional with that.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.560]   But of, you know, BMR, TEF and NEAT,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.600]   NEAT seems to be far more modifiable.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   So even a body weight reduction of 10%,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.040]   they've observed a decrease in NEAT
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.620]   of almost 500 calories a day
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.840]   for a 10% reduction in body weight.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.240]   Now, you also do get a decline in BMR when you lose weight.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.940]   One, because you're just in a smaller body now
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.900]   and so it takes less energy to locomote.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.420]   But also there's what's called metabolic adaptation,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.200]   which is a further reduction in your BMR
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.580]   than expected from the loss of body mass.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.280]   And that's on average usually around like 15%.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.680]   But it does seem to be,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.880]   there's new evidence coming out
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.700]   on the metabolic adaptation from BMR.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.200]   And it seems to be a little bit
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.020]   kind of in the transition phases.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.320]   So if you start a diet, within the first few weeks,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.260]   you will have a reduction in BMR
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.680]   that then kind of just thereafter,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.360]   any further reduction is mostly
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.880]   from the amount of body mass you lose.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.020]   And then if you, like for example,
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.800]   finish a diet and move your calories to maintenance,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.560]   within a few weeks, BMR kind of starts to come back up.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.040]   There is still a small reduction,
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.360]   but I used to be somebody who thought the BMR,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.200]   the metabolic adaptation was a big reason
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.100]   why people stopped losing weight or plateaued.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.680]   And now I think it's much more to do with meat.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   - Interesting.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   And you've said that it can't be conscious
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.560]   because of that will distract us from other activities.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.600]   I don't know if you've had a chance to look at this study
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.420]   and I'll send it to you.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.640]   Maybe it'd be fun to do a kind of an online journal club
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   about this at some point soon.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   But there's a study that came out
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.800]   at University of Houston recently, having people do,
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.760]   now this is a long period of time,
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.680]   four hours a day of basically a soleus pushup,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.760]   which is basically a heel raise,
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.720]   kind of a seated calf raise with one foot, not weighted.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.940]   And then they looked at it a bunch of things
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.520]   about glucose metabolism and glucose clearance
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.440]   and insulin levels.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.100]   And they didn't conclude that people burned
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.320]   a ton of calories, but what they concluded
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.680]   was that blood sugar regulation improved greatly.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.960]   And I think there was a lot of excitement about this
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   at some level, but based on everything you're telling me,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.680]   this fits perfectly with what's known about meat.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.080]   So this sort of fell somewhere in between with,
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.240]   in between, excuse me, sort of deliberate exercise
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.680]   and spontaneous movement.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.640]   I guess they've tried to make that spontaneous movement
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.380]   a little bit more conscious.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.220]   - Well, what I'll tell people is if you're worried
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.340]   about meat, one thing you can do,
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.860]   like these watches, for example,
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.880]   people are like, oh, well it told me
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   I burned this many calories.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.520]   They are not accurate for energy expenditure.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.340]   I mean, it is like, there was a meta-analysis in 2018,
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.340]   I wanna say, between a 28 and 93%
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.320]   overestimation of energy expenditure by these watches.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.680]   - Fitness trackers, so for those of you listening,
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.760]   we're not gonna name the brand, but fitness trackers,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.520]   so wrist-worn fitness trackers.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.300]   - And this is across the board.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.900]   So depending on the brand, it could be more or less,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.120]   but they all overestimated the amount of calories
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.320]   you burn from exercise.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.560]   So this is actually a great example where people go,
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.560]   well, calories in, calories out doesn't work for me
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.000]   'cause I ate in a calorie deficit, I didn't lose weight.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.760]   And when I talk to them, usually it's,
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.580]   they went to an online calculator, it's a few things.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.500]   They went to an online calculator, put in their information,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.680]   it spat out some calories to eat,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.460]   and they ate that and didn't lose weight.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.020]   And it's like, well, what do you think is more likely,
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.920]   that you're defying the laws of conservation of energy
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.200]   or that you might have not gotten the right number for you?
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.780]   - The measurement tool was off.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.620]   - Yep.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.340]   The next thing is a lot of people weigh very sporadically,
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.940]   and I'll tell people, like, if you're gonna make
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.880]   an intentional weight loss a goal,
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.000]   and again, this can be different for different people,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.760]   but typically I tell people, weigh in,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.160]   first thing in the morning, where I have to go
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.680]   to the bathroom, do it every day,
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.600]   and take the average of that for the week,
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.220]   and then compare that to the next week's average.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.540]   - Can I ask one quick, sorry to interrupt,
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.380]   but one quick question about that.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.560]   When you say go to the bathroom,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.280]   not to get too detailed here unnecessarily,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.800]   but are you talking about urination and emptying your bowels?
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.320]   Ideally, because you could eat a big meal the night before.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Yeah, got it.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   So wake up, use the bathroom in all forms that you're ready,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.940]   and then get on the scale, take that measurement,
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.760]   average that across the week,
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.120]   and then maybe every Monday you take that value
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.960]   and see it progress.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.200]   - And the reason I recommend doing that is
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.640]   if you're just kind of sporadically weighing in,
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.320]   as somebody who weighs themselves pretty regularly,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.400]   I mean, my weight will fluctuate five, six pounds,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.040]   and not seemingly changing much,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.480]   and that's just, those short-term changes are fluid.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.860]   So I've had it before where week to week,
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.120]   my average didn't change,
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.140]   but between the lowest weigh-in from a previous week
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:22.820]   and the highest weigh-in might've been eight pounds, right?
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.640]   So if you're somebody who just randomly is weighing in
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.260]   and you're eating at a calorie deficit,
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.800]   and you just weigh in one day where you've just,
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.240]   whatever reason, holding some more fluid,
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.680]   then you, oh, see, this isn't working.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.440]   When in reality, your average might be dropping.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.680]   So that's one of the reasons,
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.060]   and actually, believe it or not,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.280]   weight fluctuations are actually identified
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.200]   as a major reason why people get discouraged
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.260]   from weight loss.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.400]   That it kind of stops the buy-in,
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.520]   when they have a fluctuation up.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.380]   So that's one of the reasons early,
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.360]   one of the reasons early on
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.160]   that low carb diets tend to work really well
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.440]   is 'cause people lose a lot of water weight really quickly,
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.280]   and they get that buy-in, right?
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.400]   So all of this is working.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.840]   - Yeah, we can return to that in a little bit
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.440]   because I have theories as to how that,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.740]   when people eat less carbohydrate,
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.080]   they excrete more water, and they'll see,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:10.920]   for the first time,
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.440]   they'll see some definition in their abs,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.580]   and they'll go, oh my God, this diet's amazing.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.320]   And the fluid loss does hold that promise.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.720]   I think fluid loss can do some other things
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.920]   that might make people literally feel lighter,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.960]   although it can have some negative effects.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.280]   I do have one quick question,
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.660]   and I do want, we'll return to Neat in a moment,
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.060]   but when you say the caloric burn
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.920]   as a consequence of exercise,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.280]   I want to ask about the caloric burn during that exercise.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.560]   So for instance, somebody is on the treadmill,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.760]   and they'll see, okay, they burn 400 calories.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.840]   Actually, I think this is a month
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.460]   where a number of prominent podcasters
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.160]   like Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Joe Rogan, others,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.260]   they call it Sober October,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.160]   but in addition to avoiding alcohol,
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.880]   they're burning 500 calories per day during the exercise.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.040]   They're measuring it.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.120]   A lot of people do this.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   They think they take track of whether, excuse me,
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.160]   take stock of how many calories they burned.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.600]   My understanding is that
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.780]   if that particular form of exercise
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.320]   is a muscle building form of exercise,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.040]   that at some point later,
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.800]   there might be an increase in muscle.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.080]   If you did everything right, do everything right,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.680]   and then you will burn more energy
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.560]   as a consequence of adding that tissue.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.040]   That's a long process, as you know, and we will discuss,
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.080]   but I have heard about this post-exercise
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.000]   induced increase in oxidative metabolism.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.400]   I'm probably not using the right language in here.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.600]   So if I were to go out, for instance, and do some sprints,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.240]   run hard for a minute, jog for a minute, run hard for a minute
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.860]   and do that 10 times over,
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:41.460]   let's assume I burn 400 calories during that exercise bout,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.800]   but my understanding is that in the hours that follow,
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.200]   my basal metabolic rate will have increased.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.300]   Is that true?
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.520]   And is it significant enough to care about?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.720]   - So answer both those questions.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.640]   Yes, there does seem to be a small increase
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.360]   in metabolic rate, and no, it does not appear to be enough
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.320]   to actually make a difference.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.040]   So when they look at, and again, this is where
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.760]   I tell people, I think I have a good perspective on this
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.480]   because my undergraduate degree was a biochemistry degree,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.880]   so I was very into mechanisms, you know what I mean?
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.920]   It was like, oh, if we just do this and this,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.640]   we'll get this, right?
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.140]   And then I did nutrition as a graduate degree,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.080]   and then my advisor was so great
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.180]   because you could do something over here
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.280]   and he could tell you how it would affect
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.800]   vitamin D metabolism over here.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.620]   - This is Don Lehman.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.520]   - Yeah, Don Lehman.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.040]   So he would always kind of say,
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.360]   yeah, but what's the outcome gonna be, right?
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.440]   So this is actually one of the things I changed my mind on
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.480]   was I used to be very much, well, I think high-intensity
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.880]   interval training is probably better
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.320]   because you get this post-exercise energy burn,
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.000]   which they do see in some of these studies,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.660]   but in the kind of meta-analyses
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.200]   and more tightly-controlled studies
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   where they equate work between high-intensity intervals
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.240]   and moderate or low-intensity cardio, so equating work,
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.600]   they don't see differences in the loss of body fat.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.080]   And so to me, if I'm looking at,
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.040]   that's the example of a mechanism, which is,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.960]   okay, we're seeing this small increase
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.400]   in basal metabolic rate that should lead
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   to increased loss of body fat.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.200]   But again, remember, you're capturing a snapshot in time,
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.080]   right, but we don't see a difference in the loss of body fat.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.960]   So what may be happening, and again, I'm just speculating,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.640]   but a way to explain it could be you might have an increase
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.880]   and then you might actually have a decrease
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   that tends to just kind of wash it out, right?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.580]   - And I have to imagine some forms of exercise,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.700]   this would be highly individual,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.920]   but will spike appetite more than others.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.960]   So for instance, if I go out for a 45-minute jog,
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.040]   which I do a 45 to 60-minute hike or jog once a week,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.280]   I just make it a point to do that,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.520]   or ruck or something like that,
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.280]   throw on a weight vest and hike.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.080]   After that, I find I'm very thirsty, I want to hydrate,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.680]   but I'm not that hungry.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.960]   And that's true of most all cardiovascular exercise for me.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.820]   But after I weight train, about 60 to 90 minutes later,
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.160]   I want to eat the refrigerator.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.680]   And so obviously, calories in, calories out dictates
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.760]   that that will play an important role
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.240]   as to whether or not I gain or lose weight, et cetera.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.200]   So is it safe to say that the specific form of exercise
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.900]   that people choose needs to be taken
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.920]   in consideration of calories in, calories out,
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.800]   so how much is burned during the exercise,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.960]   also how much that exercise tends to stimulate appetite.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.760]   I don't know whether or not people explore this
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.220]   in the rigorous studies.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.560]   And whether or not that form of exercise
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.840]   actually increases lean muscle mass or not.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.600]   So now we've taken exercise
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.560]   and split it into a number of different dimensions,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.020]   but this is what you are so masterful at,
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.380]   is really parsing how the different components
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.160]   work individually and together.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.760]   So if you would just expand on that,
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.500]   I'd love to know what you're thinking.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.680]   - Yeah, so this is actually a really fascinating thing.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.600]   So first thing, I want to just go back to talking about,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.280]   like for example, Bert and Tom and Joe,
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.160]   we're going to do 500 calories a day on whatever.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.520]   So those apparatuses don't measure those things
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.160]   effectively either, right, just like these watches.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.040]   But the one thing I will say is if you are,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.980]   like for example, if I do two hours of resistance training,
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.720]   typically this will say I burned about 1,000 calories, right?
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.860]   - That's a lot of resistance training.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.380]   My weight workouts are like, warm up for 10 minutes
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.900]   and then one hour of work done.
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.740]   - I love to train.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.600]   - Okay, and you can recover from,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.720]   my recovery quotient is pretty low.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.540]   So I've been training for 30 plus years
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.880]   and I've found that if I do more than an hour of hard work
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.400]   in the gym, meaning resistance training,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.460]   75 minutes, maybe I'm okay, but past that,
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.640]   I have to take two, maybe even three days off
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.480]   before I can train.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   My nervous system just doesn't tolerate it well.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.440]   So I limit it to an hour.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.240]   - And part of that to remember is like,
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.280]   I've kind of built up to that
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.940]   over a long period of time, right?
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.280]   So you couldn't just throw somebody in
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.440]   and start having them do two hours a day.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.400]   It's not going to go well for them.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.920]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.840]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.280]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.640]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.560]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.240]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.460]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.040]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.120]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.120]   once or usually twice a day
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.720]   is that it gets me the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.800]   Our gut is very important.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.360]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.120]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.520]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.160]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.040]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.840]   are optimal and vital for microbiota health.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.440]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.840]   vitamins, and minerals that make sure
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.780]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met,
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.660]   and it tastes great.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.120]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.520]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.480]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.800]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.380]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.800]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.480]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.840]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.640]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   - What I will say about the calorie trackers is,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.240]   so if I'm used to, okay,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.840]   usually burn about a thousand calories according to this,
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.240]   it's not accurate.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   But if I go in tomorrow and I do 1300,
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   it may not be accurate.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.600]   I don't know what the exact number is,
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.040]   but I can be relatively confident
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.480]   that it's more than the previous session, right?
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.900]   And so in terms of comparison, it might be okay,
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.800]   like kind of within subject.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.120]   And then the other thing I was kind of circling around on
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.000]   was if you're worried about NEAT,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.540]   tracking your steps can be helpful
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.900]   because people's step counts can spontaneously decrease
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.860]   when they're on a fat loss diet.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.140]   They don't even realize it.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.860]   So, and that, again, not a complete measure of NEAT,
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.560]   but what we've had some clients do
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.100]   with our team violin coaches is they'll say,
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.080]   "Okay, you're at 8,000 steps right now.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.480]   "We're not gonna add any purposeful cardio,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.140]   "but whatever you need to do
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.880]   "to maintain that 8,000 steps, do that."
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.340]   And sometimes they have to add 15, 20, 30 minutes of cardio
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.840]   because their spontaneous activity
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.500]   that they're not even aware of goes down.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.240]   - That's a really excellent point.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.900]   I've heard the 10,000 steps per day number was,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.800]   we all heard that.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.620]   And then I learned that 10,000 was just kind of thrown out
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.840]   as an arbitrary number.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.220]   So we're like the eight hour intermittent fasting thing.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.540]   There's a story behind that.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.880]   'Cause actually I spoke to such in and it turns out
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.300]   that the graduate student in his lab
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.840]   that did that initial study, which was on mice by the way,
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.880]   was limited to being in lab for about eight hours
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.200]   by their significant other.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.660]   So the eight hour feeding window is actually the consequence
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.360]   of this person's relationship.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.060]   - That is a really great point that people don't realize
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.240]   when they, a lot of people will try to copy
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.400]   like scientific studies and I'll tell people like,
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.140]   "Listen, scientific studies are so confined.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.280]   "You need to be very careful with how broadly you apply
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.120]   "what's in there."
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.740]   Right, like they're a very big hammer
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.020]   is kind of the way I look at it.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.500]   Okay, they're not a scalpel, they're a big hammer.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.460]   And I think a lot of times in terms of coaching,
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.900]   scientific studies will tell you what not to do
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.700]   rather than what to do, right?
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.660]   But getting back to your question about like exercise,
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.980]   appetite, so first off, I'm not really aware
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.940]   if there's evidence showing like differential effects
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.860]   of different forms of exercise on appetite.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.660]   It's possible, but again, it also could be
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.900]   like a placebo effect, right?
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.300]   Because we, like for example, you and I grew up in an era
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.900]   where the muscle magazines, it was like,
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.080]   "Well, as soon as you finish your workout,
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.480]   "you're gonna have your biggest meal of the day," right?
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.300]   And you know, when I say placebo effect,
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.740]   I think people have the wrong idea
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.560]   of what the placebo effect is.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.620]   They think that's just a feeling.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.220]   Placebo effect can actually change your physiology.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.820]   People don't realize this.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.040]   There's research showing that a placebo
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.200]   or the power of suggestion is basically as powerful
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.900]   as some pharmaceuticals.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.660]   And one of the great examples I like to use
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.180]   is actually there was a study we just covered
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:18.500]   in our research review on creatine
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.500]   where they did four groups, not supplement with creatine,
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.860]   told they weren't supplemented with creatine,
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:28.060]   not supplemented, told they were supplemented,
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.880]   supplemented, told they weren't,
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.340]   supplemented, told they were.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.500]   Basically, it just matters what they told them.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.500]   - Really? - Oh, yeah.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.160]   - This is incredible.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.740]   I have to get this study so we can link to it.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.420]   A colleague of mine at Stanford, she's been on the podcast.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.340]   I'd love to introduce you to you
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.340]   'cause I think you guys, we could really riff.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.060]   First of all, she was a former D1 athlete
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:50.740]   and then runs a lab at Stanford in psychology.
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.540]   This is Leah Crum.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.120]   And she's, and grew up in this, you know,
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.740]   very athletic, obviously, and very, very smart.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.140]   And her laboratory focuses on these belief/placebo effects
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.980]   where if you tell people all the horrible things
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.020]   that stress do to you in terms of your memory
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.620]   and cognitive functioning, and then you give them
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.780]   a memory test, they perform well below baseline.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.360]   If you tell them that stress sharpens them
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.100]   in the short term and that adrenaline
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.220]   is this powerful molecule that can really tune up
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.580]   a number of memory systems, memory improves.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.100]   And it's remarkable.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.060]   And it's consistent.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.700]   And this, and they've done this for any number
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.860]   of different things, including food allergies,
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.260]   for instance, you know, incredible results.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.940]   In any case, I'm so glad you're bringing this up.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.380]   I take creatine monohydrate and I have for years,
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.860]   five grams a day, I don't look--
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:39.700]   - It's great.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.900]   - And it's great, and I believe it's great.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.340]   So is there a compound effect of believing it's great
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.500]   and it actually being great?
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.300]   - Not in this study, but so I think the thing to point out,
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.620]   people will misinterpret that as creatine doesn't work.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.860]   And that's not what that says.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.160]   What it says is your beliefs about what it does
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.840]   are probably just as powerful as what it does, right?
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.460]   So they actually did a study, and I don't have the citation,
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.140]   but it was, I think within the last 10 years,
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.300]   where they told people they were putting them
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.880]   on anabolic steroids and wouldn't you know it,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.160]   they had better gains, even though they weren't actually
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.080]   on anabolic steroids, they had better gains
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.360]   than people that they didn't tell were anabolic steroids.
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.160]   And that's like hard outcome, strength, lean body mass,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.880]   you know, those sorts of things.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.280]   So when people say, well, I wouldn't fall
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.720]   for the placebo effect, it's like, eh,
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:32.240]   you don't have to fall for it if you believe it to be true.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.960]   The power of belief is very, very powerful.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   And as a scientist, I wish sometimes I was ignorant
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.280]   so that I could subject myself
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.680]   to the placebo effect more often.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.280]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.320]   - So kind of getting back to,
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.560]   that's just a possible explanation of maybe why, you know,
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.920]   and I'm the same way, like I get done with a workout,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.220]   like a resistance training session,
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.480]   I'm like, I'm ready to eat, right?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.940]   Now, if you look at the literature overall on exercise
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.380]   and appetite, it's not always what you'd expect.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:05.440]   Consistently, it seems to show that exercise actually
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.760]   has an appetite suppressant effect.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.320]   So people don't tend to compensate, at least fully,
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.080]   for the amount of movement they do.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.100]   And there is some evidence that,
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.800]   you've probably heard people say, well,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   exercise is a really poor weight loss tool, right?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.840]   Like if you figure out how many calories
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.080]   you should be burning from it and you do that,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.440]   you end up getting less weight loss than you would predict.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.240]   - I have a family member who is perfectly happy to eat less,
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:37.780]   but doesn't loathe exercise, but dislikes exercise.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.480]   And they're of healthy weight,
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.900]   but I'm always encouraging them to exercise more.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.720]   And so this is an ongoing battle
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.640]   in our sibling relationship.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.460]   - Well, one thing I would say is that exercise,
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.700]   independent of anything that happens with your body weight,
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:52.780]   you will be healthier.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.060]   So exercise is one of the only things
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.780]   that will actually improve your biomarkers of health
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.180]   without even losing weight.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.840]   So there's like, it'll improve your insulin sensitivity,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.520]   inflammation, all that stuff.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.400]   So everybody out there looking for a hack to be healthier,
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.940]   exercise is the hack, right?
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.780]   - Yeah, crucial point.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.920]   And our mutual friend, Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.800]   I think has gone on record several times now saying that
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.320]   of all the things that one could take,
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.920]   NMN, et cetera, metformin, regardless of whether or not
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.580]   one takes those or doesn't take those,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.660]   that the positive effects on longevity
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:31.800]   by way of biomarkers from regular exercise
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.360]   is far outweighs all of those things combined.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.520]   Not that those things don't necessarily work,
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.360]   but we're not going through them in detail now,
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.700]   but that exercise is by far the best thing we can do
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.440]   for our health span and lifespan.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.320]   I 100% agree.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.760]   And when you're talking about weight loss,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.440]   people miss the point of exercise, I think.
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.780]   There's some work that came out from Hermann Ponser as well
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.400]   that basically showed like,
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.140]   well, if you do 100 calories from exercise,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.360]   you have a like 28 calorie reduction
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.680]   in your basal metabolic rate in response to that.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.080]   So it's kind of like this
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.900]   constrained energy expenditure model, right?
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.740]   But what I would say is,
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.440]   okay, well, there's still a net of 72, right?
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.400]   So it's still okay.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.320]   And the other thing is,
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.120]   I think the effects of exercise on weight loss
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.560]   are actually more due to what it does to appetite.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.220]   So if you look at people who lose weight
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.960]   and keep it off for a number of years,
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.320]   kind of outliers,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.740]   because most people don't keep it off for years,
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.600]   over 70% of them engage in regular exercise.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   Of people who do not keep weight loss,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.320]   like maintain weight loss,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.700]   less than 30% exercise regularly.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.200]   So now that's just a correlation.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.320]   That doesn't necessarily prove causation.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.800]   But there are some pretty compelling studies
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.520]   showing that exercise increases your sensitivity
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.240]   to satiety signals.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.600]   So basically you can have the same satiety signals,
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.680]   but you're more sensitive to them when you exercise.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.000]   And there's actually a really classic study
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.960]   from the 1950s in Bengali workers,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.520]   where they looked at basically
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.660]   four different quadrants of activity.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.120]   So you had sedentary, lightly active,
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.280]   moderately active, heavily active.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.040]   Basically based on their job choice.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.360]   And they didn't have an intervention.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.080]   They just wanted to track them and see
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.040]   how many calories did they actually eat.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.240]   So it was like a J-shaped curve.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.600]   So the sedentary actually ate more food
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.800]   than the lightly active or moderately active.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.560]   But from lightly active to heavily active,
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.960]   they almost perfectly compensated
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.320]   how many calories they should be eating.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.600]   So to me, that suggests when you become active,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.540]   you can actually regulate your appetite appropriately
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.920]   or much more appropriately than if you're sedentary.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.680]   - And do you think this has to do with changes in the brain,
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.840]   brain centers that respond to satiety signals
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   from the periphery and/or do you think it has to do
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.860]   with changes in blood sugar regulation?
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.700]   What I was taught,
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.280]   and I don't know if this is still considered true,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.880]   is that spikes in blood sugar will trigger a desire
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.720]   to eat more, even though it's kind of exactly the opposite
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.760]   of what you need when you have a spike in blood sugar.
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.180]   And there's this kind of, and we'll get into this
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.640]   when we talk about artificial sweeteners,
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.120]   there's this idea in mind,
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.480]   I think I adopted perhaps falsely,
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.400]   that you eat something that's sweet
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.520]   or that tastes really good
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.740]   and you are suddenly on the train of wanting to eat more.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.580]   And I could imagine how exercise,
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.960]   if it is increasing the satiety signals,
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.540]   could be working in a number of different ways.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.040]   - Yeah, I think the effect is probably mostly
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.120]   at the brain level.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.240]   You know, the effects on blood sugar
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.380]   (sighs)
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.220]   the research out there is not very compelling
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.140]   for blood sugar driving appetite.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.980]   Now, if you become hypoglycemic, yes, you'll get hungry,
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.780]   but it's a different kind of hunger than like your normal,
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.620]   like I feel kind of empty and my stomach's growling.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.620]   Like those are, they can go together,
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.900]   but usually like the hypoglycemia is like,
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.500]   I am hot, I feel like I'm gonna pass out.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.540]   Like you wanna eat something
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.780]   not because your stomach's growling,
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.600]   but because you know that you just need some fuel.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.040]   - It's like you're getting pulled under.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.400]   - Oh yeah, absolutely. - I've been there.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.980]   I've been there when I've done longer, fast,
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.400]   something I don't do anymore
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.420]   and drank a lot of black coffee.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.980]   There was probably an electrolyte effect there
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.080]   because coffee has you excrete sodium
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.620]   and other electrolytes.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.980]   And then just feeling like I needed something,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.400]   this whole thing, like I need something,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.360]   this kind of desperation.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.460]   I never wanna be back here again.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.920]   Hypoglycemia is very uncomfortable.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.000]   - That's not fun.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   - So again, then when they look at
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.520]   actual randomized control trials
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.280]   of implementing some exercise
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.260]   where they're pretty controlled environment,
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.020]   they typically see people, if anything,
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.420]   they eat less as opposed to eating more.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.920]   Now some people, again, studies report averages, right?
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.340]   And there's individual data points.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.960]   So there are some people who at least anecdotally report
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.120]   that exercise makes them more hungry.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.280]   That's completely valid.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.300]   It's now, it could be their beliefs around it,
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.600]   it could be a number of different things,
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.560]   but it's important to understand
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.620]   that there is individual variability.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:15.800]   And I think one of the things
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.980]   that I've learned to appreciate more
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.760]   is not trying to separate psychology and physiology.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.080]   We do this a lot.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.520]   And so, well, I wanna know the physiology,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.980]   I don't care about the psychology of it.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.520]   And now I'm kind of appreciating more,
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.480]   psychology is physiology.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.080]   You know, like with most things now,
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.320]   we have kind of the bio-psycho-social model.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.720]   And I'll give you an example of this.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.680]   A lot of people get really caught up with appetite.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.880]   And if we could just suppress people's appetite.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.860]   That's part of it.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.820]   But people don't just eat 'cause they're hungry.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.820]   They eat for a lot of different reasons.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.040]   Social reasons, especially.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.600]   So can you remember the last social event
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.200]   you ever went to that didn't have food?
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.800]   - No. - Right.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.000]   If you look at dinner plates from the 1800s,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.400]   what about this big?
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.940]   Now how big are dinner plates?
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.520]   - The whole buffet. - Right.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.360]   - Right, yeah.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.740]   - If you, there's situational cues, right?
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.160]   You're sitting down to watch TV.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.960]   Oh, grab some popcorn, grab some snack, whatever.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.880]   - I even see this with it.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.680]   You know how one person will pick up their phone
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.900]   and then everyone picks up their phone?
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.780]   I think there's a similar effect with food.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.560]   - Yeah, and same thing, right?
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   Like how many times have we either done it ourselves
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.200]   or have been experienced people saying,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.480]   oh, you should have some, you should have,
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.780]   or like alcohol especially, right?
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.680]   Like people will, I was hanging out with somebody last night
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.520]   and I had a beer and they just had a water.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   And I'm like, I feel no need to try and convince them
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.680]   to do that with me, you know what I mean?
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.200]   But as humans, we're kind of herd animals.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   Like we don't wanna be doing something
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.460]   out in isolation on our own.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:02.200]   Now, this is a very tenuous, I guess, belief of mine.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   But doing things alone in isolation during kind of
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:14.540]   ancestral times, that's gonna set off your alarm system.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.720]   'Cause if you don't have other people,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.840]   you can't protect yourself, right?
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.120]   So typically things were done together in groups.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.840]   And I think that's a lot of the reason
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.800]   why we tend to be just tribal in nature
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.940]   about a lot of things, right?
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.080]   So the whole point to that is on the list of reasons
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.500]   why people eat, I mean, I've gotten to the point
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.860]   where I think that hunger is actually
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.020]   not even the main reason people eat.
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.980]   Stress, lack of sleep.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.820]   - Boredom.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.840]   - Boredom, absolutely.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.020]   So unless we can do something that addresses
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:52.020]   all those things, there's a line from a review paper,
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:53.940]   this review paper came out in 2011
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.220]   by a researcher named McLean
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.340]   and it's the best review paper I've ever read.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.920]   It was called Biology's Response to Dieting,
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.440]   the Emptiness for Weight Regain.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.460]   And basically went through all the mechanisms
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.700]   of these adaptations that happen during fat loss diets
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.700]   and how biology's response is to try to drive you back
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.740]   to your previous.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.220]   And I'm gonna butcher the quote,
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.980]   but at the end of the study he said,
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   "Basically, the body's systems are comprehensive,
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.680]   "redundant, and well-focused on restoring
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.180]   "depleted energy reserves."
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:32.180]   And any attempt or any kind of strategy for weight loss
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:38.860]   that doesn't attempt to address a broad spectrum
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.380]   of these things is going to fail.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.340]   And so that's why when people say,
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.260]   "Well, just do low carb, you won't be hungry."
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.160]   I'm like, "Yeah, but people don't just eat
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:49.300]   "because they're hungry."
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   So I think really trying to get outside the box
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.660]   and think about these things,
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.100]   and especially when you read some of the literature.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.380]   I recently read a systematic review
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.720]   of successful weight loss maintainers,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.020]   which I thought was really interesting.
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.260]   So they took people who had lost a significant amount
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.700]   of body weight and kept it off for,
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.460]   I think it was three years.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.780]   And they basically asked them questions
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.740]   and tried to identify commonalities.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.080]   And there were some things that I expected
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.840]   like cognitive restraint, self-monitoring,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.920]   exercise.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.280]   And then one of the things they said
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.500]   that I found really fascinating
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.260]   was pretty ubiquitous between people.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:29.520]   They said, "I had to develop a new identity."
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.260]   So are you familiar with Ethan Suplee?
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.100]   - No.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.580]   - So Ethan is an actor.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.440]   He's been in like, "Remember the Titans"
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.460]   and "American History X."
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.120]   - I certainly saw "American History X."
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.400]   - Yeah, so he was very large.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.220]   Like he was like 550 pounds.
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.080]   And now he's like 230 and jacked.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.420]   - Wait, he was how long?
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.960]   - 550 pounds.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.800]   - Wow.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.400]   - And whenever he puts a post on his Instagram
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:01.000]   of him training, it'll say, "I killed my clone today."
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.320]   And I asked him like, "Is this what you're talking about?
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.120]   Like creating a new identity?"
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.020]   And he said, "This is exactly what I'm talking about
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.060]   because I had to kill who I was
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.900]   because there was no way I was gonna be able
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.220]   to make long-term changes
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.660]   if I just didn't become a new person."
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:20.220]   Because there's, I mean, and addicts talk about this, right?
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.280]   Like people who were alcoholics,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.860]   they had to get new friends.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.400]   They had to hang out at different places
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.020]   because their entire life had been set up
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.300]   around this lifestyle for alcohol.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.540]   And I would actually argue that eating disorders
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:39.540]   or disordered eating patterns is much harder to break
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.100]   than other forms of addiction.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.280]   And think about food addiction.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   Well, in some ways, bulimia and anorexia are still addictions.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.840]   You can't stop eating.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.000]   Like if you're an alcoholic, you can abstain from alcohol.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.900]   If you become addicted to, say, cocaine,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.540]   you can abstain from that.
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.240]   You can never abstain from food.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.440]   And so now imagine telling a gambling addict,
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.440]   "Well, you've gotta play this slot a couple times a day,
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.640]   but no more."
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.580]   Like that's really challenging.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.640]   So yeah, I just like all this stuff,
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.620]   it's so important to be comprehensive
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.520]   with how we treat these things.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.980]   - These are incredibly important points.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.820]   And to my knowledge,
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.000]   I don't think anyone has really described it
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.400]   in a cohesive way, the way that you're doing here.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.320]   So important for people to understand this
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.100]   because obviously as a neuroscientist,
[00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.320]   I think the nervous system is creating our thoughts.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.800]   Our thoughts and feelings are related to psychology.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.920]   And therefore, of course,
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.400]   our physiology and our psychology are one in the same.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.320]   It's bi-directional.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.560]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in brain-body,
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.320]   in particular gut-brain access,
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.980]   and we can talk about that.
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.420]   But I really appreciate that you're spelling out
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.140]   how there are these different variables.
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.360]   Each one can account for a number of different things.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.920]   Exercise clearly has a remarkably potent effect,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   both during the exercise in terms of caloric burn,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.240]   overall health, and biomarkers.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.060]   And then this is wonderful to learn
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.900]   that it can increase the sensitivity to satiety signals.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.220]   I think that makes, at least in my mind,
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:14.180]   places it very high on the list of things
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.020]   that people should absolutely do,
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:17.980]   but that there are other factors too.
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:22.740]   And the identity piece is fascinating.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.580]   It reminds me also,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.440]   your story reminds me also of David Goggins,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:29.860]   who is, he talks about his former, very overweight self,
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.860]   almost as if it was a different person.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.600]   And he uses language that I'm not gonna use here,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.020]   but I met David, know David a bit,
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:40.140]   and he's every bit as intense and driven
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:44.040]   as a remarkable human being as he appears to be online.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.260]   He is that guy.
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:48.940]   But it does seem like he had to more or less kill off
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.400]   of a former version of himself,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.500]   and continues to do that every day.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.740]   And I think what your point about this other fellow
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:59.220]   who does it through a similar process,
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.340]   the word today seems to really matter.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.260]   It's not like you defeat this former version of yourself,
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.800]   and then that person is buried and gone.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:09.140]   You said, "I killed my clone today."
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.380]   And that's the way that David talks about it also.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.300]   So this is a daily process.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.740]   And I think this is not just a small detail
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.100]   in tying together all these things.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:21.100]   I think that what you are describing is fundamental
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.240]   because we can pull on each one of these variables
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.700]   and talk about each one of them.
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:25.540]   But at the end of the day,
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.160]   we're a cohesive whole as an individual.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.580]   Sorry, you were about to say.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:34.100]   - That gets actually into one of my favorite topics,
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.980]   which is why do we have such a hard time
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:40.000]   with losing weight but more so keeping it off?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.200]   Because of obese people,
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   six out of every seven obese people
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.080]   will lose a significant amount of body weight in their life.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.480]   So why do we still have an obesity problem?
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.000]   They don't keep it off.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.720]   Why don't they keep it off?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.740]   When you look at the research,
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:59.040]   basically what it suggests is because people think about,
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.560]   "I'm going to do a diet and I'm gonna lose this weight,"
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:04.920]   and they do not give any thought to what happens afterwards.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.380]   It's like, think about if you have
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.320]   some kind of chronic disease or a diabetic.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.820]   You can't just take insulin once and that's it.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.720]   You gotta take it continuously.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.840]   Otherwise, you're gonna have problems.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:24.560]   If you do a diet and you lose 30 pounds, fantastic.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:31.220]   But if you then just go back to all your old habits,
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.900]   you're gonna go back to where you were, if not more,
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.980]   you can't create a new version of yourself
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.080]   while dragging your old habits and behaviors behind you.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:42.320]   So what I'll tell people is,
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.260]   'cause people say, "Well, I'm doing a carnivore diet,"
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.320]   or, "I'm doing this diet or that diet,"
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.400]   and I'll say, "That's fine.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.080]   "Do you see yourself doing that for the rest of your life?"
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.320]   And if the answer is yes,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.800]   if you really believe that that's gonna be sustainable
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.540]   for you, and plenty of people,
[00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.600]   low carb, intermittent fasting, whatever,
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.480]   they say, "It felt easy.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.420]   "I could do this forever."
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.260]   Great.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.320]   If you're going to lose weight,
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.440]   you have to invoke some form of restriction,
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.160]   whether it is a nutrient restriction,
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.620]   like low carb, low fat, a time restriction,
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.480]   intermittent fasting, any form of time-restricted eating,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.200]   or calorie restriction, tracking macros, whatever.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.700]   So you get to pick the form of restriction.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.660]   So pick the form of restriction
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:29.160]   that feels the least restrictive to you
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.500]   as an individual, and also do not assume
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.480]   that it will feel the same for everybody else,
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.320]   because I made this mistake,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.480]   where it's like, I track things.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.880]   And so I allow myself to eat a variety of foods.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.200]   I allow myself to eat some fun foods.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.320]   But I track everything,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.960]   and I'm able to modify my body composition
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.440]   and be in good health doing that.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.820]   Now, it doesn't feel hard for me.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.680]   Part of it's I've just been doing it for so long.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.640]   But to other people, that's very stressful.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.480]   They don't want to, they say,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:59.600]   I'd rather just not eat for 16 hours.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.000]   If that feels easy for them, do that,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.320]   because the one thing that,
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.280]   there was a couple of meta-analysis on popular diets,
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.320]   and basically what they showed
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.480]   was they were all equally terrible
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.000]   for long-term weight loss.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.440]   But when they stratified them by adherence,
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.080]   and none of them were better for adherence overall,
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.360]   but when they stratified people
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.320]   just according from lowest adherence to best adherence,
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.740]   it was a linear effect on weight loss.
[00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:28.320]   So really what it says is,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.160]   what is the diet that's gonna be easiest
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.820]   for you to adhere to in the long-term,
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.120]   and you should probably do that.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.180]   And people, again, this is where I step back
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.280]   and take the 10,000-foot view,
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.180]   somebody will say, well, I'm gonna do ketogenic
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.160]   because I want to increase my fat oxidation
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.000]   and I want to do this,
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.320]   and they're talking about all these mechanisms
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.960]   and everything, and that's great.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.400]   Can you do it for the rest of your life, right?
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.680]   Is this gonna be something sustainable for you?
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.620]   And if the answer is no,
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:57.820]   you probably need to rethink
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.740]   what your approach is gonna be.
[00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:03.040]   - It's incredibly important message.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.080]   Basically that.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.060]   If I could highlight,
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.180]   if there was a version of highlight or boldface
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.800]   and underline in the podcast space,
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.980]   I would highlight boldface and underline what you just said.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.500]   And for those of you that heard it,
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.260]   listen to it twice and then go forward
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.900]   because it's absolutely key.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.660]   I think it also explains a lot of the so-called controversy
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.620]   that exists out there.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.460]   I think it also crosses over with the placebo effect.
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.200]   I almost want to say pick the nutrition plan
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.800]   that you think you can stick to for a long period of time,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.340]   ideally forever, and pick your placebo too,
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.140]   because there is a lot of placebo woven into each
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.780]   and every one of these things, intermittent fasting,
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:49.300]   keto, probably even vegan versus omnivore versus carnivore.
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.100]   - Well, they even talk about the diet honeymoon period,
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.420]   where you go into a diet
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.740]   and you're all fired up about it.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.860]   Like you're very adherent.
[01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.400]   And then what happens with every single diet,
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.180]   without exception in research studies,
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.700]   is once you get past a few months,
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.100]   adherence just starts waning and going off.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.340]   - Here we are really talking about a form of relationship.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.020]   I'm not saying that to be tongue in cheek.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.260]   Actually, we had a guest early on in the podcast,
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.560]   Dr. Carl Deisseroth, he's a psychiatrist
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.280]   and bio engineer at Stanford,
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.860]   tremendously successful Lasker award winner, et cetera.
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.780]   And he talked about love as a sort of an interesting aspect
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.780]   of our psychology where it's a story
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.460]   that you co-create with somebody,
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.020]   but that you live into the future of that story.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.960]   You know, when you pair up with somebody
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.000]   that we just referring to romantic love,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.100]   that there's this sort of mutual agreement
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:42.240]   to create this idea that you're going to live into.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.860]   So it's not just about how you feel in the moment,
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.800]   it's also that you project into the future quite a lot.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.280]   I'm seeing a lot of parallels with a highly functional
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.120]   and effective diet and I love it.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.700]   I'm not setting this parallel up artificially.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.460]   I'm setting up because I think that ultimately
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.440]   it was down to what you said earlier,
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.320]   which is that the brain and our decisions
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.660]   about what we are going to stick to
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.280]   are tremendously powerful.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.420]   - And I think one thing I will say is like, keep in mind,
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.780]   when you look at the research data,
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:14.660]   the meta-analyses on say time restricted eating versus non,
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.120]   when calories are equated,
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.160]   doesn't seem to be a difference in weight loss,
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.780]   fat loss, and most biomarkers of health.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.120]   Same thing for low carb versus low fat,
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.680]   if you equate calories and protein.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.360]   There was a meta-analysis done by Kevin Hall back in 2017,
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.960]   where they looked at the, and again,
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.200]   actual loss of body fat.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.560]   And another important point was,
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.920]   I think there was 22 studies in this,
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.280]   but all of them provided food to the participants, right?
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.840]   That's important because that ensures
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.640]   that adherence can be much higher in those studies.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.600]   Whereas like various free living studies,
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.360]   sometimes you can see funky results.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.400]   People are sneaking food or they're just not really
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.960]   eating the way that the study would ideally have to be.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.040]   - Unless the person is getting like continuous support,
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.660]   like studies where they have a dietician
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.560]   talk to people like every week,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.380]   tend to actually have pretty good adherence.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.440]   But I mean, that's expensive to have done the study.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.440]   And again, like what limits studies?
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.420]   Money, money, and money, right?
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:14.720]   But the low carb versus low fat,
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.080]   when protein and calories are equated,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.760]   basically no difference in fat loss.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.220]   Now, some people get upset about this,
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.380]   but it's like, well, to me, that's like, this is great
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.320]   because you get to pick the tool you want.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.820]   That one tool, it doesn't seem to be
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:26.840]   that much better than another.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.960]   So pick the one that works for you, right?
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.240]   Whatever lever you've got to pull,
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.040]   you've got a bunch of different options.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.440]   - You mentioned picking something you can stick to
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.700]   for a period of time.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.140]   Is there ever a case for someone saying,
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:43.560]   look, I like to eat low carb or even keto for six months
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.200]   and then switch to a more standard omnivore,
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.040]   caloric maintenance type diet, and then switch back?
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.920]   Is there any downside to doing that for sake of health
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.640]   or weight loss over time or weight maintenance over time?
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.840]   'Cause I realize not everyone is trying to lose weight.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.000]   And I definitely want to talk about at some point
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.840]   how to eat to maintain weight.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.200]   'Cause I think there are a significant fraction
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.840]   of people out there who are trying to do that.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.000]   Yeah, is there anything,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   is there any downside to being a dabbler, you know,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.040]   keto for a few months
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:14.440]   and then omnivore for a few months, et cetera?
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.080]   - I think that's actually a great thing,
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.280]   especially to like maybe find what you feel
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.900]   is easiest for you, right?
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:24.320]   But in terms of like as a strategy, I mean, I guess,
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.480]   you know, some people, this might get into dopamine,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.880]   but like, oh, change and get something new.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.720]   And like, you know, you feel a bit more positive about it.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.640]   - The new partner model.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.680]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.640]   So I don't think it's how I would usually set things up
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.720]   initially for somebody, but if somebody said,
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.640]   hey, I'd just like to have some variety and change it up,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.760]   as long as they're still like, you know, their behaviors
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.400]   and they're doing portion control or whatever it is,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.480]   and they're able to sustain a calorie deficit
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.560]   or, you know, depending on whatever their goal is,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.660]   I don't think there's really any downside to it.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.360]   I do think the one thing to keep in mind is
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.400]   when you look at like going between extremes,
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.160]   so like low fat to low carb or vice versa,
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.520]   there can be in that transition period
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.240]   a little bit of weirdness for lack of a better term.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.060]   Like for example, if you've been on a ketogenic diet
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:18.000]   and all of a sudden you move to like a higher carb diet,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.800]   you'll be like basically insulin resistant
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.680]   for just a short period of time.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.640]   Now, is that gonna cause any health problems?
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.560]   Probably not in the longterm,
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.040]   especially if you're still controlling calories.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.880]   But just because your body has kind of like
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.320]   up-regulated these systems,
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.600]   dealing mostly with fat and glucose production
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.360]   rather than glucose metabolism.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.040]   So now if you start taking glucose or carbohydrate back in,
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.200]   like for example, you get somebody,
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.520]   or a glucose tolerance test after they've been on keto,
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.600]   they'll do pretty terribly at it.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.820]   But that doesn't last that long.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.200]   - About how long?
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.040]   - Few weeks.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.880]   - I think that's important for people to know
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.040]   because I have a feeling during those first few weeks
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.720]   or the period of time when a lot of people go running back
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.240]   to what they were doing previously,
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.020]   which is not to say that they shouldn't,
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:05.600]   but I've certainly done that.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.180]   I've tried very low carbohydrate diet
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.400]   and I would have assumed,
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.280]   and now I know I'm completely wrong,
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.000]   but I assumed that I was so carbohydrate starved
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.020]   for so long that my insulin sensitivity,
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.840]   which is a good thing by the way, folks,
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.480]   would have gone through the roof
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.160]   and I would be able to just sponge up every bit of glucose
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.000]   that I would have ingested through carbohydrate.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.640]   So I did indeed switch over
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.980]   and I felt like I had pretty terrible brain fog.
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.320]   I even got some jitters and I thought,
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.460]   wait, what is this?
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.920]   My blood sugar was low before,
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.000]   now my blood sugar should be in more moderate territory.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.740]   But based on what you just said,
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.520]   I had upregulated the enzymes and systems in the body
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.980]   for fat metabolism on the keto diet.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.220]   And then switching over,
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.800]   there was basically a ramping up
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.140]   of the molecules involved in presumably in glycolysis.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:53.980]   - Transition period.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.820]   I mean, think about like,
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:55.840]   if you haven't weight trained before
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.680]   and you start weight training,
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.920]   you're going to feel pretty terrible, right?
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.460]   Like you're going to be sore and stiff
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.720]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.220]   But I will say you aren't necessarily wrong
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.140]   in what you said about being more insulin sensitive
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.120]   because it depends on how you measure insulin sensitivity.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   So if you measure with something like fasting blood glucose
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.240]   or fasting insulin or even HOMA-IR,
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.840]   those tend to be pretty good on low carb.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.760]   But then if you do an oral glucose tolerance test,
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.080]   it tends to be pretty bad.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.120]   And so it depends on your specific measure, right?
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.280]   So I think that the idea that keto makes you
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.320]   glucose intolerant or insulin resistant,
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.160]   I think, again, it's just a transition period
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.440]   and I'm not too worried about it.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.320]   But there is something important to keep in mind.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.160]   And one of the reasons,
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.340]   like if somebody was to transition out of keto,
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.420]   typically if like I'm working with them
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.200]   or one of our coaches are working with them,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.080]   we'll kind of instruct them to do it like slowly
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.120]   and kind of systematically
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.280]   over like a four to eight week period.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.720]   That way, hopefully, they're not having that period
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.600]   of two weeks where they're like,
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.760]   "Oh man, why do I feel so terrible?"
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760]   - Very important point.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.320]   I want to go to the other end,
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.720]   literally and figuratively,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.920]   and talk about gut health.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.040]   Because up until now, and certainly--
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.360]   - I see what you did with that pun.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.820]   - And certainly in the last few minutes,
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:19.320]   we've been talking a lot about sort of top-down processes,
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.820]   you know, the brain, the psychology, placebo effects,
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.040]   but the very real aspects of those,
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.620]   not that I can imagine 2,000 calories is 1,000 calories
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.500]   and somehow change the law of thermodynamics.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.340]   Can't do that.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.460]   But we've been sort of top-down
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.840]   in integrating a lot of different ideas
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.160]   into weight loss maintenance and weight gain.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.600]   But gut health,
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.020]   at least the more popular studies on gut health,
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.240]   have blown a lot of things out of the water.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.080]   For instance, this idea that you could take obese mice
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.240]   and literally give them fecal transplants from lean mice.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.760]   And yes, that sounds like what it sounds like.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.200]   Fecal transplants definitely inserted
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.160]   through the same end in which it comes out.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.360]   And I point that out because a lot of people
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.820]   would ask me that, you know, it was kind of scary to me.
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:07.720]   I thought, yes, this is not about ingesting feces.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.080]   This is, they literally do a transplant
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.520]   of feces from lean mice into obese mice,
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.800]   and the obese mice get lean.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.440]   And yes, this has been done in humans,
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.480]   limited number of studies,
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.880]   and observed some pretty impressive effects on weight loss
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.180]   that I have to assume could be related to placebo effect.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.680]   They might've told these obese people,
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.700]   hey, look, you're gonna get lean
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.760]   through this fecal transplant from lean people.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.080]   But more likely, it had some effect
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.360]   on their core physiology.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.560]   I don't know which aspects,
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.960]   although I can speculate which ones.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:42.800]   And they became leaner, they lost weight.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.640]   And that is, in some sense, miraculous,
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.360]   especially given the important role of psychology
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.000]   and exercise and satiety signals,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.160]   because I'm going to assume that they controlled
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.760]   for a number of those other variables,
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.440]   although no study is perfect.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.500]   What are your thoughts about gut health
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   as it relates to metabolism, energy utilization, and balance?
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.840]   - Yeah, so the first thing I'll say
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.000]   is I'm not a gut health expert,
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.520]   but I feel relatively comfortable talking about it
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.040]   based on conversations I've had with people who are experts,
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.440]   one being Suzanne Devkota,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.660]   who's, are you familiar with her?
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.660]   - Well, she's sort of a phenom in this area,
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.500]   from what I understand.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.940]   - So she was actually doing her master's
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:23.680]   when I was doing my PhD in layman's lab.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:24.920]   So she was one of my lab mates.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.440]   - Terrific.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.000]   - And, you know, the other thing to say is
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.160]   even gut health experts, and Suzanne will tell you this,
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.420]   they're like, you know, talk to me in 20 years.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:39.120]   We just know so little.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.760]   I think that's an overall thing
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.880]   that people don't understand,
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.720]   is the scientific consensus moves very, very slow.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.240]   And probably for good reason,
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.440]   because if we just flipped our scientific consensus
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.140]   based on one study, I mean, it would be a mess, right?
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.800]   So it's gonna take time before you really understand
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.800]   the implications of the gut and what it means.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:09.160]   So when it comes to weight loss,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.000]   there probably is a role in there.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.800]   I mean, we've seen that there's something going on.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   Now, whether that's, is it something where
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.240]   a gut microbiome makeup that's more obese resistant,
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.600]   perhaps it extracts less calories
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.480]   out of the food you eat, right?
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.560]   Or perhaps it's elevating BMR.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.160]   Although I think that that's probably somewhat unlikely.
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.760]   - Do you think it could impact
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.280]   the way satiety signals are, I mean,
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.200]   back to the brain again is the question.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.800]   We know that there's a link in the gut brain axis.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.040]   And so my suspicion is that it probably is
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.440]   working via appetite regulation.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.600]   So that, I mean, if we look at the most effective
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.020]   obesity treatments out there, which is like semaglutide,
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.560]   I mean, you consistently see a 15%,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.640]   on average loss of body weight, which is massive,
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.200]   and people keep it off, that is a GLP-1 memetic,
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.880]   which is a gut hormone.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.080]   And it basically just is a very,
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.360]   very powerful appetite suppressant.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.000]   - Not, well, I guess I'm interrupting,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.960]   but hopefully with a purpose.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.640]   There's this really interesting study
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.160]   and it's in mice admittedly,
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.520]   but published in a neuroscience journal recently.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.920]   And the basically the takeaway is that
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.720]   like so many things in neuroscience,
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.920]   the GLP-1 works in two parallel pathways.
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.900]   In the brain, it seems to impact neurons
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.480]   in the hypothalamus that control satiety.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.220]   So exactly what you're saying.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:42.440]   And in the gut, it seems to create an activation
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.300]   of the mechanosensors in the gut.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:48.580]   So the perception is that the gut is full or fuller,
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:49.620]   I should say, not full,
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.380]   because I think people who take semaglutide
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.080]   don't feel bloated.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.100]   I don't know, they might,
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.020]   but that one feels as if their gut is actually fuller
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.240]   because these mechanosensors that stretch
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.420]   are sending signals to the brain.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.680]   Oh, I actually have some food.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.160]   I'm not empty down there.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.420]   Anyway, I'm tickled by this result,
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.000]   mostly because every time I hear about a drug
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.720]   or a molecule having effect,
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.800]   we think it has an effect at one location,
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.400]   but it's kind of interesting that,
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.480]   especially for something like appetite regulation,
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.480]   that it would be impacting body and brain in parallel.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.320]   Anyway, forgive me.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.480]   - That's okay. - You can tell I'm,
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.500]   I'm really excited about this.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.640]   And here you are telling a neuroscientist, me,
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.880]   that a lot perhaps circles back
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   to these brain mechanisms of satiety.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that,
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.020]   and especially looking at the research on leptin,
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.880]   you know, like we used to think, okay,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.580]   metabolism is mostly like liver-based,
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.580]   and then, you know, there's, you know,
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.420]   metabolism in the adipocyte and skeletal muscle,
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.500]   but none of this stuff exists in isolation.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.860]   There's so much crosstalk between these pathways.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.140]   And that's, you know, when we get into mechanisms,
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.340]   the one of the things, I love mechanisms,
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.320]   but one of the things I tell people is keep in mind
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.520]   that when you're dealing with an outcome, right,
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.840]   so like when I say outcome-based,
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.360]   we're talking about physical outcomes,
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.860]   like weight loss, fat loss,
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.920]   changes in blood markers, whatever,
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:22.640]   that is the summation of thousands of different mechanisms.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.140]   So sure, sometimes you can affect a mechanistic pathway
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.660]   and you get kind of straight down the line outcome,
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.140]   but not always.
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:35.020]   You know, whenever you make a treatment or, you know,
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:36.900]   kind of anything into the system,
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.540]   it's like throwing a pebble in a lake, right,
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.080]   it creates ripples.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.100]   And we don't always know what those are gonna be, right?
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.860]   And that's why, I mean, we've seen, you know, certain drugs,
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.700]   well, it works on this pathway,
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.140]   and then they list off all the side effects,
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.020]   and you go, well, how would it create
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:53.900]   that many side effects?
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:57.100]   It's because nothing, for the most part,
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   they don't just work in one place.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.840]   There's a multitude of places it works.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.220]   And to your point about semi-glutide
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:08.580]   and the effects on mechanosensors,
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.240]   it's probably why a lot of people report
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.340]   actually kind of like low-grade nausea
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.580]   when they're using semi-glutide, because of that.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.220]   Because if you're, you know, that feeling
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.120]   is usually not like a real comfortable feeling,
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:23.600]   but I mean, it will get you to not eat.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.940]   So I think there's absolutely likely a connection
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.540]   but we haven't fully elucidated how that works.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:34.460]   And when you think about how complicated the gut is,
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.940]   I think I heard something like there's more, you know,
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.820]   there's more cells in our microbiome by far
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.100]   than there are in our body.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.900]   So we're actually more, in terms of a cell-per-cell level,
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.980]   we're actually more bacteria than we are eukaryote, right?
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:49.460]   - There's Justin Sonnenberg,
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:51.180]   who's one of the world experts on microbiome.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.460]   He's in the lab upstairs from mine at Stanford.
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.820]   And he has this idea, it's just an idea,
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.960]   that because we are indeed more bacteria than we are cells,
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.940]   the question is who's the host and who's the passenger?
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:04.820]   You know, like maybe we are just,
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.240]   maybe they're exploiting us to take them around
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.400]   and interact because they interact and grow on one another.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.220]   And so this idea, this freaks people out.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.300]   Lex Friedman will love this,
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.840]   that maybe human beings are just actually the vehicles
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.780]   for the microbiome and not the other way around.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.440]   Anyway, kind of a scary thought.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.020]   Do you do anything specifically
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.020]   to support your gut microbiome?
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.940]   Are you a probiotic guy or a fermented foods guy
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.180]   or a fiber guy?
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:33.460]   - So again, I'm gonna kind of go straight down the line
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.440]   from what I've heard from Suzanne and other experts.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:37.780]   So if you want to improve gut health,
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:40.620]   one of the biggest levers,
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.060]   the three biggest levers you can pull
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:46.220]   is not eating too many calories, exercising.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.080]   There is a connection between exercise in the gut and fiber.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.080]   So we, it is, of the things we know,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.780]   dietary fiber seems to positively impact the gut
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.900]   because it is a, what's called a prebiotic.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.680]   So your gut microbiota can take, especially soluble fiber,
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.520]   although there's actually some evidence,
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.900]   at least in mice that they,
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.180]   it might be able to use some insoluble fiber as well.
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.740]   I think Suzanne was doing a study looking at hemicellulose
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.100]   and actually seeing that some like specific forms
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.840]   of microbiota flourish with hemicellulose,
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.500]   suggesting that they may actually be getting
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.660]   some kind of fuel out of it, which is really interesting.
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.740]   But again, in mice, so you know, just huge caveat.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.940]   So your gut microbiome can produce
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.640]   these short chain fatty acids from,
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.700]   by fermenting this soluble fiber.
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.880]   And there's quite a bit of evidence
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.120]   that these volatile fatty acids,
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:48.280]   which can be then actually reabsorbed into the liver,
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.460]   that they have some positive effects.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:51.660]   Like for example, butyrate,
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.100]   when they've done butyrate supplementation,
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.660]   they've actually seen positive effects
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.220]   on insulin sensitivity.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.220]   So what we seem to understand is that
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:04.720]   more diversity seems to be better,
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.960]   fiber seems to be positive,
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.820]   prebiotics seem to work much better than probiotics.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.060]   - Supplemented prebiotics.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.820]   - Yes, so the problem with most of the probiotics
[01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:20.140]   is they're typically not concentrated enough
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:21.620]   to actually colonize.
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.100]   And even if you do colonize,
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.460]   what happens is like, let's say you colonize
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.020]   some microbiota that you didn't really have much of.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.440]   If you're not fueling it with the appropriate fiber,
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.020]   it's not gonna stay anyway,
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.260]   because it's essentially gonna starve.
[01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.460]   So the research seems to really clearly suggest
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:45.100]   that eating enough fiber, which is again, a prebiotic,
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:49.940]   that that is a better way to get a healthier gut per se
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:51.060]   than probiotic.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.060]   - What fiber sources do you use?
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.420]   And I think I realized there's a huge array
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.260]   of choices out there,
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.260]   but people will want to have some ideas
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.580]   as to how they could perhaps mimic what you're doing.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.540]   - Yeah, and I would just say diversity, right?
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.760]   So there's various evidence
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.300]   from various different fiber sources,
[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:14.340]   fruits and vegetables, obviously, grains,
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.380]   some whole grains, some cereals,
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.140]   and then various other sources.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.500]   So this is one of the things where we don't really
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.940]   have a good idea if this one source of fiber
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.980]   is better than another source of fiber.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   We just know that fiber overall is pretty good.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.220]   And one thing I'll tell people is like,
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.940]   if you want a longevity hack,
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.900]   I mean, fiber is kind of the longevity hack.
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:36.420]   If you look at some of these cohort studies,
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.500]   there was actually a recent really large meta-analysis
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.620]   of over a million subjects.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:45.500]   And basically what it showed was
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:48.820]   that for every 10 gram increase in fiber,
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:52.660]   there was a 10% reduction in the risk of mortality.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.820]   And that extended specifically also
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:57.940]   to cardiovascular disease and cancer.
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.420]   So one of the things I'll tell people
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.300]   when they get like really into,
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.540]   whether it's intermittent fasting
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:03.640]   or a lot of these other things,
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.620]   they say, that's great, that's great.
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.840]   Are you eating like over 50, 60 grams of fiber a day?
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.180]   - And I just conceptualize 50 to 60 grams.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.820]   So if I were to eat like a bowl,
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:17.580]   like a, let's just say a quarter plate of broccoli,
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.300]   and the broccoli isn't stacked to the ceiling.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:22.660]   The broccoli is just reasonably stacked on there.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.460]   Approximately how many grams of fiber is that?
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.900]   If it's like two cups of broccoli, which is a lot.
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:29.780]   - Yeah, so if you like 200 grams of broccoli per se,
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:32.020]   it would probably be like five, six grams of fiber.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.860]   - And I need to get how much per day?
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.740]   - Well, I would say typically what the recommended dose is,
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:40.580]   is 15 grams per thousand calories intake.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.180]   Because if you're eating low calories,
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.780]   it's difficult to get enough fiber in.
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.620]   But based on, and again, these are cohort studies,
[01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.580]   but you can't do 20 year long randomized
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.380]   human control trials, unfortunately.
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:57.460]   There doesn't really appear to be a top end,
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.100]   at least for the benefits of fiber.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.600]   It probably boils down to like how much you can tolerate
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.140]   without feeling uncomfortable, right?
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:05.920]   Because if you're eating like a ton of fiber,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.780]   I mean, at some point, it's not gonna be very comfortable.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:12.100]   - Exercise becomes uncomfortable or hazardous, yeah.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.460]   - And actually I'm kind of touching on that
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.780]   because I think it is important.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:20.060]   You know, a lot of people have kind of,
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.340]   in the carnivore community said,
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:24.460]   well, you don't need fiber, you poop just fine without it.
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:27.280]   And I'll always say, well, pooping is the last reason
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.120]   to have fiber.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.980]   Like, yes, it does help.
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:32.580]   It does seem to make elimination easier.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.780]   You can do it more frequently, adds bulk to stool.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.300]   But that's not why you should eat fiber.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:38.580]   Why you should eat fiber
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:41.020]   is because of the effects of mortality.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.860]   And you know, some of the pushback will be,
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:45.200]   well, this is healthy user bias.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.260]   And what I'll say is-
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.540]   - Meaning healthy people do this
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:48.380]   and therefore it's working.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.640]   - Healthy people eat more fiber and therefore.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.700]   And I mean, yeah, there's something to that.
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.820]   But if it was just healthy user bias,
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.300]   typically you would see some disagreement
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:57.260]   between the studies.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.500]   And a great example of that is like red meat.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.960]   So not every study shows red meat
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.820]   has an association with cancer and mortality.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.300]   There's differences depending on the population used,
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.240]   depending on like what they define as high red meat,
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.620]   low red meat, whether it's processed, unprocessed.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:15.760]   But I have not found a study on fiber
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.640]   and cardiovascular disease and cancer and mortality
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.560]   where it did not show improvements from higher fiber.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.160]   So to me, that suggests that that effect is real.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.160]   And so again, you know,
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.200]   as much fiber as you can get in comfortably,
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.840]   I would try to do it
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.640]   because it seems to have some really powerful effects
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.260]   and is good for the gut microbiome.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:41.880]   The other thing that may be a consideration
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.520]   for the microbiome is there's some evidence
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.240]   that saturated fat may not be great for the microbiome,
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:50.980]   that it reduces the prevalence
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.280]   of some of the more positive strains of bacteria.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.500]   And that appears to be not so much
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.680]   from the saturated fat itself,
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.640]   but from the bile end products
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.920]   that combined with saturated fat
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.280]   seems to have a negative effect
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.240]   on some of these more healthier forms of gut microbiota.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.040]   But again, this is really difficult
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.680]   because we don't even know necessarily yet
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.340]   which species of gut microbiota are positive or negative.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:21.200]   And that's, I mean, this gets into some of these studies
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.640]   where they may call it dysbiosis.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.040]   Sounds scary, but dysbiosis just means that the gut changed.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:28.880]   It doesn't necessarily,
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.240]   I mean, it doesn't tell you anything qualitative
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.480]   about whether the change was bad or good.
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.720]   And so these are just things I think we need to keep in mind
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.600]   when we talk about this stuff,
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.480]   that this stuff is still very much in its infancy.
[01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.760]   But in terms of the big levers,
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.080]   I mean, it's pretty much fits
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.960]   with what we know about a healthy lifestyle.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.680]   Exercise, don't eat too much,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.960]   consume a good amount of fiber from diverse sources.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.160]   - Fantastic.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.840]   Fantastic because it fits with what I like to think of
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.960]   as kind of the center of mass of evidence, right?
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.600]   And I'm starting to get some window
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.820]   into what your process is around selection of studies
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.640]   and no one study being holy.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.600]   But when you look at, as you mentioned,
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.020]   all the studies on fiber having a positive effect
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.280]   to some degree or another,
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.160]   it's pretty hard to refute
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.340]   that there isn't something really interesting there.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.920]   - And one thing I'll tell people is like,
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.320]   you know, one study,
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.780]   I mean, sometimes I'll change my opinion
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.640]   based on a single study
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.440]   when it's really well done and very powerful.
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.640]   But usually like one study
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.520]   is just going to move me just a little bit, right?
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.720]   Then maybe if another one comes out,
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:31.920]   move me a little bit more, right?
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.560]   And then like very slowly, I'm going to get some,
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.600]   I mean, my experience with LDL cholesterol,
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.800]   this is something I changed my mind on a while back
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.720]   when I was younger, like circa 2005,
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.280]   getting into grad school,
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.760]   kind of the prevailing thought was,
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.680]   well, it's not so much the LDL,
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.760]   it's the ratio of LDL to HDL, that's what matters.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.480]   And probably about five years ago,
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.920]   and I was pretty strong about that opinion.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.040]   And then five years ago,
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.980]   looking at these Mendelian randomization studies,
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.220]   I kind of went, I can't hold this position anymore.
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:06.660]   - What's your new, what is your revised position on LDL?
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:09.140]   - So if you look at the research,
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.940]   HDL is important because it's a marker of metabolic health.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.080]   If you have high HDL,
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.600]   it suggests that you are metabolically quite healthy.
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.760]   You very rarely will you have high HDL
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:21.420]   and like high CRP, which is an inflammatory marker,
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.740]   or dysregulated blood glucose,
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.340]   almost exclusively people who have high HDL
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.860]   will have good biomarkers of metabolic health.
[01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:34.660]   But if you take drugs that raise HDL,
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:37.540]   it doesn't reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:40.360]   In Mendelian randomization studies,
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.720]   which Mendelian randomization
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.340]   basically uses natural randomization.
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.620]   So some people are, in the case of HDL,
[01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:48.920]   naturally higher secreters
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.580]   or naturally lower secreters of HDL.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.500]   And we talked about how you can't really do
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.460]   a 20-year human randomized control trial.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   And when you're trying to examine
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.080]   something like heart disease,
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.860]   I mean, that is a lifetime exposure issue.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.420]   It's very unlikely that you're gonna pick out differences
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:07.300]   between treatments in two years or even five years.
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.860]   I mean, people don't develop,
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.420]   typically don't develop heart disease
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.140]   until they're in their 50s, 60s, and 70s.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.120]   What Mendelian randomization allows is to say,
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.680]   okay, we have these people who naturally secrete
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.300]   more or less so we can stratify those
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:25.580]   and look at what is their risk.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.340]   So if you look at people who are low secreters of HDL
[01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.440]   versus high secreters of HDL
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.220]   with holding some of the other key variables consistent,
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:36.460]   like LDL, you don't see an effect on heart disease really.
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:37.500]   - Of LDL?
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.340]   - Of HDL.
[01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:39.240]   - Got it, okay.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.980]   - But when you look at LDL
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.220]   and you look at the lifetime exposure to LDL,
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.980]   it is like a linear effect on heart disease.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.900]   And we know that it's actually not so much LDL,
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.920]   but it's more apolipoprotein B,
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.160]   but that tends to track with LDL just in general.
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.700]   And if you look at the mechanism,
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.540]   I mean, we know that LDL can penetrate the endothelium.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.180]   So there's the mechanism is present.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.320]   If we look at the epidemiology,
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.640]   it supports that it's an independent risk factor.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.960]   And then again, these Mendelian randomization studies
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.680]   where we can kind of look at people's exposure
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.420]   over a lifetime.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:19.120]   And then we see that linear kind of dose dependent effect.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.040]   To me, that was convincing enough
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.820]   to change my mind on that particular topic.
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:26.380]   And then if you look at like some of the Framingham data,
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:30.080]   look at high, if you like stratify,
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.980]   like high HDL versus low HDL,
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:37.880]   both groups looking at high LDL and low LDL.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:41.140]   So if you have high HDL, low LDL,
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:43.420]   you will still be lower risk factor
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.980]   than somebody who has high HDL and high LDL, right?
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.260]   - So the ratio does matter.
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.160]   - So the ratio does matter.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.720]   Same thing with inflammation.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.900]   If you look at people who are low inflammation,
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.040]   low LDL, they'll have a lower risk
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.560]   than people who are low inflammation, high LDL.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.920]   So again, that was kind of sufficient
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.760]   for me to change my mind.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.240]   But it took, it was like not just one study came out.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.180]   It was, okay, then there was another study
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.700]   and then another study and then another study.
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.340]   And at a certain point I go, okay,
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.340]   well now I either have to change my mind
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.580]   or I'm basically just gonna be cognitively dissonant
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.320]   and say, nope, I don't believe all that.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.240]   And so I think that's one of the things
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.460]   to keep in mind people will say,
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:26.980]   oh, you're saying this is a bad study.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.580]   Very rarely will I call something a bad study
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.240]   because data is just data.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.580]   But the issue becomes how it is presented
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.460]   and how broadly it's applied in the mainstream media
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.300]   or by people on fitness influencers.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.460]   And what I'll do is try to step in and say,
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:50.060]   okay, let's consider X, Y, and Z as well.
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.300]   And then it's not a bad study,
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.140]   but let's just be careful
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.860]   about how broadly we imply the interpretation.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:59.180]   - Yeah, well, and I think you are in a very unique
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.340]   and important position to be able to place things
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.240]   into their proper context
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.920]   because of this, for lack of a better word,
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.020]   holistic view of how the psychology placebo effects
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:15.020]   also core physiology relate to one another and so on.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.860]   In fact, I think that you're training as a biochemist
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:21.860]   and then training in nutrition with somebody who,
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:24.920]   Don Lehman, who was pushing you to focus on outcomes.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.400]   I think that's a beautiful capture of the continuum
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.520]   at which one can look at something
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.140]   because for those of you that don't know out there,
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.540]   you know a lot of laboratory studies on mice and humans,
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.580]   for instance, in the realm of biochemistry
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.580]   or in vitro studies, you'll see a change in some molecule
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.500]   can be quite traumatic.
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.060]   And then the assumption is, oh, you just take the drug
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:45.100]   that will change that molecule in a particular direction
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.740]   and then you'll get the effect you want
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:49.100]   at the whole organism level.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.020]   The person will lose weight, the person will gain muscle,
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.860]   the animal will not have Alzheimer's, et cetera,
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.420]   but it just doesn't work that way
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.780]   because of the redundancy and this interplay.
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.140]   - Well, a great example of that is,
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.920]   so my research was actually in rodents.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:06.420]   All my studies on protein metabolism
[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.280]   and leucine in particular is what we were studying.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.780]   Well, we know if you give leucine
[01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.960]   it increases muscle protein synthesis,
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.560]   but we also know if you supplement with leucine,
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.180]   people don't get more muscular.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.180]   - I was about to say, all you have to do is supplement
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.380]   with leucine? - Right, right, right.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:21.580]   And so how is that possible?
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.540]   Well, you know, muscle building is not just protein synthesis
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:26.740]   it's also the balance between synthesis and degradation.
[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:29.340]   So, and degradation just happens to be
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.180]   very, very difficult to measure.
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:35.260]   But a great example, and again, one of the cool things
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:37.900]   about my PhD was actually changed the way I ate,
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:39.580]   which I think is interesting.
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:42.060]   So before I had been like, I eat eight meals a day,
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:42.900]   eat every two hours, try to keep--
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.340]   - Eight meals a day. - Yeah, when I got
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:45.940]   to grad school. - In order to get that 30 grams
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:48.360]   of protein per meal. - Get that amino drip
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.640]   going in was the idea, right?
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.380]   Like just have an IV hooked up of amino acids.
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.140]   - Not really, folks. - Not really, yeah.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.640]   But that was kind of the concept.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   But the first study I did, we basically looked at,
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.880]   okay, a lot of people had measured the amplitude
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:08.080]   of protein synthesis in response to a meal.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.520]   We wanted to see how long does this last
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.560]   and where does it peak, right?
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.660]   And so my thought was, okay, well,
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:17.200]   it'll probably track with plasma leucine.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.840]   You give, for those that are not familiar,
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:25.020]   leucine is the amino acid that is almost exclusively
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.820]   responsible for increasing muscle protein synthesis
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:28.880]   when you eat protein.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.780]   So it's one of the branch chain amino acids.
[01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:35.360]   So we wanted to see, okay, how long does this effect last?
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.620]   So we fed these animals whey protein.
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:40.360]   And again, I thought, okay, well,
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.880]   however long plasma leucine stays up,
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:46.140]   that will be how long protein synthesis stays up.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.920]   And so we got the protein synthesis data back
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.800]   and it was peaked at 90 minutes,
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.640]   or sorry, peaked from 45 to 90 minutes
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.200]   and then was back down to baseline by 180 minutes.
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.680]   And so when I went to do the plasma leucine analysis,
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.360]   my shock was at three hours,
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.560]   plasma leucine was still plateaued out.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.040]   And I said, okay, well,
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.160]   when I look at the initiation factors,
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:09.980]   that will show me something.
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:12.820]   So for those not familiar,
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.040]   this is part of the mTOR signaling pathway.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.580]   So one of the, two of the targets of mTOR,
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.080]   when it's stimulated, leucine stimulates mTOR.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.280]   Two of the targets of mTOR are a protein compound
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.560]   called 4-eBP1.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   And then another one is called ribosomal protein S6K.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.960]   So I don't want to get into the specifics about it
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.080]   'cause it's kind of beyond the scope,
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.380]   but basically when these things are phosphorylated by mTOR,
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:43.360]   it increases the rate of translation initiation,
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.140]   which translation initiation is basically the process
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.840]   of the ribosome hooking on to the mRNA
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:51.620]   and then starting protein synthesis.
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:56.620]   So I was looking at the phosphorylation of 4-eBP1 and RPS6.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:00.360]   I was like, okay, well, I'll probably see these things
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.240]   come down at three hours, still plateaued.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.960]   And so then it was like, what is, what's going on here?
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:08.720]   So I actually kept rerunning the data
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:10.520]   and rerunning the data and rerunning the data.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.940]   And I'll never forget, I went into layman's office
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:15.080]   and this is like six months after we've done this study
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.180]   'cause this analysis takes time.
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:18.960]   I was like, so where are we with this duration study?
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.100]   I said, well, I just got to run the plasma data again
[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.800]   because it's not right.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.700]   And he's like, well, why is it not right?
[01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:29.100]   And I said, well, it just doesn't make any sense, you know?
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.360]   And I kind of went through, he's like,
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.860]   well, describe to me your technique.
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:34.880]   Like, how are you doing this?
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.160]   I described it.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.260]   And he said, well, how's your standard error?
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:39.280]   And I told him what the numbers were.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.500]   He said, it sounds like it's good data.
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:45.140]   He said, it sounds like you are trying to get the data
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.860]   to fit your conclusion and you need to change
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.020]   your conclusion to fit the data.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.020]   And that statement.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.380]   - This is why we do PhDs.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.220]   - This is why, yeah.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.280]   - You need an advisor.
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.180]   - This is why I'm so skeptical of everything
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:01.140]   because I have had so many of my ideas crushed
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.000]   by my own data, right?
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   So we actually ended up, this kind of effect,
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:11.060]   this phenomenon is called muscle protein
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.260]   synthetic refractory period.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:16.180]   So basically, like once you trigger the system,
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:18.020]   kind of runs for a defined period of time
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:21.340]   and then it takes time to essentially reset
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.340]   for lack of a better term.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:24.940]   It's also been referred to as the muscle full effect.
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.580]   But so I looked at that and said,
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:30.220]   why am I eating every two hours then?
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:33.260]   You know, and there was even a study out of Wolf's lab,
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:36.220]   like back in '99, I think, where they infused
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.540]   essential amino acids for six hours.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.900]   Protein synthesis went up, peaked at 60 minutes,
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:44.140]   came back down at 120 and never went back up again.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:47.900]   - Maybe I'm being naive, but I would have thought
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:52.460]   that if protein synthesis goes up and then comes back down,
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.620]   that eating more often would be exactly the thing
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:56.900]   you would want to do if your goal was to get
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.100]   increased protein synthesis,
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.780]   because you'd be pinging the system periodically.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:03.420]   - But the problem is the plasma amino acids
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:04.260]   are still elevated.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.140]   - So it's essentially like eating the whole way through.
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:06.980]   - Right.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:07.820]   - From the perspective of leucine.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.900]   - From the cells, yeah.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.940]   So that was one of those things where I said,
[01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.480]   you know what, I'm actually gonna eat less often,
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.700]   because like if I'm eating and three hours later,
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:18.500]   I've still got capped out plasma amino acids.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.940]   And we looked at all kinds of stuff.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.180]   Like we looked at intracellular leucine just to make sure
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.640]   that that wasn't falling off, it wasn't.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.180]   We looked at all the plasma essential amino acids
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.480]   because we were thinking, well maybe protein synthesis
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.460]   is sucking some of these amino acids out of the plasma
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.320]   and they're dropping and that's causing it
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.220]   to kind of short circuit the system.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.660]   That wasn't the case.
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:43.140]   It just, essentially what the evidence suggests,
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.120]   I think we're the only ones to show this so far.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.360]   So I'm not ready to say that this is a real effect
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.980]   because I hold out the idea that data artifacts do exist
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.660]   and you can't be totally sure.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:58.140]   But we saw an increase in AMP kinase,
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.140]   kind of around this mark where protein synthesis
[01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:02.980]   started falling off.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:06.780]   And we also saw a decrease in intracellular ATP.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.460]   And protein synthesis is an ATP dependent process.
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:13.380]   And so what we think might be happening is
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:19.580]   you're consuming protein and you're increasing
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.180]   muscle protein synthesis and then at a certain point
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:28.340]   it has enough effect on your energy metabolism
[01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:33.340]   and your cells that it kind of cuts it off, right?
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:38.380]   So again, we're the only ones to show that
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.140]   that I'm aware of and that was again in rats.
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:44.840]   So I always talk about data like there's data
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.100]   I'm willing to bet my toe on, my foot on,
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.440]   my leg on and my life on.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.680]   I'd probably barely bet the end of my little toe
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.340]   on that one, I'm not quite sure.
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.480]   But it's interesting nonetheless.
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:58.720]   So that's a great example of, okay,
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.600]   we're looking at this mechanism of mTOR signaling.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.440]   And if we just looked at that we'd say,
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:05.360]   oh, well protein synthesis is gonna stay elevated
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.260]   for past three hours, but that's not what we saw.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.840]   So yeah, I think it's again, that's why I really try
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.320]   to get people to say, well, mechanisms are important.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.060]   And especially if you're seeing an outcome,
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:21.520]   it's important to identify mechanisms that may explain that.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:23.340]   But let's step back from the mechanisms
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.900]   from trying to chase mechanisms
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:26.840]   and let's look at like chasing outcomes
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.240]   in terms of what we recommend to people.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.680]   - Excellent point.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.600]   In terms of chasing outcomes, a number of people I know
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:36.680]   are interested in weight loss or weight maintenance.
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.440]   And several times throughout today's conversation,
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.000]   we've come back to this issue of satiety signals,
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.760]   whether or not they're brain-based, body-based or both.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.280]   Not wanting to eat more is a great way to maintain
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.520]   or lose weight because you simply don't want to.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.660]   I heard you mentioned earlier that protein
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.720]   and maybe specific types of protein or sources of protein
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:00.400]   may provide better satiety signals
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.900]   than other macronutrients.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:06.580]   Could you briefly talk about how macronutrients,
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:10.500]   including protein, but also carbohydrates and fats
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:14.840]   impact satiety and from the standpoint of somebody who,
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.040]   for instance, would like to quote unquote,
[01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.240]   lose a few pounds, right?
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.200]   Probably would be happy to gain a little bit
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:22.920]   of lean body mass provided it was in a particular location
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.760]   on their body.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.080]   That seems to be a thing now,
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.260]   directed hypertrophy, if you will.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:32.100]   And how much they should focus on protein
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.200]   as a core component of creating this diet.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.300]   Assuming everything else is being done correctly,
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:39.940]   they're going to hit the right number of calories
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:43.780]   relative to their output, meat, et cetera.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:47.480]   How should we think about protein and satiety signals?
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.880]   And are animal sources of protein indeed more bioavailable?
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.360]   That's a tricky word.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.900]   For sake of muscle building,
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:57.040]   but also for sake of somebody
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.040]   who just would like to lose body fat.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.140]   They don't want to lose muscle
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.360]   and they'd like to bring their weight down a few pounds.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.700]   - So a lot of things- - Or more.
[01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.560]   - Yeah, a lot of things to unpack there.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.800]   Of the macronutrients, protein is definitely
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.280]   the biggest lever that you can pull.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.640]   Because even if, you know,
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.140]   it doesn't take a ton of protein
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:13.720]   to get a lot of the muscle building benefits.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.540]   I mean, I think the benefits really start to plateau out
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:19.720]   around 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.380]   There's some evidence that maybe even up to like 2.4
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:26.220]   or 2.8 grams per kilo may give like
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.720]   a little bit more benefit.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:30.160]   I think it probably looks something like an asymptote
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.560]   in terms of a curve where as you put more into the system,
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.060]   you always get a little bit more,
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.180]   but it just gets to the point
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:38.240]   where it's so infinitesimally small benefit
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.360]   that it's for all intensive purposes, no benefit.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.960]   - But you mentioned 1.6 grams of protein
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.480]   per kilogram of body weight.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.420]   Would you consider that a threshold
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.660]   that most people should try and achieve daily?
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:52.880]   - I see very few downsides to hitting that.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:54.400]   I mean, I know some people,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:55.940]   and this is gonna get into a separate conversation,
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.780]   but I know some people will say,
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.900]   "Well, I don't wanna stimulate mTOR
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.340]   because that's gonna make me die early."
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.600]   And I think one of the things to keep in mind
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.100]   is if you look at,
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.500]   there's kind of this thought process out there
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.700]   that if you're stimulating mTOR,
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.200]   that protein is gonna make you die early.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.660]   And first off, we have very little human outcome data
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.620]   to support that claim.
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.800]   And the second thing is
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.740]   if you look at any macronutrient isolation,
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.220]   I can make a mechanistic argument
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.440]   that it's gonna kill you.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.460]   So fat, if you take in fat,
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:26.000]   it decreases flow-mediated dilation.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.660]   Flow-mediated dilation is important for heart health
[01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.200]   in the short term.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.820]   Carbohydrates stimulate insulin.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:37.720]   Insulin, pro-inflammatory and all these other things.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:41.560]   And so I can make an argument for any single macronutrient
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.880]   to be negative for longevity.
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:47.020]   I really want people,
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:49.180]   this is something that even scientists get wrong.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:51.480]   They look at an acute response of something
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.460]   and assume that that is going to relate
[01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:55.320]   to long-term outcomes and signaling.
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.540]   So let's just take exercise, for example.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.640]   If I, if you didn't know anything about exercise
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.000]   and I said to you,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.180]   "Andrew, I'm gonna do something that's gonna make you,
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.620]   your heart rate go up, your blood pressure go up,
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.420]   your inflammatory markers go up,
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.140]   your reactive oxygen species increase."
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:17.460]   You're gonna say, "And it's gonna damage your muscles."
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.060]   You're gonna say, "I'm not doing that.
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.180]   That sounds horrible."
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:23.880]   You know, but it does all those things in the short term.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.820]   But what is the long-term effect of exercise?
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.520]   You actually get healthier.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520]   All those things improve.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:31.740]   Now, I'm not saying that, you know,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.180]   protein is a longevity hack or anything like that,
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:37.220]   but what I'm saying is I think some of the arguments
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:40.060]   out there based on mechanistic, you know,
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.460]   this increases mTOR, therefore we don't wanna do it,
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.100]   I think it is a much more complicated argument
[01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.900]   than just that.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:48.940]   So there's that.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:50.140]   So protein is the biggest lever.
[01:41:50.140 --> 01:41:53.080]   I would shoot for 1.6, you know, grams per kilogram.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.540]   If you can do more, great.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:56.400]   There doesn't seem to be really downsides to it.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.620]   Even like up to very high levels of protein.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:00.660]   Jose Antonio did a study
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.780]   that was a year-long randomized control trial.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.920]   And again, it's just one year,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.300]   but they were looking at all sorts of different biomarkers.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.900]   And basically even up to like four grams per kilogram
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.580]   of protein, they couldn't really find
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.660]   any negative health outcomes from it.
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:16.700]   Other than people were just so satiated,
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.580]   they ended up eating less calories.
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:23.460]   So protein is a big lever because one,
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.300]   it has a higher thermic effect of food.
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.060]   So you're getting a little bit more calorie burn per day,
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:29.860]   even though it's not a ton because TEF
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:30.980]   is a pretty small percentage
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:34.620]   of your overall energy expenditure, but still a benefit.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.340]   You're getting the effects on lean body mass.
[01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:37.580]   It's gonna, if you're in a diet,
[01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:38.980]   it's gonna help preserve lean body mass.
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.840]   If you're at maintenance,
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.940]   it's gonna help build or preserve lean body mass.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:42.780]   And if you're in a surplus,
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:45.180]   it's gonna help build or preserve lean body mass.
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:48.120]   Then you get the effects on appetite.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.100]   So now I wanna be careful
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:55.100]   because appetite effects tend to be very specific
[01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.400]   to individual foods, right?
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.980]   So you can take a high protein food
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:05.980]   and make it not very, not very satiating.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.460]   So take, for example, like a really tasty protein bar,
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:11.580]   which, you know, back when we were getting into this,
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.620]   there, no such thing existed.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.060]   Now you have protein bars actually take pretty darn good.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.380]   But if you eat one of them, I mean,
[01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:19.420]   are you really satiated?
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:21.780]   I don't really feel satiated for a protein bar.
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:23.180]   - That's my pre-meal snack.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:24.680]   - Right, right.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.300]   So why?
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:29.100]   Because, I mean, it's processed, refined,
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:32.400]   and made to be very palatable, okay?
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.940]   But take something like a 200 gram chicken breast.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.460]   Very satiating, right?
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.180]   And that's why when people say,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:40.660]   well, carbohydrates aren't very satiating.
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:41.900]   Depends on the carbohydrate.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.420]   I mean, when you look at the like the satiety index,
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:49.140]   a plain baked potato is about as satiating as it gets.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.620]   - If I eat a bowl of oatmeal,
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:54.300]   I feel pretty good afterward for a while, right?
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.940]   I mean, I usually I'll eat that along with some other things,
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:59.280]   but I completely agree.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.260]   So you're saying that the form that it comes in,
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.500]   maybe even how much chewing is required,
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:08.780]   how good it smells, that your psychological associations,
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:13.080]   'cause to me, a steak is an incredible meal.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.960]   Like, I mean, if I had to pick one food that I could eat,
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.580]   even though I'm not pure carnivore,
[01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:18.940]   for the rest of my life, it would be that,
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.660]   because I think it would get me where I need to go,
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:23.700]   and then I'd probably have to sneak some fiber, you know?
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:26.020]   But it's an excellent point.
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:28.780]   I have a question that I don't want to take us off track,
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:30.220]   but I'm hoping it relates enough
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:33.540]   that you could answer it now in the context of this.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:36.660]   If I'm going to eat, let's say two grams per kilogram
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:40.240]   of body weight protein, and I'm not eating multiple meals,
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.540]   maybe I'm eating two or three meals per day,
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.020]   I'm certainly going to be eating more
[01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:46.740]   than the 30 gram threshold that was thrown around
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.660]   for a long time, that we can only assimilate 30 grams
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:49.980]   of protein per meal.
[01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:51.160]   Should I just not worry about that?
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.000]   Some of it is going to go
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.740]   towards the thermic effect of food.
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.260]   Some of that might be converted into glucose of all things,
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:58.900]   through gluconeogenesis.
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.260]   So should I worry about this 30 gram cutoff?
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:04.540]   Because I think balancing the 1.6 gram per kilogram
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.600]   body weight threshold with number of meals,
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.180]   with the need to exercise and work
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:09.700]   and live my life and sleep, et cetera,
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.100]   pretty soon you run into bottlenecks
[01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:13.500]   where you just can't do it all,
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.220]   or you're spending so much time trying to focus on it all.
[01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:17.460]   - You can't optimize all the things at the same time.
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.500]   - You'd lose your mind and your body.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:24.500]   So what is necessary in terms of frequency
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:28.220]   if one is getting enough protein?
[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:30.640]   And then tied into that question,
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.420]   is there any reality to this idea
[01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:36.340]   that if you eat one meal per day or you're fasting
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:40.380]   and then you eat, let's say 200 grams of protein
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:44.200]   in a single feeding that you can assimilate more
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.740]   because you were sort of protein starved?
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.040]   Is that a real thing?
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.940]   - So most of the studies with protein are after a fast,
[01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.600]   like because to assess it with stable isotope,
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.800]   you have to be in a steady state.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.060]   So we haven't observed that.
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.300]   It doesn't appear that fasting really kind of allows you
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:07.420]   to assimilate more protein after a fast.
[01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:09.420]   So this gets into a core of one of the things
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.780]   I looked at in my PhD,
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.180]   which is does protein distribution matter?
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.780]   Because most Americans get about 65 to 70%
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.500]   of their protein at dinner, right?
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.220]   Breakfast tends to be pretty minimal protein foods.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:24.560]   - Do any cultures actually eat a big breakfast
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:26.940]   and not a big lunch and dinner?
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:28.500]   We all heard that that was ideal.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:30.340]   We'll get into circadian timing in a little bit,
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.920]   but does anyone actually do that?
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.980]   Steak and eggs for breakfast
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:34.940]   and then taper off the rest of the day?
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:37.140]   - I know German culture tends to have a big breakfast,
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.600]   but it also tends to be like sugary foods and whatnot.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.620]   As far as like teleologically,
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.980]   I'm actually not sure about that.
[01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:46.940]   So if you look at that and then you consider
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:50.640]   that protein doesn't really have a storage mechanism, right?
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:53.140]   Like people will say, well, lean tissue
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.600]   is a storage mechanism.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.980]   That's like saying a house is a storage facility for wood.
[01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.760]   Yeah, if the house is made out of wood,
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.960]   you could get wood out of it,
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.720]   but that's not why you build the house, right?
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.400]   Like you're building the house out of a demand,
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:07.840]   same thing for muscle tissue.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.980]   There is a free pool of amino acids,
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:12.580]   but it's very, very small.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.900]   So when you consider things like fat,
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.880]   which basically has unlimited storage capacity,
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:19.660]   carbohydrate, a relatively large storage capacity.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.060]   You can store four or 500 grams of carbohydrate
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.380]   between your liver and muscles.
[01:47:24.380 --> 01:47:28.320]   And then protein, which almost has no storage capacity.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.300]   The idea that, okay, you could make up for a low protein
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.740]   at one meal by over-consuming another meal
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.600]   didn't make sense to me.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.800]   So one of the studies we did, and again, in rats,
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:47.800]   we took, both groups were getting whey protein,
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.580]   so high quality protein.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:52.580]   They were getting the exact same amount of calories,
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:56.580]   exact same amount of nitrogen, exact same macros.
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.420]   Everything was the same.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:48:01.080]   The only difference was one group basically got
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.260]   kind of three meals of similar amounts of protein.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.960]   Like dinner was a little bit bigger,
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.620]   because we wanted to keep it somewhat similar
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.500]   to how people eat, but each meal was gonna be
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:13.020]   over the threshold to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:15.860]   Whereas the other group, I constructed it
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:17.940]   so the first two meals of the day
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.980]   should not stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.460]   It should be under that threshold.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.300]   And then the last meal was about 70%
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.780]   of the total daily protein.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.460]   And so we had them eat those for 11 weeks.
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.620]   And I'll never forget this.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:31.620]   This is how obsessive I became about it is,
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:33.660]   there was 110 animals in this study,
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:37.740]   and I made all the diets, and I weighed out
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.460]   exactly every single meal for every single animal
[01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:41.740]   for 11 weeks.
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:44.820]   So I was in there at 6 a.m., I was in there at noon,
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:46.580]   and then I was in there at 6 p.m.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.380]   - I love it, that's a kind of PhD student
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:53.100]   that professors dream of, you guys aren't a dream student.
[01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:57.220]   - So at the end of 11 weeks, we looked at lean body mass,
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:02.220]   we looked at body fat, we looked at hind limb weights.
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:06.100]   We didn't really see differences in lean body mass,
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:08.540]   but what we did see was a difference in hind limb weights.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.020]   It wasn't massive, but there was a significant difference
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.800]   in the size of the muscles of the hind limbs
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.380]   of these animals.
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.460]   And so it was interesting that there wasn't a difference
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.420]   in lean body mass, and what we found,
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.340]   at least with the liver, the animals that were eating
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:28.620]   the one meal with really high protein
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:32.480]   actually had bigger livers, not a huge amount,
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.080]   and not something that I would consider unsafe,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.180]   but it was a statistically significant difference.
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:40.760]   And so to me, at least, if I'm trying to explain
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.140]   no difference in lean body mass,
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:44.380]   but a difference in these hind limb weights,
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.160]   maybe there's some sequestering of,
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.660]   that's fueling a little bit more protein synthesis
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.200]   of the splanchnic tissues rather than,
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:58.140]   'cause you're capping out skeletal muscle protein synthesis.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.960]   And we do know that the splanchnic tissues
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.660]   are more sensitive or have a greater rate
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:04.060]   of protein synthesis per day.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:06.600]   The rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in humans
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.200]   is about 1% per day.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.140]   So it takes like 100 days to turn over skeletal muscle,
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:15.740]   whereas your entire gut, your entire GI
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:18.180]   will turn itself over in like two to three days, right?
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:21.640]   So really, and the liver also has a very high amount
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.900]   of protein synthesis, which is one of the reasons
[01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:26.740]   it's actually one of the most metabolically active organs.
[01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:31.380]   So all that to say, there's been one human study
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:32.940]   that showed something similar,
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:36.020]   and then there's been a couple others that didn't.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.340]   And then in the intermittent fasting studies,
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.500]   which is maybe a good tool to look at
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:45.500]   compared to continuous feeding, one thing I will say
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.260]   is it looks like the 16-8 intermittent fasting style.
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:52.400]   There's been a couple studies with Grant Tinsley,
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.820]   and this is something I've changed my mind on as well.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.260]   Grant Tinsley has done a couple studies
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.460]   where they used the 16-8 protocol.
[01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:01.540]   They had them train during their feeding window,
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:03.500]   and they had them eat, I think it was at least
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.020]   three protein-containing meals during that eight hours.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.060]   - These are humans? - These are humans.
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:10.080]   And they saw no difference in lean body mass
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.420]   at the end of the study compared to people
[01:51:11.420 --> 01:51:14.780]   who were eating as many times as they wanted
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.460]   throughout the day.
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:21.320]   Now, if you look at some of the more extreme forms
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:23.700]   of fasting, like alternate day fasting,
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:28.700]   or like 22-2 or 24, there are some studies
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:31.480]   where you do start to see differences in lean body mass.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.740]   So my suspicion is, and I'm just guessing,
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:38.980]   so this is tenuous, my suspicion is probably
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:43.460]   if you're getting two to three high-quality protein meals
[01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:46.160]   in a day, you're getting the vast majority
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.560]   of the benefits of protein.
[01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.660]   The most important thing is getting enough total.
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.360]   And then secondarily, trying to get at least two
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.200]   or three meals with high-quality protein in.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.680]   But if you're going pretty extreme
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:04.300]   with alternate day fasting or maybe only one meal a day,
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:07.080]   then I think there may be some effects on lean body mass.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.340]   But again, these can be mitigated as well
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.580]   if you're doing hard resistance training.
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:14.920]   Typically, that is the biggest lever
[01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.140]   in terms of lean body mass.
[01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.540]   Yes, protein distribution may make a difference,
[01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:20.060]   but I'm trying to put it in context
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:21.260]   so people don't feel like they need to go out
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:22.640]   and eat four meals a day.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.980]   But again, so what I would say is,
[01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.880]   some of the more milder forms of time-restricted eating
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:31.540]   appear to be fine for lean body mass.
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.460]   Now, the caveat is the following.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:38.100]   One of the nice things about animal studies
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:40.740]   is when you consider if you wanna have
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:43.660]   a high subject number, high level of control,
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:47.820]   and a long duration, it's pretty much your only option.
[01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:53.780]   In our research review reps, I created a Venn diagram,
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:57.740]   which basically is like three circles crossing over.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:02.740]   One is study duration, one is level of control,
[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:05.980]   and the other one is subject number.
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.700]   To get all three of those circles to cross over,
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.600]   it almost has to be in animals.
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:14.100]   - And reps, it's a newsletter or a book?
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.760]   - So it's our monthly research review.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:21.020]   So every month we review five studies that come out
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:22.860]   in fitness and nutrition.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:25.180]   We'll usually do at least one nutrition,
[01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:27.980]   one training, and one supplement per month.
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.240]   - We will put a link to where people can sign up.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:32.100]   This is a sign-up format?
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:35.180]   - Great, yeah, so it's a subscription-based service.
[01:53:35.180 --> 01:53:40.180]   So basically, when people might look at my study,
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:43.380]   well, why did you see a difference in muscle weights,
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.860]   whereas some of these other studies don't see a difference?
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:50.500]   I wait out every single meal for 11 weeks,
[01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:54.460]   and keep in mind that 11 weeks in a rodent's lifespan
[01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.580]   is a really long time.
[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.220]   That's about an eighth of their total lifespan.
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:03.040]   So is it that there's no effect,
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:06.540]   or is it that the effect is relatively small
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:08.860]   and would take a really long time
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:12.420]   and very high level of control to see in humans?
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:15.860]   I don't know, but I think what I would say,
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.540]   relatively confidently, is if you're gonna do
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:21.820]   like a 16/8 intermittent fasting, you're probably fine.
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:25.220]   Especially, and again, what is the goal, right?
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.220]   Like if you're a bodybuilder looking to be
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:29.620]   the most massive person you possibly can,
[01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:33.480]   or you're a football player, or you're in some field
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.340]   that having as much lean body mass as possible
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:38.820]   is really important for you, then I would say,
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:40.500]   well, you're not really gaining a whole lot
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.220]   by doing some form of time-restricted eating.
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:43.820]   - I think most of the people listening to this
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:45.740]   do not fall into that category.
[01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:48.380]   I think most people want to maintain or lose weight.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:51.240]   They'd like to perhaps add a bit of, quote-unquote,
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:53.300]   shape or muscle to specific areas of their body
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.860]   and lose body fat.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:57.540]   - Right, and I think your normal forms of time-restricted eating
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.180]   are probably perfectly fine for that, right?
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:01.800]   And again, I don't want somebody to think,
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.380]   well, I do alternate-day fasting.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:06.780]   There's no point to be resistance training
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:08.380]   'cause I'm gonna lose muscle mass.
[01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:11.580]   You can still build muscle doing that.
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:13.580]   You just might not build as much muscle as you would
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:15.580]   if you were eating in a more traditional format.
[01:55:15.580 --> 01:55:18.020]   But if that's something that works for you and your goals,
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:19.320]   and especially if it's fat loss
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:21.680]   or controlling your calories, then again,
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:24.540]   it's about the hierarchy of what's important, right?
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:27.000]   So to answer your question,
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.740]   I do think that timing and frequency matters.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:32.340]   Not so much frequency, but distribution more so.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:34.780]   So I think the distribution matters,
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:36.960]   but it's a much smaller lever
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:39.140]   than just getting enough total protein in.
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.520]   And then as far as like animal versus plant,
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.660]   I used to be in the camp of there's no way
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.180]   somebody can build as much muscle on a plant-based diet.
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:50.720]   And now I think I've come back to you can,
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.120]   it just requires a little bit more planning.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.040]   And I don't wanna say always,
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:59.500]   but it's very difficult to do
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.300]   without an isolated source of protein.
[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:02.420]   So unless you're gonna supplement
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:04.420]   with an isolated plant source of protein,
[01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:07.100]   it's very difficult to get enough
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:08.980]   without going over on total calories,
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.380]   because you can figure that,
[01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.460]   especially like take somebody
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.580]   who may be calorically restricted,
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:14.700]   trying to get enough protein
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.460]   from whole intact plant sources.
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:19.100]   So you've got a few different things working against you.
[01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:21.340]   One, the sources of protein you're consuming
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:23.380]   also have carbohydrate and or fat.
[01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:27.180]   Two, it's a less bioavailable form of protein.
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:29.060]   And three, it's a lower quality of protein
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:31.360]   in terms of it has typically less leucine,
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.200]   less branched amino acids and less essential amino acids.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.020]   - You answered the question
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.860]   that I almost interrupted you to ask,
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.340]   which was, does it boil down to the leucine content?
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:43.340]   And it sounds like that is one of the components
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:46.440]   and that a lot of the vegan and vegetarian sources
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.340]   of excellent protein,
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:51.460]   that excellent protein, vegetarian or vegan source
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:54.860]   is co-packaged with calories from carbohydrates
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:57.580]   and or fat that make it hard to stay
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.220]   under the caloric threshold.
[01:56:59.220 --> 01:57:00.640]   Whereas a steak is, I'm not,
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:02.340]   and obviously people might want to avoid that
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:03.620]   for ethical reasons,
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:05.000]   but that's a different matter entirely,
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.620]   but a steak or a piece of chicken or an egg is,
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:11.000]   well, an egg has a yolk, which is there's fat there,
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.180]   but is almost a pure protein fat source.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.240]   There's no carbohydrate alone for the ride.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:17.080]   - Right.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:19.740]   So I think what I would say is that you can do it,
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.400]   it takes a little more planning,
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.260]   and you're almost always, if you're a vegan especially,
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:26.100]   you're gonna be better off
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:29.420]   like supplementing with some isolated form of protein
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:30.700]   or vegan form of protein.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.580]   Now, this is where it gets into people say,
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:34.380]   well, what about the limiting amino acids
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.320]   and those sorts of things?
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.580]   It's a consideration.
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:41.740]   Some of the better forms of vegan protein
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:45.120]   in terms of amino acid content are like soy.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:47.700]   Now, I hear everybody's screaming online
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.460]   about their testosterone levels.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:52.780]   In terms of actual outcomes and looking at testosterone,
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:56.180]   there was a recent meta-analysis looking at soy.
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.220]   And I think if it's your only source of protein,
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:01.700]   then maybe the dosage is high enough
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:03.320]   to cause some weird effects.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:06.340]   But if you're just using it like once or twice a day,
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:09.060]   doesn't seem to have an effect on testosterone or estrogen.
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:12.100]   So that can be a decent source of protein
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:14.660]   because it is a complete protein source.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:16.080]   It does have a PD-CAUSE of one,
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:21.080]   which PD-CAUSE is basically a measure of protein quality
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:26.240]   based on does it provide enough of all the amino acids
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.580]   so that none are limiting?
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:30.640]   And so soy is one of the only vegan sources that does that.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:33.060]   Interestingly, potato protein isolate
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:36.640]   actually has a similar essential amino acid content to whey.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:39.480]   So isolated potato protein, it's just really hard to find.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:40.320]   I've been trying to source it.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.160]   - But vegans take note, vegetarians take note because,
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:46.060]   or vegans rather, 'cause whey is vegetarian.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:49.240]   And whey is a very high quality protein source.
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:50.440]   - Very high quality protein source.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.800]   And actually, they're actually creating whey now out of,
[01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.960]   I think it's, I may mischaracterize this,
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:59.080]   but I believe they're able to produce it
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:00.840]   out of like yeast or something like that.
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.240]   - Amazing.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:04.820]   - So for vegans, now this is a great option
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:08.140]   because you can have whey that's not animal-based
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:11.360]   that is gonna be every bit as good as an animal-based whey.
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:12.560]   So I think that's great.
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:17.320]   Getting to the leucine, let me go back, sorry.
[01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:20.640]   So another reason that using an isolated protein
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:25.060]   can be helpful is because it's more bioavailable as well,
[01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:26.560]   when it's been isolated out.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:30.140]   When it's the protein bound up in the actual plant material,
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:31.560]   it tends to be less bioavailable.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:35.020]   Now, cooking can help increase the bioavailability
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:37.280]   'cause it breaks some of those bonds and whatnot,
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:38.880]   but it still seems to be lower.
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:42.580]   And you don't, it's really interesting,
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:46.660]   there was a recent study where they did a corn, wheat,
[01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:50.180]   and pea blend of protein versus whey.
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:55.180]   And basically the outcome was 30 grams of each,
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:57.680]   stimulated protein synthesis to a similar degree.
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:04.120]   But the plasma amino acids in the plant-based protein
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:07.000]   still did not get as high as with whey.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.020]   Now, it may be that that's just, it doesn't matter
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:11.520]   because once you get to a certain level,
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.440]   you get all the benefits.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:15.640]   So, but I still found it interesting nonetheless
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.340]   that they didn't quite get as high.
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:21.980]   The other thing to consider with the vegan sources
[02:00:21.980 --> 02:00:23.580]   of protein is the leucine content.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:27.300]   So one of the studies we did was we looked at wheat,
[02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:31.200]   soy, egg, and whey, isonitrogenous,
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:34.520]   meaning we equated protein between the groups,
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.720]   isocaloric, we equated calories,
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:40.600]   and we looked at muscle protein synthesis.
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:44.040]   And I think this was, the meals were 15%
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.840]   of total energy from protein.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.040]   So like your food guide pyramid level of protein.
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:53.400]   And we saw that in the wheat and soy group,
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.480]   they did not increase muscle protein synthesis,
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.180]   but the egg and whey group
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:59.020]   increased muscle protein synthesis.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:04.300]   Now, what's really interesting is we went back
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.440]   and we took wheat and added free leucine to it
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.760]   to match the leucine content of whey,
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.700]   and the protein synthetic response was identical.
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:16.540]   So again, I don't like to simplify things too much,
[02:01:16.540 --> 02:01:21.540]   but leucine appears to really be driving this ship.
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:24.520]   And I'll never forget,
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:26.380]   layman called me into his office one day,
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:29.320]   and he would always do these like thought experiments of,
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:32.520]   he liked to think about why something occurs
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.360]   the way it does.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.580]   - Dangerous, dangerous territory.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:37.500]   - Yeah, so he would say, one day, I'll never forget,
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:39.740]   he said, "Lane, why do you think the body evolved
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:42.980]   "to just sense leucine for muscle protein synthesis?"
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:46.600]   And of course I'm like, "Uh, I don't know, man,
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:50.180]   "I just work here, like I'm just trying to get my PhD."
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:52.860]   And he said, "Well, think about it.
[02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:54.540]   "You would want something that really wasn't
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.920]   "extensively metabolized by the gut and liver
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.700]   "because you would want it to show up in the blood
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.060]   "in values that reflect what you just ate."
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:03.340]   Makes sense.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:05.900]   And you would want it to have passive diffusion
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:06.860]   across the muscle cell
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:08.940]   because you'd want it to be concentration dependent,
[02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:09.820]   which it is.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.640]   - Get into the tissues and cells that need it most.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.300]   - Right, so not having active transport,
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:18.300]   but rather passive transport.
[02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:19.860]   So yeah, I thought that that was really interesting
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:20.860]   the way he broke that down.
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:25.260]   So few different options for the vegan folks out there.
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:27.940]   You can use an isolated source of protein.
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.780]   And again, there's gonna be good options coming
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:32.180]   because this plant-based whey is gonna be a great option
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:33.020]   for folks.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:37.300]   You can add free leucine to it,
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.140]   to whatever your source of protein is.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.820]   - Just buy supplemented leucine powder.
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:44.540]   - Now it tastes horrible.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:45.540]   - Yeah, I think I've heard that.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.860]   Maybe I've even tried it.
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:49.220]   - It's completely non-polar, does not dissolve in anything.
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.940]   - Can it be put into capsules?
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:52.100]   - It can be put into capsules, yeah.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:54.660]   So you could take a capsule, like for example,
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:56.520]   if you're eating your normal meal,
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.820]   you could just take a capsule of like one gram of leucine,
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.180]   it's probably gonna bump you up enough
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:02.780]   that you're gonna be good to go.
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:08.620]   And then there's options like blends, especially with corn.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.620]   Corn is actually very high in leucine
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.340]   as a percentage of its protein.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:15.220]   Now you gotta remember like you go eat corn on a cob
[02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.060]   and you're getting like two grams of total protein,
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:18.460]   so it's not that much leucine.
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:21.880]   But if you isolate out the protein, put it into a powder,
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.020]   well now, when you're getting like 80, 90% of the weight
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:28.500]   is now protein, corn is actually about 12% leucine
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:30.000]   in terms of the protein.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.300]   So a great source of leucine,
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.720]   it is like almost frank deficient in some other amino acids,
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:36.900]   but you can blend it with a few other sources of protein,
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:40.120]   like you could blend it with a soy, a pea,
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:42.780]   and you can create these complementary blends
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:44.860]   that would actually have quite a bit of leucine,
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:46.560]   but also some of the other essential amino acids.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:49.200]   So there are options out there for plant-based folks.
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:52.500]   And I mean, we have seen people who are plant-based
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:55.260]   build impressive amounts of muscle.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:57.340]   There's quite a few bodybuilders that are plant-based.
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:59.100]   - And a lot of the endurance athletes like it.
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:01.940]   And even though when we talk about muscle,
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:04.620]   we think about muscle building often,
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:06.480]   performance in endurance sports,
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.860]   and also just performance for the typical person
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:10.620]   who's doing some cardiovascular training,
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:12.620]   hopefully some resistance training also,
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:13.900]   and just living life.
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:16.660]   I mean, many more people now it seems are vegan
[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:19.940]   or at least avoiding meat in particular, red meat.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:21.500]   I'm not one of those people.
[02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:24.700]   I limit the amount and I certainly focus on the quality
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:27.460]   of what I eat, but I do eat red meat.
[02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:31.780]   Which brings me to a question about,
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:35.140]   just generally in terms of food choice,
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:39.300]   can we come up with a relatively short summary
[02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:40.160]   of the following?
[02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:42.500]   Tell me if this is correct or not.
[02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.860]   That most of us should be focused on,
[02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:48.580]   for sake of health, health span and lifespan,
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:53.540]   should be focused on ingesting minimally,
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:56.180]   non-processed and minimally processed foods,
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:58.060]   and maybe even cooking our own food.
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:59.280]   I realize that's heresy now,
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.740]   but ideally we would do some of that.
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:05.260]   And really trying to avoid foods that are highly processed
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.620]   and have lots of sugar.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:09.020]   And I'm using this as a segue to get into a question
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.140]   that I really want your answer to.
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:13.340]   I've been dying to ask you this,
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:18.340]   which is if a sugar intake is not actually going up
[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.540]   as much as people think it is,
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:22.940]   why are people getting so much fatter?
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:27.580]   So what do you think about just a general statement
[02:05:27.580 --> 02:05:32.340]   that we should try and eat foods that are low to no,
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:35.740]   minimally to not processed, for about 80% of our foods?
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.060]   Is that a reasonable number?
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:39.860]   - It's hard to actually get completely unprocessed food
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:40.920]   'cause almost everything goes through
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:41.900]   some form of processing.
[02:05:41.900 --> 02:05:45.300]   - So I'm thinking like anything that wouldn't survive long
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:47.420]   on refrigerators, yeah, on a shelf,
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:49.980]   like an apple or a banana or something, oatmeal,
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:51.740]   like ground oats to me,
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:53.060]   as long as there isn't a bunch of other stuff
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:54.940]   and they would be minimally processed.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:56.580]   A steak is not really processed,
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.740]   although it's cut off the animal, et cetera.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.600]   So there's a few steps in there,
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:03.120]   but that's what I mean.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:06.140]   - Yeah, and I think everybody kind of gets the gist.
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:07.780]   I'm probably a little bit pedantic
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:08.780]   when it comes to this stuff.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.620]   - No, this is good.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:12.260]   Actually, one of the things I appreciate about you
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:14.940]   is something that I get teased a lot by people close to me,
[02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:18.560]   which is the caveats and the insistence on precision
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.220]   is really important because,
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.260]   especially with online communications these days,
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.700]   it's like a runaway train.
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:29.660]   - It's too easy to misinterpret what you're saying.
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:30.900]   - Very easy to misinterpret.
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:32.740]   And the misinterpretations are often used
[02:06:32.740 --> 02:06:35.580]   to leverage whole new ideas about what is and isn't true,
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.760]   mostly about what is true.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:39.660]   So I really appreciate the nuance.
[02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:41.980]   And this is what a long form podcast really allows us to do
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:44.480]   is catch every curve.
[02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.980]   - So I would 100% agree with what you said
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:50.700]   that if you were gonna make a broad stroke,
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:53.260]   that trying to focus on mentally processed foods
[02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:55.040]   is very important.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.820]   The one caveat I would say is,
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.700]   I think it's important to understand why,
[02:06:58.700 --> 02:07:01.160]   because otherwise people can make this weird association
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:05.900]   that if I eat any processed food, it's gonna kill me,
[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:08.780]   or every time I eat it, it's like I'm smoking a cigarette
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:11.480]   and my health, my longevity is declining.
[02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:15.180]   Based on the studies we have,
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:20.180]   it's mostly about the energy that processed food
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:23.180]   just gets people to spontaneously eat more.
[02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:27.980]   And Kevin Hull showed this in his study that was very,
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:30.460]   he designed some of the most elegant studies in nutrition.
[02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:31.300]   - He's great.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:33.700]   - And they basically took people
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:36.620]   from a minimally processed food diet
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:39.580]   and then gave them access to ultra-processed foods,
[02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:42.440]   very few instructions, just eat till you feel satisfied,
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:44.380]   and they spontaneously increased their calorie intake
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.260]   by 500 calories a day.
[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:48.680]   I mean, that's massive.
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:52.660]   So, and we haven't quite figured it out.
[02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:55.180]   People say, well, it's sugar.
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:57.080]   It doesn't appear to be sugar
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.060]   in terms of just an isolation.
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.140]   Well, it's fats.
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:01.460]   Doesn't appear to be fats in isolation.
[02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:04.100]   Well, it's the combination of sugar and fat.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:07.660]   Partly, well, it's the combination of sugar, fat, and salt.
[02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:11.040]   Partly, but there's some kind of like overall magic
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.180]   to the texture and the mouth feel
[02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:15.340]   and just the overall palatability of stuff,
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.480]   which is always why I say there's like right and wrong ways
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:18.320]   to do these different diets.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:21.140]   Like for example, there's a right way to do plant-based,
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.260]   and then there's like what's in some of these documentaries
[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:26.660]   where they're eating like plant-based mac and cheese.
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:28.780]   And again, I love a good mac and cheese,
[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:30.820]   but like that should not form,
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:32.500]   like that should not be pitched as a healthy diet
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.820]   just because it's plant-based, right?
[02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:37.500]   Because I mean, you're eating a highly processed food
[02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.980]   that's very palatable and easy to overeat.
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:40.840]   Same thing for keto.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:42.500]   You've now got like keto ice creams
[02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:45.620]   and you've got keto cookies and all these sorts of things.
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:47.860]   And I'm like, yeah.
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:48.700]   And if you look at them,
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:50.660]   they actually have more calories than the normal stuff.
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:51.860]   And I'm like, yeah,
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.680]   this is completely missing the point here.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.740]   Like you're actually just taking yourself,
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:59.300]   like the whole point of those diets is the reason
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:02.780]   you tend to lose weight is originally like good luck,
[02:09:02.780 --> 02:09:05.580]   you know, 10 years ago doing a keto diet
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.460]   eating processed food, right?
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:09.360]   Like you just couldn't do it really.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.160]   Now you can.
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.780]   But the problem is it's not gonna work
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:15.900]   because you're gonna be still consuming too many calories
[02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:18.780]   because even though it's keto, what are they doing?
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:20.260]   Well, they're trying to make it more palatable.
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:22.100]   They're trying to make a better mouth feel,
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:24.200]   which I guess if you're being keto
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:25.820]   for the sake of being keto, great.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:29.980]   But if you have hopes of body composition modification,
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.880]   it's gonna really negatively impact.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:36.100]   So yes, I think minimizing the amount of processed food
[02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:38.260]   you consume can be important.
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:39.460]   Now that being said,
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.780]   it depends on the individual and their goals.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:44.500]   If your goal is to, for example, build muscle
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:47.420]   or maintain a high body weight for a sport, for example,
[02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:50.980]   like an NFL offensive lineman or something of that nature,
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:55.220]   or if you're, you know, I worked with an NBA team
[02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.900]   and they were kind of, I can't disclose anything,
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:00.300]   but they were looking at drafting a certain player.
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:05.360]   And, you know, like for them,
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:07.260]   processed foods may actually be a tool.
[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.480]   - Or teenagers.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.320]   - Right.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:12.240]   I think young people to eat more healthfully, I think,
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:13.280]   develop great habits,
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.560]   but some of them, their caloric needs are so high.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:16.380]   - So high.
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:18.000]   - That if they were eating what I eat,
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.800]   they're going to dissolve into, you know,
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.760]   they're just waste away.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:24.600]   - So I describe this again with a financial example,
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:25.960]   it's like a budget, right?
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.180]   So if I make a million dollars a year, for example,
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:34.480]   is it okay for me to buy like a $100,000 sports car?
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:36.600]   Let's assume that loans don't exist, right?
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:39.760]   Is it okay for me to buy a $100,000 sports car
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:43.920]   if I still am able to pay my mortgage and pay my utilities
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.880]   and like take care of my responsibilities,
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:47.720]   the things I should do?
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:49.120]   Is it okay if I do that?
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.680]   If it like makes me feel good and it's fun?
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:51.560]   - It's fine by me.
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:52.380]   - Yeah, it's fine, right?
[02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:54.480]   Like it fits in your budget.
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.100]   If I have, if I make, you know, 50 grand a year,
[02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:00.760]   should I be going out and, you know, buying a sports car?
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:02.360]   Probably not, because I'm not going to be able
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.320]   to pay my mortgage and all these other responsibilities.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.040]   So your protein, your fiber, your micronutrients,
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:09.880]   these are your responsibilities.
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.480]   But those become much easier to hit
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.100]   when you have higher calories, right?
[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:16.100]   So if you're, you know, eating 4,000 calories a day
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:17.700]   for whatever goal you have,
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:20.640]   you're probably gonna have some left over
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:24.540]   and like good luck eating 4,000 calories
[02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:26.720]   from mentally processed foods.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.200]   Quite frankly, you'll be miserable
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:30.840]   because you're gonna have such gut fill
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.880]   that you're gonna feel like you can't even move.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.320]   And so again, now it becomes, okay, well,
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.840]   is there something inherent to that food processing?
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.560]   Is there something, you know, that we can pick out
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:44.160]   that we know, okay, well, this is gonna be
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.620]   a negative effect on health,
[02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:47.960]   even like body composition stuff aside.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:51.020]   And I would say there's not really great evidence
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:52.200]   of that so far.
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:54.880]   And a great example of that is sugar.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.300]   I mean, I actually just wrote a really long article
[02:11:58.300 --> 02:12:00.720]   on my website about why I think sugar
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.080]   was not the root cause of the obesity epidemic.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:04.800]   And you kind of mentioned like sugar intake
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:07.160]   in the last 20 years has actually gone down a little bit.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:09.080]   - Alcohol intake.
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:10.960]   Well, if you look on the whole,
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.060]   it might've gone up a little bit,
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:14.980]   but you know, certainly in the male sector,
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:16.040]   it's gone way down.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:18.280]   Drinking used to be, there was a five o'clock,
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.040]   people were drinking all day.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.600]   People were smoking a lot less.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.560]   I think it's a real puzzle.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.320]   I'd love to know what your hypotheses are.
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.960]   - Well, smoking could actually be in opposition
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.840]   because nicotine's actually an appetite suppressant.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.400]   - Appetite suppressant also increases focus.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.840]   The problem is it often arrives in a delivery device
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:35.800]   that can kill you.
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.920]   But nicotine itself is a powerful agent.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.080]   It also can offset age-related cognitive decline,
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:45.780]   not entirely, but it makes the brain work better.
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:49.200]   - I've got a buddy who doesn't like caffeine
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.160]   and he just takes those nicotine pouches
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:53.380]   and like basically has one in almost all day
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:55.600]   because he has a very stressful job
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.160]   and is a high performer, you know.
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.820]   - Yeah, you have to be careful how you deliver it.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:01.860]   But there's a Nobel prize winning neuroscientist
[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:05.420]   that will chew five or six pieces of Nicorette an hour,
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:07.280]   which I do not recommend.
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:08.300]   But when he quit smoking,
[02:13:08.300 --> 02:13:10.280]   he just simply couldn't function as well.
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.060]   And he was the one who pointed me to the literature
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:15.120]   on offsetting age-related cognitive decline,
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.300]   even neuron maintenance.
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:18.120]   And it's pretty interesting.
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:21.080]   - Well, it's a pretty impressive nootropic, to be honest.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.480]   So now the first thing to realize
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.440]   is when we're talking about consumption data,
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.120]   this is based on actual production, basically.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:32.320]   They're assuming that, okay,
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.280]   we're producing this amount of these foods
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.440]   so we can assume the consumption is gonna follow that.
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.400]   So it's not a direct measurement,
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.400]   but it has been validated in a few different studies.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:44.200]   We know that oil consumption has gone up.
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:47.260]   Like that's, yeah, that's one of the big ones
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:50.080]   is, and this kind of forms the crux of like the seed oils
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:51.280]   or like the root of, you know.
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.340]   - It's definitely a question that I'm gonna ping you on.
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:55.460]   - They're gonna, you know, come into your house
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.840]   and kick your dog and, you know, punch your mom
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.860]   and all kinds of stuff, and I'm happy to address those.
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:06.180]   But so calories have still gone up.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:08.260]   There's some people who claim that they've gone,
[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:10.620]   they've kind of plateaued.
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:12.980]   I think the data seems to suggest
[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:15.500]   that calorie intake is still increasing.
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:18.460]   And the other thing to keep in mind is
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.900]   even if it's plateaued, it's still at a high enough level
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:23.900]   that obesity is probably gonna continue to increase
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.740]   up to a point where it'll probably plateau
[02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:26.820]   if calories are plateaued.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:28.700]   - What about energy output?
[02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:31.380]   Leaving aside meat, because that sounds highly individual.
[02:14:31.380 --> 02:14:33.780]   I mean, people are, the people we know
[02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:36.140]   are focusing on exercise, but there are a lot of folks
[02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:37.500]   out there that don't exercise.
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:40.820]   - And energy output has gone down over the years.
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:42.880]   I mean, it's very obvious when you look at
[02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:45.220]   how people work now compared to even, you know,
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.540]   30, 40 years ago, it's much different.
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:48.380]   - Less walking.
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:52.200]   Also, I learned recently that kids in high school
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.160]   don't take PE class in many schools.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:57.300]   We had to suit up and run and suit up.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:59.620]   And if you didn't bring your change of clothes
[02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:00.960]   or you didn't wash them, in which case
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.000]   you'd be better off just not wearing them.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.760]   Nothing like the smell of a boy's locker room
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.340]   after a weekend, you know, you can still remember it.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:10.320]   And it's not pleasant, but you had to run
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.280]   and do your pushups with everybody else
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.880]   or play volleyball in your regular school day clothes.
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:19.640]   So that, my understanding is that physical education
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:23.200]   is not part of the basic education any longer.
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:24.280]   - Probably depends on the state,
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.160]   but I know many states have done away with it
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:27.400]   just because of budget cuts.
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.800]   - So activity's going down, caloric intake is going up,
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.480]   maybe plateauing a little bit.
[02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:35.760]   Is that sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic?
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.360]   - Based on what I've seen, I think it's pretty sufficient.
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.440]   - So it might not be that big of a mystery after all.
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.720]   - No, I don't think it's a big mystery.
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.720]   I think that people don't like the concept
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:51.480]   of energy balance and I think because they insert judgment
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:56.480]   into it, which is, okay, if you're gaining weight over time
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.400]   at a fundamental level, it means you are eating,
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:02.000]   you're consuming more energy than you're expending.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.060]   People insert the judgment, which is you're lazy,
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:10.120]   you're a sloth, you're whatever it is.
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:12.160]   And I think there's a lot of people out there
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.000]   who actually think that.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.440]   I actually remember talking to somebody who was like,
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:16.480]   well, I would never hire an obese person for a job
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.600]   because it's just obvious that they're lazy.
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:22.560]   And I just remember going, are you serious?
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:24.960]   Like, there are plenty of very, very smart,
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.320]   high-achieving people who are obese.
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:29.200]   Like, it's not, this is what happens
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.240]   when you just put people in buckets.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:33.440]   People are much more complicated than this.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:38.200]   Yes, there is some personal responsibility,
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:39.360]   but then when you look through the data
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:43.180]   and you take, there was a study done in obese women
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:44.720]   where they found that women who were obese
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:47.760]   were 50% more likely to have had some form
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:50.280]   of sexual assault trauma in their past, right?
[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:54.240]   We know that people from lower income areas
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:56.640]   are more prone to be obese.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:16:59.880]   There's several, like people who have a higher ACE score,
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:01.860]   I believe, which is kind of measures
[02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:03.600]   like traumatic childhood events.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.480]   I believe there was a study showing
[02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:06.800]   they're more likely to be obese.
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:11.800]   So there's, yes, it is an energy imbalance problem,
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:16.280]   but just saying eat less, move more,
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.880]   that's like telling broke people,
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.400]   well, just earn more money than you spend.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:25.280]   It's technically right, but it's very unhelpful, right?
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:28.200]   What is more helpful is to describe
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.160]   and implement the habits and behaviors
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.360]   that will allow them to achieve that, right?
[02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:35.840]   So I realize we kind of got off track a little bit,
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:38.880]   but circling back to sugar,
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:45.160]   circa 2005, I believe that sugar was fattening
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:47.920]   and bad for your health independent of any other variable.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:49.880]   So independent risk factor.
[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:51.880]   And again, I want to be very clear
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.800]   about what independent means.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.280]   Independent means independent of all of the variables,
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:01.560]   this thing is bad for your health and body composition.
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.980]   - So on its own, independent of whether or not,
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:06.960]   for instance, it increases hunger and appetite.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:09.220]   - Right, or caloric intake, right?
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:12.520]   I was at a graduate school mixer
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:14.440]   and one of the professors there was somebody
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.480]   who had done research on high fructose corn syrup
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.840]   and fructose specifically as well.
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:22.240]   And he was talking to another professor
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.520]   and he had done this study in rodents
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.840]   where he'd fed like, I think it was like 60 or 70%
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:30.280]   of their calories from fructose.
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.140]   And they saw some really weird things happen in the liver
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:35.240]   with the NOVA lipogenesis and all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:37.940]   And the other professor is saying to him,
[02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:39.940]   yeah, it's pretty obvious that high fructose corn syrup
[02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:41.380]   is fattening.
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:44.280]   And this professor who had done this research said,
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.860]   yeah, because people overeat.
[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:48.640]   And he's like, don't you think there's something
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:49.480]   inherent to it?
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:51.740]   And he said, no, I think it's just calories.
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:53.220]   People are eating too many calories.
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:56.060]   He's like, we did a proof of concept looking at,
[02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:59.220]   could we try eating 70% of your daily calories
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:01.240]   from fructose, you actually can't do it.
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:04.600]   High fructose corn syrup is only 55% fructose.
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.800]   So if you ate nothing but high fructose corn syrup,
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.360]   you would still not get to this level
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:11.600]   that they fed in this study.
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.480]   So that got me kind of questioning my beliefs about it.
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:16.640]   So then I went through and I said, OK,
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:18.640]   let's take out the epidemiology.
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.420]   Not that epidemiology is useless, but people who eat more sugar
[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.480]   are also likely to eat more calories.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:26.960]   So then I looked for the randomized control trials
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.640]   where they match calories and vary the amount of sugar.
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:34.320]   And it doesn't seem to make a difference, at least
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.000]   from fat loss or fat gain.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.120]   But what about health?
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:40.400]   So for instance, if somebody, and I know somebody like this
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:45.400]   who loves sweets, is thin, get some exercise, not a ton,
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.360]   but my concern is that a significant fraction
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:53.200]   of their calories are coming from these sugary foods
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.920]   and therefore they're not getting enough fiber,
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:57.720]   maybe protein, et cetera.
[02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:01.160]   - So let's look at epidemiology for a second
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:03.500]   then I'll address this more directly.
[02:20:03.500 --> 02:20:04.880]   When we look at epidemiology,
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:07.020]   people who eat higher amounts of sugar
[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:09.240]   tend to be more obese.
[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.720]   They tend to have worse biomarkers of health.
[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:16.560]   But people who eat fruit, a lot of fruit sugar,
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:18.660]   don't have those same associations.
[02:20:18.660 --> 02:20:19.580]   So why is that?
[02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:22.140]   Well, because fruit has fiber with it, right?
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:26.440]   So I started to kind of believe,
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:28.580]   based on the data I was looking at,
[02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:32.500]   that high sugar intake was not the problem per se.
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:34.680]   The problem was that high sugary foods
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.180]   typically are very low in fiber.
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:41.920]   But if you're getting enough fiber, is sugar a problem?
[02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:45.420]   So there was a classic study by Serwitt in 1997,
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:47.220]   I think it's still the best study to this day,
[02:20:47.220 --> 02:20:48.560]   looking at this, and I know those people say,
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:50.480]   well, it was done in 1997, it has no relevance.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:53.000]   You know, I know, if it's a good study, it's a good study.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.620]   - No, some studies are timeless.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.120]   In fact, they have greater relevance.
[02:20:56.120 --> 02:20:58.240]   - We're not gonna go back and undo the discovery of DNA
[02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:00.880]   'cause it was 60 years ago or whatever it is.
[02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:05.880]   So they looked at an 1100 calorie diet, so low calorie diet.
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:10.940]   One group was eating over 110 grams of sugar a day,
[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:12.460]   like sucrose.
[02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:15.080]   The other group was eating about 10 grams of sugar per day.
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:19.460]   Calories, protein, carbs, fats, all matched, right?
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:21.900]   And they provided all the meals to these participants.
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:24.940]   So very tightly controlled, and it was over six weeks.
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:27.400]   Both groups lost the exact same amount of body fat.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:29.400]   So it doesn't seem to matter for body composition
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.400]   in terms of like sugar per se.
[02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.620]   Then they also looked at some biomarkers of health,
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:37.160]   like blood lipids and blood sugar and some other things.
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:39.920]   Again, there was no real differences.
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:41.840]   The only difference was,
[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:44.680]   so all their biomarkers improved in both groups.
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:48.040]   The only real difference was a small difference in LDL.
[02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:49.920]   So the group eating low sugar
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:53.280]   had a better improvement slightly in LDL,
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:55.640]   but that's probably because they were eating more fiber.
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:58.600]   And we know fiber can bind to cholesterol
[02:21:58.600 --> 02:22:00.440]   and lower LDL cholesterol.
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:05.440]   So is, now I wanna caveat this.
[02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.080]   Sugar probably doesn't have any like
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:08.600]   positive health effects.
[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:09.700]   So there's that, right?
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:12.280]   And nutrition is an exchange.
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.200]   If you're eating one thing,
[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:15.520]   you're not eating another thing, right?
[02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:18.640]   So I, but what I would tell people is,
[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:23.140]   focus probably less on sugar, focus more on fiber.
[02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:28.140]   So if you're eating 30, 40, 50, 60 grams of fiber a day,
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:32.260]   but your sugar is, you know, 80, 90 grams,
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:34.140]   I would not be that worried about it,
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.340]   especially if you're controlling calories as well.
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:38.700]   You know, what I would be worried about
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:40.780]   is if you're eating, you know,
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:42.480]   just a decent amount of calories
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:46.020]   and not getting enough fiber in general, right?
[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:49.380]   And even in studies, there's a few meta-analyses out now
[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:53.300]   looking at isoenergetic exchange of different carbohydrates
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:54.780]   with sugar carbohydrates.
[02:22:54.780 --> 02:22:57.420]   So fructose and glucose and sucrose.
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:22:58.460]   Now, why is this important?
[02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:00.640]   Well, again, you know, if you're not equate,
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:01.860]   when I say isoenergetic,
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:04.580]   that means equal in energy, equal in calories.
[02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:08.140]   So basically when they exchange either sucrose
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:12.540]   or glucose or fructose for other forms of carbohydrate,
[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:16.020]   do they see differences in these markers of health,
[02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:21.020]   like HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, you know, blood lipids,
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:24.240]   and with rare exceptions,
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:27.220]   and I can't remember all the data points exactly,
[02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:29.580]   but the take home is,
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:31.780]   doesn't really seem to make a difference.
[02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:34.820]   Now, before anybody out there straw mans my argument,
[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:37.540]   I am not advocating for sugar consumption,
[02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:39.340]   but I think it's important for people
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:41.620]   to not create weird associations in their minds
[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:43.060]   because one of the things I've observed,
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:45.400]   especially in the fitness industry,
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:48.020]   is when people feel like they can't eat something,
[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:49.920]   like it's one thing if you say,
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.300]   I am choosing not to eat this just because I'm choosing to,
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:55.500]   but it's a very different thing
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:56.660]   when you're purposely restricting
[02:23:56.660 --> 02:23:59.260]   because you feel like something is bad.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:02.300]   And this, I mean, you know the human brain
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:05.540]   is in many ways amazing, in many ways really dumb.
[02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:09.780]   So when you purposely try to restrict something,
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:12.740]   what tends to happen is you're more prone to binge on it.
[02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:14.980]   So people who will try to,
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:17.600]   well, I'm never gonna eat, you know, sugar again,
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:19.860]   or I'm gonna try and limit sugar,
[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:22.100]   and this isn't the case for everybody,
[02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:26.340]   but they have actually shown now in studies,
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:29.760]   people who are purposely restricting a specific nutrient,
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.860]   they tend to crave more of that nutrient.
[02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:35.140]   And if they do get exposed to it,
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:36.100]   they're more likely to have
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:37.900]   what's called a disinhibition reflex,
[02:24:37.900 --> 02:24:40.300]   which is basically a binge response.
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:43.420]   Because the thinking goes, well, this is bad.
[02:24:43.420 --> 02:24:47.560]   And there's no context on dosage making the poison.
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:48.880]   This is just bad in general.
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:51.460]   So if I have it, I've already screwed up.
[02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:54.060]   I might as well just have as much as I want.
[02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:57.260]   And I like Spencer Nadolski's comparison to this.
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:24:58.940]   That's like getting a flat
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:00.820]   and then going out and slashing your other three tires
[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.740]   because you might as well.
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:05.740]   So I really, I try to come from that perspective
[02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:09.020]   of I've seen so many people struggle with,
[02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:12.580]   maybe not an eating disorder, but disordered eating patterns
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:14.720]   because of these kind of associations
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:16.100]   they've made in their mind.
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:19.100]   And so that's why I'm so pedantic and a stickler
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:21.060]   about saying, okay, yes, it's a good idea
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:23.780]   to eat a mentally processed food
[02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:26.200]   and try to avoid processed foods.
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:30.100]   But not because processed foods are bad per se,
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:32.860]   but what the outcome tends to be
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:34.540]   from a lot of processed food consumption,
[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:35.860]   which is over consuming calories,
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.560]   and then therefore energy toxicity
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:40.440]   negatively contributing to your health.
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:42.940]   - Yeah, it seems like it, again, returns to this,
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:46.520]   the potential for a positive, negative,
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:49.500]   or neutral behavioral change and perceptual change
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:53.020]   of like craving a food all the time that you can't have
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:56.260]   is terrible, it's a terrible state to be in.
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:58.780]   And this, I think, is a perfect segue
[02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:01.880]   for something that first brought us together,
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:06.820]   which was this thing about artificial sweeteners.
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:11.240]   And let me just, for the record, be very clear,
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:14.880]   I have long ingested foods with artificial sweeteners.
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.660]   So I, throughout graduate school,
[02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:19.100]   I didn't have the best habits,
[02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:21.220]   they're healthier now than they were back then,
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:23.820]   but I would drink a Diet Coke or two per day.
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:25.940]   I still have the occasional Diet Coke.
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:30.780]   I'm not completely averse to drink something
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:32.340]   that has artificial sweetener.
[02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:35.500]   Although I do avoid sucralose for reasons
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.740]   that maybe I can get into a little bit later.
[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:41.840]   But a lot of the things I consume contain stevia,
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.840]   which is not artificial plant,
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:45.980]   but it is a plant-based non-caloric sweetener,
[02:26:45.980 --> 02:26:47.780]   low-caloric sweetener.
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:50.340]   And I don't have a problem with that.
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:52.660]   I became very interested in artificial sweeteners
[02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:55.100]   because of the animal data,
[02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:56.940]   I'm pointing to the idea
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:26:59.540]   that they may disrupt the gut microbiome.
[02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:01.340]   And then disrupt the gut microbiome,
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:03.260]   as you pointed out, is a very broad statement.
[02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:05.980]   We don't really know the percentage of lactobacillus,
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:07.900]   exobacillus, or whatever bacillus,
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:10.540]   whatever silice, illus in there,
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:13.820]   they all seem to end in illus, is ideal.
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.340]   And in fact, a lot of these companies
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:17.860]   that are having people send in their stool samples
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.300]   for analysis of the microbiome,
[02:27:19.300 --> 02:27:20.940]   I mean, take note,
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:23.700]   we don't really know what a healthy microbiome looks like,
[02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:26.140]   but we know what an unhealthy microbiome might look like.
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:29.020]   And it's one that doesn't have a lot of diversity in there.
[02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:30.340]   So I was interested in that.
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:32.020]   Then there's the recent human study,
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:33.980]   which we should definitely get into.
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.820]   But I was mostly interested in artificial sweeteners
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:41.820]   for the reason that there is this food conditioning effect.
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:43.840]   And you see it in animals and you see it in humans
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:47.820]   that if you ingest, well, coffee's a really good example.
[02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.580]   Coffee doesn't actually taste good, folks,
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:50.420]   even though I like it.
[02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:52.300]   But when you taste coffee for the first time,
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:54.620]   most people think it's bitter and disgusting.
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:57.020]   Most everybody, like 95% of people will say,
[02:27:57.020 --> 02:27:57.860]   this doesn't taste good.
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:59.020]   - Wine, beer, same thing.
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:01.140]   - Yep, but people learn to associate the state
[02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:03.400]   of being caffeinated, which most people like,
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.640]   in order to just feel normal, right?
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:07.020]   Caffeine's one of the few drugs we ingest
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:12.020]   just to feel ourselves enough that soon,
[02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:14.520]   myself included, really look forward to
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:16.340]   and enjoy a cup of coffee.
[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:18.980]   So it's a powerful example, in my opinion,
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:20.540]   of the food conditioning effect.
[02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:21.740]   So it's like a Pavlovian thing,
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:23.740]   instead of salivating, you crave, right?
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:28.440]   And it did seem that this study from Dana Small's lab,
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:31.340]   which admittedly was a small, no pun intended, study itself,
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:32.600]   not very many subjects,
[02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:34.440]   showed that if you ingested artificial sweeteners
[02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.820]   along with food that contained glucose,
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:38.520]   that you could sort of maybe even get
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.180]   a heightened glucose response
[02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:43.280]   just from the artificial sweeteners after a while.
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:46.180]   You and I connected over this study on social media.
[02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:49.760]   You pointed out that the design of the study wasn't superb.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:52.560]   There was co-consumption of glucose,
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:53.580]   which made it complicated.
[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:54.740]   We can go into that.
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:56.980]   But the reason I'm spouting off all this context
[02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:59.160]   is artificial sweeteners are many things.
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:02.380]   So I'd like to talk about their effects on blood sugar
[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:03.780]   in the acute sense,
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:06.660]   and according to what we might ingest them with,
[02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.880]   and how they might be changing blood sugar regulation
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:11.460]   at the level of brain and/or body.
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:13.700]   And then the gut microbiome data, I think,
[02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:16.260]   are interesting enough to discuss.
[02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:19.460]   And I have changed my view on artificial sweeteners
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:21.000]   based on what you've taught me.
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.780]   So this is a case where I've completely changed my view,
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:28.300]   which is that now I don't have any problem with them
[02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:30.140]   whatsoever based on the current data,
[02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:33.320]   which is not to say that I'm gulping down
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:34.960]   a cup fulls of sucralose,
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:40.740]   but I feel okay ingesting some stevia and some aspartame,
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.180]   and I'm not too worried about it.
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:46.700]   Yeah, so I think, kind of stepping back from a broad view,
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:51.860]   we have to think about, again,
[02:29:51.860 --> 02:29:53.260]   the hierarchy of importance, right?
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:55.900]   And what are you replacing with, right?
[02:29:55.900 --> 02:30:00.680]   So there is no situation where it is not a net positive
[02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:03.060]   to take somebody who drinks sugar-sweetened beverages
[02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:05.340]   and have them drink an artificially sweetened beverage.
[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:07.460]   Like in the meta-analysis,
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:09.860]   there was actually a recent network meta-analysis
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:12.660]   looking at markers of adiposity,
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:16.660]   HbA1c, a bunch of different health markers,
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:18.460]   and when you substitute,
[02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:21.700]   we'll call it non-nutritive sweeteners,
[02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:24.260]   since stevia is not artificial,
[02:30:24.260 --> 02:30:26.620]   so when you substitute NNS
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:29.200]   for the sugar-sweetened beverages,
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:32.860]   you see improvements in a lot of different things, okay?
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:35.460]   What was really interesting about this network meta-analysis
[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:38.220]   was they also looked at water substitution
[02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:40.380]   in place of sugar-sweetened beverages,
[02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:42.820]   and the effect wasn't as powerful as,
[02:30:42.820 --> 02:30:44.340]   and these are randomized control trials.
[02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:47.060]   - So artificial sweetener-containing beverages
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.300]   are more beneficial?
[02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:52.980]   - Were better for adiposity, for improving adiposity,
[02:30:52.980 --> 02:30:55.660]   and then in the health markers, it was kind of a wash.
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:31:00.660]   Water and non-nutritive sweetener beverages
[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:03.580]   performed similar,
[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:04.420]   but they were better than
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.980]   sugar-sweetened beverages, obviously.
[02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:11.980]   So they then, based on a network meta-analysis,
[02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:16.060]   is kind of where you can compare two things
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:17.500]   that didn't get compared directly.
[02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:18.700]   So there's not many studies
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:21.480]   comparing NNS versus water directly,
[02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:23.380]   but if you have a common comparator,
[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:26.260]   so if you compare A to B, and B gets compared to C,
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:29.180]   you compare A to C, based on how they interacted with B.
[02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:30.900]   I'm butchering it a little bit,
[02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:33.940]   but that's kind of the crux of a network meta-analysis.
[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:38.440]   So they looked at NNS versus water,
[02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:42.180]   and found that actually NNS was slightly better
[02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:43.860]   for improving adiposity.
[02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:46.140]   - NNS, of course, being non-nutritive sweeteners.
[02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:47.220]   - Right. - Yeah.
[02:31:47.220 --> 02:31:51.060]   - So, now again, if you like drinking water,
[02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:54.900]   and I'm not trying to convince anybody to do that,
[02:31:54.900 --> 02:31:56.540]   what that seems to suggest
[02:31:56.540 --> 02:31:59.740]   is there is a little bit of an appetite suppressant effect
[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:01.260]   from these artificial sweeteners,
[02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:03.180]   or non-nutritive sweeteners.
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:05.200]   Now, this gets a little bit more complicated,
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:06.620]   because if these were people
[02:32:06.620 --> 02:32:08.100]   drinking sugar-sweetened beverages,
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:09.620]   maybe they've already developed a sweet taste,
[02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:11.980]   and trying to go to water is too much of a jump for them,
[02:32:11.980 --> 02:32:14.100]   and so going to having something like intermediate
[02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:15.320]   is a little bit better.
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:16.340]   There's a lot wrapped up in this,
[02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:18.140]   but these are the randomized control trials,
[02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:19.540]   which are a little bit more tightly controlled,
[02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:22.260]   which I tend to default to a little bit more
[02:32:22.260 --> 02:32:24.140]   than I do the epidemiology,
[02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:26.020]   which epidemiology is just so messy,
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:29.140]   because sure, non-nutritive sweetener consumption
[02:32:29.140 --> 02:32:31.260]   may be associated with different things,
[02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:33.980]   but there's also a whole 'nother set of lifestyle
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:36.180]   and habits that are tied up in that.
[02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:38.180]   So I tend to hang my head a little bit more
[02:32:38.180 --> 02:32:39.740]   on the randomized control trials.
[02:32:39.740 --> 02:32:42.580]   So understanding that, okay,
[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:45.260]   now, all things being equal,
[02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:48.540]   understanding that this is a tool
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.580]   that may help some people,
[02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:51.820]   and whenever I post about non-nutritive sweeteners
[02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:55.500]   in the comments, there's always one or two or three people
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:58.400]   who say, "All I did was cut out soda,
[02:32:58.400 --> 02:33:00.980]   "and I drank diet soda instead, and I lost 50 pounds,"
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:02.000]   or, "I lost 75 pounds.
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:02.840]   "I even had one per se.
[02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:03.680]   "I lost 100 pounds.
[02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:04.500]   "That's the only thing I did."
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:05.340]   - Wow.
[02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:06.780]   - I mean, that's a pretty massive lever to pull.
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:08.400]   If you consider somebody who might be having like,
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:10.940]   I mean, five or six cokes a day,
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.080]   I mean, that's, you know,
[02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:15.180]   we're talking a serious amount of calories.
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.940]   - And that also means that by replacing
[02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:19.960]   with artificial sweetener-containing beverages,
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:23.620]   they did not replace the soda with food.
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:24.460]   - Correct.
[02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:27.700]   So like, now let's talk about, right,
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:30.020]   this is where we can get into the microanalysis,
[02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:34.220]   but is that obese person who lost 100 pounds by doing that,
[02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:37.640]   do I really care about maybe a small alteration
[02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.080]   to their gut microbiome?
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:40.540]   No, because their gut microbiome
[02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:41.860]   is actually much more healthy now
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:45.900]   by them having lost all that excess adipose tissue.
[02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:50.540]   So again, the ranking of what I'm worried about, you know,
[02:33:50.540 --> 02:33:53.380]   can change depending on the specific situation.
[02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:56.060]   Now, let's take somebody like me who's lean
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:59.040]   and doesn't really have, you know,
[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:00.940]   any health problems that I'm aware of.
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:06.220]   What about artificial sweeteners for me?
[02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:09.160]   Well, for me, I kind of got using them
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:10.940]   because of bodybuilding contest prep,
[02:34:10.940 --> 02:34:13.100]   because it was about the only appetite suppressant
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.160]   that worked for me.
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:20.200]   But do I think that they are healthful?
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:21.240]   Probably not.
[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:23.600]   Do I think they're unhealthy?
[02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:26.900]   I would say based on the current data,
[02:34:26.900 --> 02:34:29.380]   I don't think that they're unhealthy.
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:33.380]   Now, the information on blood glucose,
[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:35.880]   so there's some of the problems
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:38.700]   with some of these meta-analyses or these reviews
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:40.260]   is they kind of lump all
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:42.700]   the non-nutritive sweeteners together.
[02:34:42.700 --> 02:34:44.900]   And then they may say, well, there's no effect on this,
[02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:45.740]   or there's an effect on this.
[02:34:45.740 --> 02:34:47.780]   Well, the problem is, is these probably are,
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:48.780]   these are different molecules
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:50.660]   and they can interact differently.
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:53.400]   Aspartame very clearly seems to have no effect
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.600]   on blood sugar or insulin.
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:57.920]   That has been repeatedly shown.
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:02.720]   Stevia doesn't appear to have much effect.
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:05.900]   Saccharin and sucralose, the jury is kind of mixed.
[02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:08.960]   Now, there was the study that we first connected on,
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:11.620]   which I think their primary outcome measure
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:13.340]   was actually they were looking at like kind of
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:16.600]   the sweet taste, like how it affected sweet taste.
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.920]   So what they did was the group that was getting
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:25.140]   the sucralose was also paired with maltodextrin.
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:28.280]   The control group was getting sucrose,
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:33.280]   which is an appropriate way to compare the sweet taste
[02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:36.360]   because maltodextrin is not as sweet as sucrose.
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:39.320]   So when you're trying to combine sucralose,
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:41.640]   which is already sweet, with another form of carbohydrate,
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:45.100]   you'd want something less sweet compared to your control.
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:50.100]   But for the outcome measure of insulin and blood glucose,
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:54.540]   probably not as appropriate because we know maltodextrin
[02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:58.680]   has a much higher glycemic index than sucrose.
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:02.400]   - So they appropriately controlled for taste,
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:04.700]   but not for the effect of the sweeteners.
[02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:07.420]   And I think that that was a key component.
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:10.800]   And I think, yeah, the part of that study that intrigued me
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:13.920]   actually was in a talk version of that
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:16.980]   because that study drove me to watch a talk that,
[02:36:16.980 --> 02:36:19.520]   and we'll get Dana Small on the podcast at some point,
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:22.800]   hopefully, was that they had kids do this study
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:24.240]   and they actually had to cease the study
[02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:26.300]   because a couple of the kids became pre-diabetic.
[02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:29.560]   I mean, it seemed like there was something hazardous about,
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:31.400]   this was at Yale School of Medicine, it's a good place.
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:34.720]   I mean, you know, there's a range everywhere,
[02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:38.580]   but it just seemed like there's something about sweet taste
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.720]   that if taken to the extreme,
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:43.600]   might be able to impact blood sugar too.
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:48.600]   This has impacted my sort of behavior in the,
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:52.800]   I try to avoid really sweet things
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:54.560]   unless they're exceptionally delicious
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:56.080]   or the occasion calls for them,
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:58.420]   because I do think that it increases my craving
[02:36:58.420 --> 02:36:59.740]   for sweet things.
[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:02.420]   - Well, it might not be necessarily a craving,
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:06.120]   but it just programs you, so let's,
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:08.540]   your taste buds are extremely adaptable.
[02:37:08.540 --> 02:37:12.600]   So take, for example, like Indian food.
[02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:15.560]   If you bring like Indian people over to America
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:16.880]   and have them eat some of our food,
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:19.240]   they think it tastes extremely bland
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:22.300]   because they are used to such spicy food
[02:37:22.300 --> 02:37:24.060]   that unless they have a certain level of spice,
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:25.840]   they hardly even taste it.
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:27.660]   If you've ever done a high sodium diet
[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:32.020]   and then gone to a low sodium diet, it feels very bland.
[02:37:32.020 --> 02:37:33.060]   - That's a styrofoam.
[02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:36.860]   - But you're, over time, your taste buds adjust.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:38.020]   So sweet is the same thing.
[02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:40.420]   If you're used to eating a lot of sweet,
[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:42.020]   you get kind of desensitized to it.
[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.460]   And then if you go to something less sweet,
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:47.900]   it can kind of taste bland at first.
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:49.720]   Over time, it'll get better.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.600]   But, so I think it's one of those things that,
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.560]   again, it depends on the situation, right?
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:56.940]   Like if somebody's obese and they said,
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:59.100]   well, this is gonna help me, you know,
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:01.200]   eliminate sugar-sweetened beverage,
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:03.060]   like why would you wanna take that tool away from them?
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.960]   Like that's a great lever to pull.
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.080]   I mean, if somebody can lose literally 100 pounds
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:10.120]   from just one change in lifestyle
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:12.720]   that's not even really that inconvenient of a change,
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:16.180]   that's, that is powerful.
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:19.280]   But, again, is it the most healthy thing they could do?
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:22.080]   And I think that's kind of like what tends to get asked.
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.260]   We don't know.
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:26.580]   Is it healthier than water?
[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:32.340]   Probably not, maybe as healthy as it, who knows?
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:37.340]   Now, the, but I really make all those caveats
[02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:40.060]   because you don't want to have people
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:43.300]   who could use this as a tool think,
[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:45.340]   well, no, I can't do this 'cause it's actually bad for me.
[02:38:45.340 --> 02:38:46.820]   - Right.
[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:49.480]   - If it helps you lose 50 pounds or 75 pounds
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:52.420]   or whatever it is, trust me, it's not bad for you, right?
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:55.140]   - Well, it does seem to increase these satiety signals.
[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:56.680]   What do you think about the microbiome effects
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:58.080]   in this recent study?
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:59.160]   'Cause the recent study, I think,
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:01.060]   had some nice features to it.
[02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:04.260]   And you've done a detailed description of the study.
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:05.100]   So for those that want that-
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:07.820]   - Is this two-week study or the two-week study?
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:09.760]   - Yeah, and we will provide a link.
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:12.440]   You did an excellent video on this on your YouTube channel
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:13.860]   that really parses each piece,
[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:16.660]   but they compared the various artificial sweeteners
[02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:19.800]   and looked at the glucose response,
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:22.360]   looked at microbiome, a number of different measures.
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:23.740]   What was your general takeaway?
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:25.180]   And this was in humans for the,
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:28.120]   for I think the first time looking at microbiome in humans
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:30.140]   due to artificial sweetener.
[02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:32.960]   - There are a few studies on the microbiome in humans
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:33.840]   with artificial sweeteners.
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:36.740]   The first two that came out showed pretty much no effect,
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:39.100]   but they were a little bit shorter in duration.
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:40.300]   They were like two to four weeks.
[02:39:40.300 --> 02:39:41.980]   And again, it depends on like what,
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:43.460]   what bacteria are getting measured, right?
[02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:46.820]   Like there's many different kinds of bacteria,
[02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:50.140]   so they could just be measuring one that didn't change.
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:52.020]   And then there was a 10-week study that came out
[02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:55.420]   that got a lot of press and they showed,
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:58.480]   I think it was sucralose, I think,
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:03.100]   they showed an effect of change on the gut microbiome.
[02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:06.540]   Now, what was interesting is when I went into
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:07.940]   the species that changed,
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:11.260]   the species that changed the most compared to control
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:14.620]   was a species called, I'm going to butcher the name,
[02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:16.980]   but it's like Blaudia cocoides, I think it's called.
[02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:20.220]   - I must say, for those that work on the microbiome,
[02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:22.340]   it's so difficult to pronounce any,
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:25.060]   you need a nomenclature committee and you need acronyms.
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:27.960]   I'm sorry, just do it enough already.
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.540]   You're killing us.
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:31.020]   - We'll call it BC, we'll call it BC.
[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:31.860]   - Thank you.
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:33.580]   We're going to start the nomenclature committee without you
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.220]   if you don't do it soon.
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:38.300]   - So they noticed that this went up
[02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:39.700]   by like three to fourfold.
[02:40:39.700 --> 02:40:41.900]   So I kind of went down the rabbit hole on this.
[02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:45.460]   So interestingly, that particular species of bacteria
[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:47.940]   is actually associated with lower adiposity,
[02:40:47.940 --> 02:40:51.780]   better insulin sensitivity, and people who are obese
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.580]   and children who are obese tend to have less of it.
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:56.140]   So I said, well, based on that study,
[02:40:56.140 --> 02:40:58.340]   you could actually argue that maybe sucralose
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:00.260]   actually improved the gut microbiome.
[02:41:00.260 --> 02:41:01.820]   Now, again, I'm not making that claim
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:05.300]   because we have a hard time understanding
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.640]   what a healthy microbiome looks like already.
[02:41:08.980 --> 02:41:12.860]   What this last study that came out, my biggest take home
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:16.900]   was I think it's safe to say
[02:41:16.900 --> 02:41:18.860]   that some of these non-nutritive sweeteners
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:21.260]   are not metabolically inert.
[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:23.140]   There are some effects.
[02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:26.620]   Now, are those effects good, bad, or neutral?
[02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:29.400]   I think has yet to be fully elucidated.
[02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:34.400]   Now, I focused more on the blood glucose responses
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.040]   in my analysis.
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.500]   So in that 10-week study, they did oral glucose
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:44.500]   tolerance tests, and their conclusion,
[02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:47.640]   I didn't really feel like fit their data,
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:49.800]   so their conclusion was that, and again,
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:54.800]   I think it was sucralose, that it elevated blood glucose.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:41:59.680]   And this is where statistics can get kind of tricky.
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:04.240]   So my take home was the area under the curve,
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.640]   the incremental area under the curve,
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:09.180]   which is looking at basically the entire glucose response,
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:11.020]   was not different between the control
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:12.440]   and the sucralose group.
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.420]   To me, that's the biggest take home.
[02:42:14.420 --> 02:42:17.180]   There was one time point at the end of the study
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:19.520]   in the sucralose group, the 30-minute time point,
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:23.480]   that was statistically significantly higher blood glucose
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:25.440]   than the control group.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:29.380]   It's kind of one of those things where I go,
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:30.840]   okay, it was one time point.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.620]   It's statistically significant, but even then,
[02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:36.580]   we've seen things be statistically significant
[02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:37.980]   that end up being data artifacts
[02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:39.540]   'cause they're not reproduced.
[02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:41.180]   So I'm not saying that's what's happening here,
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:43.640]   but again, the overall area under the curve
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:44.480]   was not different.
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:45.960]   So to me, that was the biggest take home.
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:48.420]   - And papers, we should probably mention,
[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:53.420]   are published because of effects, generally.
[02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:55.340]   Lack of effect, harder to publish.
[02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:58.140]   - Null hypothesis doesn't, it's actually really unfortunate
[02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:01.560]   because a null hypothesis is just as useful data
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:04.680]   as the non-null hypothesis, but you're right.
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:07.080]   There is a very strong publication bias
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:10.420]   towards showing an effect versus not.
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:13.320]   - Yeah, unless you can flip a field on its head entirely
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:16.140]   by showing something did not happen.
[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:18.580]   Typically, the positive result out
[02:43:18.580 --> 02:43:20.400]   does the negative result in,
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:22.900]   positive meaning you see a result.
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:24.560]   And then, of course, it's one study.
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:29.520]   And I think that, as you talked about earlier,
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.380]   the center of mass of data in a given field
[02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:35.900]   are probably the best basis for what we should do
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:38.980]   in terms of, and so I'm not changing my behavior
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:42.040]   around the intake of artificial sweeteners.
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.100]   I personally am still going to consume stevia
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:46.940]   and aspartame in relatively small amounts.
[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:50.240]   But now I'm thinking, well, okay,
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.480]   if something contains sucralose,
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:53.920]   I don't have to perhaps actively avoid it.
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.180]   Whereas before I was, I was actively avoiding it.
[02:43:56.180 --> 02:44:01.180]   So the new study I thought was very elegantly,
[02:44:01.180 --> 02:44:02.340]   very involved.
[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:04.300]   I mean, to be quite frank,
[02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:07.900]   some of the animal stuff they did was extremely impressive.
[02:44:07.900 --> 02:44:09.420]   So there was actually two arms to this study.
[02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:10.900]   One was a human arm, one was the animal arm.
[02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:13.140]   I focused much more on the human side of it.
[02:44:13.140 --> 02:44:16.900]   So basically, this was a two-week study.
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:19.320]   And the really unique aspect of this,
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.740]   which I think is both a strength and a weakness,
[02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:27.700]   they had almost 1400 people apply for this study
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:31.420]   and they only had 120, I think, that actually went into it
[02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:34.720]   because they did a very detailed food analysis
[02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:35.560]   of these folks.
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:36.380]   All of these people said
[02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:38.680]   that they avoided artificial sweeteners
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:40.300]   or didn't consume them.
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:41.680]   And I think people don't realize
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:43.900]   how ubiquitous sweeteners are.
[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:45.460]   - Prior to the study, these people were like,
[02:44:45.460 --> 02:44:46.820]   it was like jury selection.
[02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:48.660]   They'd never, it's like not ever hearing
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:50.300]   of the plaintiff and the defendant.
[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:51.980]   These are these mutant people
[02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:54.020]   who have never had an artificial sweetener.
[02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:58.060]   - Right, so the strength is now you don't have a lot
[02:44:58.060 --> 02:45:02.540]   of like preexisting effects that may be clouding
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:04.020]   what would actually happen when you add it in.
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:05.700]   Like, for example, if you have people
[02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:08.920]   who are already consuming artificial sweeteners
[02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:11.660]   and then you have them consume artificial sweeteners,
[02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:15.180]   the likelihood things are gonna change is pretty low, right?
[02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:16.880]   So I think that that's a strength.
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:20.340]   It's also a weakness and I wanna be really careful
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:22.960]   because I think people took my words a little bit too far,
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:24.540]   which means I probably didn't do a good job
[02:45:24.540 --> 02:45:25.780]   of being nuanced enough.
[02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:29.580]   There is the possibility for a placebo effect here.
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:33.140]   So to me, if somebody has gone through
[02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:37.140]   that much painstaking care to avoid artificial sweeteners,
[02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:38.860]   it's likely they have a preconceived notion
[02:45:38.860 --> 02:45:40.260]   that those are bad for you.
[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:42.340]   Like, because they're difficult to avoid.
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:44.780]   Yes, it's possible if they're eating
[02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:45.940]   a very minimally processed diet
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:47.460]   that they're just not exposed to them.
[02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:49.580]   And that's very true as well.
[02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:52.260]   But the other thing that the researchers acknowledged
[02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:55.340]   was they weren't able to blind the study.
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:57.220]   Because if you've never had an artificial sweetener before,
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:45:59.180]   you're only used to like regular sugar
[02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:01.620]   and you have an artificial sweetener, you know.
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:03.500]   - You taste it. - You know.
[02:46:03.500 --> 02:46:05.140]   It's still sweet, but it's not the same sweet.
[02:46:05.140 --> 02:46:06.600]   - Yeah, and there's an interesting effect there
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.060]   where a lot of people don't like the taste of aspartame
[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:11.500]   the first time.
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:14.940]   I actually quit drinking diet soda for a while,
[02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:16.880]   thinking I should, and then had one.
[02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:19.140]   It tasted really, I can only describe it
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:21.260]   as kind of artificial, chemical.
[02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:23.620]   And then pretty soon it tasted great again.
[02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:25.820]   And so there is some attenuation there
[02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:27.660]   and whether or not that's central,
[02:46:27.660 --> 02:46:30.140]   meaning within the brain or peripheral, I don't know,
[02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:32.380]   but very interesting.
[02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:35.940]   Well, I see you as playing a critical role
[02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:38.860]   in defining what is and what isn't,
[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:40.700]   what still needs to be determined
[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:43.300]   in terms of this landscape and the entire landscape
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:44.500]   really of nutrition.
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:46.420]   - And that study did change my opinion
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:49.060]   in terms of, okay, I think we can clearly say
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:52.380]   now that like these aren't neutral,
[02:46:52.380 --> 02:46:54.900]   or sorry, that they're not inert, right?
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:56.540]   Like that was the thought process before
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:46:58.740]   was well, they're not digested or whatnot,
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:47:00.700]   so they must be inert.
[02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:02.480]   That doesn't appear to be the case.
[02:47:02.480 --> 02:47:07.160]   But again, like when we look at the blood glucose data,
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:11.820]   there's, and I'm not saying this is what happened.
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:14.020]   I wanna be very clear, not saying this is what happened.
[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:17.460]   I'm saying it's possible this happened.
[02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:20.580]   And so this is why we need more studies to verify.
[02:47:20.580 --> 02:47:22.300]   If these people had a preconceived notion
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:24.420]   that artificial sweeteners were bad for them,
[02:47:24.420 --> 02:47:26.660]   it's possible knowing they're ingesting
[02:47:26.660 --> 02:47:28.400]   artificial sweeteners that they could have had
[02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.100]   a blood glucose response.
[02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:34.900]   Now, my pushback on my own point there would be,
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:36.320]   then we should have expected to see it
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:39.880]   in all the non-nutritive sweeteners, which they didn't.
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:41.580]   It was just in sucralose and saccharin.
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:42.980]   - Yeah, it was kind of a graded effect
[02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.500]   where sucralose and saccharin showed
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:46.400]   the most dramatic change.
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:47.600]   - Yep.
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:51.240]   - And Stevia and a few of the others did not.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:53.440]   - And the other issue I took with it,
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.640]   maybe it's a ticky tack thing,
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:47:58.980]   was their primary outcome measure was blood glucose,
[02:47:58.980 --> 02:48:00.940]   the oral glucose tolerance test.
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:02.000]   But they had people administer
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:03.700]   their own oral glucose tolerance test,
[02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:05.200]   which basically they gave them, they said,
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:06.400]   okay, drink this drink.
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:08.180]   And they were wearing continuous glucose monitors,
[02:48:08.180 --> 02:48:09.580]   which should have been fine.
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:14.020]   But again, to me, and I'm being ticky tacky,
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:17.040]   and again, I know all studies are limited by funding.
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:19.940]   So I think overall, this was a great study,
[02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:23.480]   but I would have liked to seen them, you know,
[02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:28.080]   monitor the oral glucose tolerance test to administer it.
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:29.540]   - Yeah, and what they did before or after.
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:30.380]   - Yeah.
[02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:31.720]   - You want to know that they didn't ingest this
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:32.560]   or didn't ingest that.
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:33.380]   - Right.
[02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:34.220]   - Yeah.
[02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:35.060]   - Those two things.
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:37.860]   But the other, one of the caveat is,
[02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:39.200]   it was a two week study, right?
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:40.460]   So we gotta be really careful
[02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:42.000]   how much we interpret in this,
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.220]   because it's also possible that this is a transient effect.
[02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:46.160]   Right?
[02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:47.600]   And maybe it goes away over time.
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:48.440]   We don't know.
[02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:53.000]   But again, I think it's, we can clearly say,
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.380]   it's not inert, right?
[02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:59.100]   Now, how much emphasis we put on that on a two week study,
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:03.820]   I still will say, okay,
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:08.300]   maybe if you're worried, don't consume sucralose, right?
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:12.700]   But if you're, you know, 100 pounds overweight,
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:15.960]   and you want to use some sucralose as a replacement
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.540]   to help you lose weight,
[02:49:17.540 --> 02:49:20.380]   I would say don't let this study deter you from doing that.
[02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:23.540]   Because the net effect is still gonna be more positive
[02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:26.100]   than you not losing the weight, right?
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:28.460]   So if it's a tool that helps you, fine.
[02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:30.940]   But I do hold open the idea that, well,
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:33.760]   there could be negative effects from it as well.
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:34.960]   But again, we're looking at like,
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:38.060]   what's the, what is the overall outcome, right?
[02:49:38.060 --> 02:49:40.100]   And then when I looked at,
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:42.440]   they examined like some of the different things
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.100]   that were increased with these different sweeteners.
[02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:48.100]   And again, this word gets messy
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:50.220]   because one of the things they saw was a big increase
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:52.820]   in butyrate production from the change
[02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:55.020]   in the gut microbiome, presumably.
[02:49:55.020 --> 02:49:56.020]   Well, as we discussed earlier,
[02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:58.780]   butyrate's actually associated with like positive outcomes
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:49:59.980]   in terms of insulin sensitivity,
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:02.320]   inflammation, and some other things.
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:05.000]   So I just, I want to be real cautious before people say,
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:06.220]   well, there's a change in the microbiome,
[02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:07.940]   it must be a bad change.
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:10.220]   We don't know, it's possible.
[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:12.060]   And again, if we have, you know,
[02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:14.180]   10 more studies come out and start to show this,
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:17.340]   then I will start to shift my personal opinion
[02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:18.840]   of artificial sweeteners.
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:21.160]   - So in anticipation of sitting down today,
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:25.700]   I did solicit for questions on social media.
[02:50:25.700 --> 02:50:30.220]   And one of the questions that got a lot of up votes,
[02:50:30.220 --> 02:50:32.140]   likes if you will,
[02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:34.960]   was one that I think raises interesting questions
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:36.840]   about short-term and long-term health.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:37.820]   And it's the following.
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.380]   I think it's a common scenario.
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:42.660]   A number of people want to know,
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:45.460]   what is the healthiest way to approach
[02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:47.620]   a kind of rapid weight loss?
[02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:49.040]   And here, what I think is happening
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:51.500]   is somebody has an event coming up,
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:55.500]   or they're just tired of being the weight they are,
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:58.020]   or carrying the amount of adipose tissue they are.
[02:50:58.020 --> 02:51:02.500]   And they wanted to know whether or not it is safe
[02:51:02.500 --> 02:51:06.220]   to, for instance, lose three pounds a week for a few weeks
[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:09.280]   in anticipation of a wedding or some other event.
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:12.080]   And whether or not straight caloric restriction
[02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:16.300]   and increasing activity is the best way to approach that.
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:18.120]   With the understanding that they may gain back
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:19.660]   a little afterwards, they might make,
[02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:22.740]   I think ideally they'd like to maintain it afterwards.
[02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:24.980]   But what do you think of that sort of approach?
[02:51:24.980 --> 02:51:29.380]   You know, cutting caloric intake in half, for instance,
[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:33.580]   and then doubling and also doubling your physical output.
[02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:37.540]   - So it's interesting because the,
[02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:39.660]   you might be surprised by what I'm gonna say,
[02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:42.220]   which is the research data actually tends to suggest
[02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:46.940]   that people who are obese, who lose a lot more weight early,
[02:51:46.940 --> 02:51:49.000]   are more likely to keep it off.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:52.100]   Which seems a little bit kind of contradictory, right?
[02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:54.620]   Like, well, that doesn't seem very sustainable.
[02:51:54.620 --> 02:51:56.780]   But again, you're weighing competing things.
[02:51:56.780 --> 02:51:58.180]   So there's sustainability aspect,
[02:51:58.180 --> 02:51:59.980]   but then there's also like buy-in
[02:51:59.980 --> 02:52:02.540]   is huge for sustainability, right?
[02:52:02.540 --> 02:52:05.220]   So for a lot of overweight or obese people,
[02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:08.980]   if they start a diet and they don't see something quickly,
[02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:11.700]   they kind of bail on it because it's not working.
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:14.320]   Whereas if they see some rapid results pretty quickly,
[02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:16.500]   they buy in even harder, right?
[02:52:16.500 --> 02:52:19.040]   And so I think the conversation,
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:22.620]   especially for if there's any coaches or trainers out there,
[02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:26.300]   is just presenting that as the,
[02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:28.140]   one of my favorite lines is there are no solutions,
[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:29.580]   there's only trade-offs.
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:31.180]   I think Thomas Sowell said that.
[02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:35.520]   So you're having a trade-off here.
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:41.260]   It is, yes, you're gonna lose fat faster.
[02:52:41.260 --> 02:52:43.620]   You might lose lean mass a little bit faster too,
[02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:44.980]   which can be a problem.
[02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:49.180]   But I will say the more adipose tissue you have,
[02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.080]   the more aggressively you can diet
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:53.300]   without negative consequences.
[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:55.580]   Somebody like me doing a really aggressive diet
[02:52:55.580 --> 02:52:57.660]   is not gonna be good for my lean mass.
[02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:00.380]   One, I have a higher lean mass than normal.
[02:53:00.380 --> 02:53:02.940]   Two, I have a lower body fat than normal.
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:05.500]   As your body fat goes down,
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:09.260]   the percentage of weight loss from lean mass goes up.
[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:12.740]   So people who are very obese,
[02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:15.740]   because they have so much adipose tissue to pull from,
[02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:17.340]   there's very little reason for the body
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:19.480]   to catabolize lean tissue.
[02:53:19.480 --> 02:53:23.700]   Now, that being said, if you go on a,
[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:25.560]   people misinterpret, they're like,
[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:28.980]   well, I got an in-body done or a DEXA done
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:31.740]   and I've lost two pounds of lean mass
[02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:34.140]   and they've lost 20 pounds overall.
[02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:38.780]   Well, keep in mind, adipose tissue itself is 13% lean mass.
[02:53:38.780 --> 02:53:41.400]   So there's actually protein component
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:43.820]   to the structural component of the adipose tissue
[02:53:43.820 --> 02:53:45.180]   and it does have some water.
[02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:49.320]   So it's about 87% lipid, but the other part is lean.
[02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:52.700]   So at minimum, you should expect a 13% reduction
[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:54.640]   in lean mass when you diet.
[02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:57.620]   And then when you consider you lose body water overall,
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:01.580]   which is registers as lean mass and you lose,
[02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:04.060]   your splanchnic tissues can shrink a little bit.
[02:54:04.060 --> 02:54:07.760]   So it's normal to lose, for the average person to lose
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:12.380]   like 25 or 30% of the weight that they lose from lean mass,
[02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:15.700]   but that doesn't mean skeletal muscle tissue.
[02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:18.380]   And again, the more adipose you have,
[02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:21.220]   the more aggressively you can approach the diet
[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:24.700]   without really negative long-term consequences
[02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:26.860]   to lean mass or your overall health.
[02:54:26.860 --> 02:54:30.000]   But balance that with, okay, if I'm gonna do this,
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.260]   I need to understand that I'm not gonna be dieting
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:33.740]   this way forever.
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:36.080]   I'm doing this to give myself a boost to the beginning
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:37.840]   and I have to be okay at some point
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:39.060]   with transitioning to something
[02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:40.900]   that's a little bit more sustainable.
[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:43.200]   - Based on what you just said,
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:47.520]   it reminds me of the satiety signal effect of exercise
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:49.980]   you mentioned earlier, that exercising can improve
[02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:54.100]   our sense of when we've had enough to eat.
[02:54:54.100 --> 02:54:56.860]   I just want to briefly mention that when Ali Krum
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:00.700]   was on the podcast, she mentioned that they'd been doing
[02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:02.900]   a study that I have to pair you to
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:05.540]   and hear the conversation as a fly on the wall,
[02:55:05.540 --> 02:55:07.780]   because what she was telling me was that
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:12.060]   if people believe that a food is nutritious for them,
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:16.500]   then eating less of it registers as more satiating.
[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:20.540]   Whereas if people view dieting as a deprivation system,
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:24.320]   like, oh, you know, dieting is hard and the food sucks
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:25.360]   and it's terrible.
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.820]   Well, then they crave all sorts of other things.
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:30.620]   Whereas they actually observe in their studies
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:32.340]   where people report reduced craving,
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:33.780]   if they are told, for instance,
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.260]   a chicken breast and broccoli and some olive oil and rice
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:37.820]   is actually quite nourishing.
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.500]   It's actually really good for you.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:41.260]   Then people eat that and they feel
[02:55:41.260 --> 02:55:42.780]   like they've actually eaten more.
[02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:44.700]   The satiety signaling goes up.
[02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:46.820]   So it's just a point that Ali made,
[02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:47.660]   those aren't my data.
[02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:51.140]   - Satiety is so impressive because even the rate
[02:55:51.140 --> 02:55:55.300]   at which you eat and right down to the size of the plate
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:59.560]   and the color of the plate, like the contrast in color.
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:00.400]   - Really?
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.300]   - They see, I can't remember exactly.
[02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:07.300]   I think it's if the plate is a similar color to the food,
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:10.380]   I think people eat more.
[02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:13.520]   Whereas if it's a bigger contrast, they eat less.
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:16.220]   So even like plate color can make a difference
[02:56:16.220 --> 02:56:17.060]   on how much you eat.
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:18.940]   Again, human brain, very amazing,
[02:56:18.940 --> 02:56:20.900]   but also very dumb in some ways, right?
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:22.700]   - Not an optimized algorithm.
[02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:24.140]   - I always joke with people.
[02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:26.220]   I'm like, just look at how stupid humans are.
[02:56:26.220 --> 02:56:27.820]   You put some water in front of them,
[02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:29.500]   like the ocean, they're like,
[02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:31.500]   oh yeah, I'll pay 10 times more for this.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:35.080]   But it's just, we're kind of wired that way.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:39.540]   - The reward signaling pathways in the brain
[02:56:39.540 --> 02:56:42.940]   run one chemical mainly, dopamine.
[02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:46.420]   There are others, of course, and very few algorithms.
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:49.900]   It's sort of like a intermittent reinforcement
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:51.460]   is one random reinforcement,
[02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:53.340]   but in the end that there aren't many algorithms
[02:56:53.340 --> 02:56:54.700]   and we are probably not optimized,
[02:56:54.700 --> 02:56:56.180]   certainly not optimized for our own health
[02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:58.240]   because people will eat themselves to death,
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:00.060]   drug themselves to death, et cetera,
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:03.040]   simply because something felt good at one point.
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:04.260]   It proves your point.
[02:57:04.260 --> 02:57:06.060]   - One of the things I tell people,
[02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:09.680]   I said this on Andy Frisella's podcast was,
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:13.860]   interestingly, the dichotomy of life is
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:16.060]   if you do what's easy in the short term,
[02:57:16.060 --> 02:57:17.820]   your life will be hard.
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:19.700]   If you do what's hard in the short term,
[02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:21.100]   your life will get easier.
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:22.500]   It's very strange, and actually,
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:25.260]   Ethan Suplee had a great example of this.
[02:57:25.260 --> 02:57:27.240]   When he was over 500 pounds, he said,
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.420]   the amount of work I had to do to construct my life
[02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:35.780]   that I could just live was so much more work
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:39.780]   than just going to the gym for a couple hours a day.
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:41.780]   He's like, the gym work is hard.
[02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:44.860]   He's like, but when I look back how much work I had to do
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:48.560]   to sustain that lifestyle versus just going to the gym
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:52.160]   and restricting calories, he's like,
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:54.740]   to maintain the lifestyle of being 500 pounds
[02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:58.540]   was infinitely more difficult than what I do now.
[02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:02.180]   And so, again, a great example, short term, hard,
[02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:04.580]   going to the gym, calorie restriction,
[02:58:04.580 --> 02:58:07.000]   long term, life's easier.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.620]   Just really interesting dichotomy, I think, about a lot.
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:14.620]   - And it can't be restated often enough, seed oils.
[02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:17.580]   People want to ask about seed oils.
[02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:20.440]   And for those of you that are listening
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:23.540]   who are wondering why we're sort of chuckling already,
[02:58:23.540 --> 02:58:26.620]   I should mention that both in the Twitter sphere
[02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:28.460]   and Instagram and online,
[02:58:28.460 --> 02:58:30.880]   there are these very polarized views
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:33.080]   that probably aren't worth focusing on for too long,
[02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:35.340]   but there are a number of folks out there
[02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:38.900]   who are arguing that seed oils are the source of all,
[02:58:38.900 --> 02:58:42.700]   you know, the obesity epidemic, inflammation, et cetera.
[02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:44.580]   - Illuminating. - Everything.
[02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:48.180]   And then there are those that would argue just the opposite
[02:58:48.180 --> 02:58:50.700]   that, you know, meat is the source of all problems, et cetera.
[02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:54.220]   And I think we've, thanks to your nuance and expertise,
[02:58:54.220 --> 02:58:57.180]   we've hopefully appropriately framed things
[02:58:57.180 --> 02:58:58.900]   that it's never that black and white.
[02:58:58.900 --> 02:58:59.860]   It's simply not.
[02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:02.240]   - Rarely. - Rarely.
[02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:04.480]   I love olive oil.
[02:59:04.480 --> 02:59:06.060]   I realize that doesn't fit exactly
[02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:08.060]   into the seed oil category.
[02:59:08.060 --> 02:59:09.300]   I love olive oil.
[02:59:09.300 --> 02:59:10.900]   I use it in moderation.
[02:59:10.900 --> 02:59:14.680]   I do also consume some butter in moderation, et cetera.
[02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:17.540]   But are there any data on seed oils?
[02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:20.220]   And here, a good example I think would be like canola oil,
[02:59:20.220 --> 02:59:21.860]   which comes from the rape seed
[02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:24.360]   that literally was renamed canola oil
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:27.420]   because rape seed oil is not good marketing.
[02:59:27.420 --> 02:59:28.960]   - No, no, exactly.
[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:35.620]   So the first thing I'll say is seed oils
[02:59:35.620 --> 02:59:38.300]   have negatively contributed to our overall health
[02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:43.060]   because people in the last, you know, 20, 30 years,
[02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:46.420]   what they have tended to add into their diet
[02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:49.540]   that has increased the overall calorie load is oil,
[02:59:49.540 --> 02:59:52.400]   like these various, mostly from seed oils.
[02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:57.620]   But when we look at like one-to-one replacement
[02:59:57.620 --> 03:00:02.220]   with other fats, and so I, if you look at the epidemiology,
[03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:04.620]   yeah, you can find some epidemiology showing people
[03:00:04.620 --> 03:00:05.780]   who consume more seed oil
[03:00:05.780 --> 03:00:07.980]   have more negative health outcomes,
[03:00:07.980 --> 03:00:09.660]   problem is, again, tied up
[03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:12.260]   with a multitude of other behaviors.
[03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:15.020]   And then you can find mechanisms and the idea is,
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:18.620]   well, these have, they're polyunsaturated,
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:21.220]   which means in the fatty acid chain,
[03:00:21.220 --> 03:00:23.260]   there's multiple double bonds,
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:25.600]   which those double bonds can be oxidized
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:29.420]   when they're exposed to heat and some other things.
[03:00:29.420 --> 03:00:31.620]   And so the idea is, well, when you cook with these things
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:35.820]   and, you know, they may get oxidized
[03:00:35.820 --> 03:00:38.220]   and that's gonna cause inflammation in your body.
[03:00:38.220 --> 03:00:42.820]   So that's a plausible mechanism.
[03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:47.820]   So as always, I defer to the human randomized control trials.
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:52.220]   And so what you tend to find
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:56.060]   is when you substitute polyunsaturated fats,
[03:00:56.060 --> 03:00:57.920]   or sorry, when you substitute saturated fats
[03:00:57.920 --> 03:00:59.660]   for polyunsaturated fats,
[03:00:59.660 --> 03:01:04.000]   it's either neutral or positive in terms of the effects on,
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.180]   like inflammation is basically neutral.
[03:01:07.180 --> 03:01:09.980]   There's some studies that show a positive effect
[03:01:09.980 --> 03:01:12.280]   of doing polyunsaturated fats,
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:13.420]   but it probably depends
[03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:15.720]   on the individual polyunsaturated fat.
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:17.480]   And that's the other thing I don't really,
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:19.400]   is difficult because you're categorizing
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:20.960]   like everything in this one bucket
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:22.720]   and there are some differences
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:25.240]   between individual fatty acids.
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:27.840]   Even with saturated fat, like for example,
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:31.420]   stearic acid doesn't tend to raise LDL cholesterol,
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:34.100]   whereas, you know, saturated fat as a whole tends to raise
[03:01:34.100 --> 03:01:36.940]   LDL cholesterol, but there are some saturated fats
[03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:38.500]   that don't.
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:40.740]   So again, it's like we're putting things in buckets
[03:01:40.740 --> 03:01:43.060]   and it's a little more nuanced than that.
[03:01:43.060 --> 03:01:45.420]   Then if you look at like the effects
[03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:49.540]   of polyunsaturated fats
[03:01:49.540 --> 03:01:52.580]   on markers of cardiovascular disease,
[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:55.740]   again, tends to either be a neutral or positive effect
[03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:58.180]   when you substitute saturated fat
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:02:00.360]   for polyunsaturated fat.
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:02.220]   Now, if you want to get into like monounsaturated
[03:02:02.220 --> 03:02:05.700]   versus polyunsaturated, there's some,
[03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:07.780]   there's quite a bit of disagreement between the studies.
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:09.300]   What I would say,
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:11.860]   based on the human randomized control trials,
[03:02:11.860 --> 03:02:15.620]   is that you're probably better off consuming
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:17.660]   monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
[03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.720]   in place of saturated fat.
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:22.680]   But again, if the idea is, well,
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:24.580]   that means polyunsaturated are good for me,
[03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:26.620]   so I'm just gonna dump a bunch of oil on everything
[03:02:26.620 --> 03:02:28.060]   and now you're upping your calories,
[03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:30.020]   well, that's a negative now, right?
[03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:31.540]   Because you have to deal with the bigger problem
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:33.740]   of overall energy toxicity.
[03:02:33.740 --> 03:02:36.360]   So I'm not somebody who likes
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:38.180]   to demonize individual nutrients.
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:40.580]   I just haven't seen really compelling evidence
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:43.220]   that seed oils are the root cause
[03:02:43.220 --> 03:02:45.460]   of the problems that are being suggested.
[03:02:45.460 --> 03:02:49.040]   And I think this is a good example of kind of like,
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:50.960]   whenever there's something that pops up
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:52.300]   in the fitness industry,
[03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:54.700]   there's always like the opposite thing that pops up
[03:02:54.700 --> 03:02:58.380]   and it's like the reactionary, extreme reaction
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:00.860]   to whatever this thing was over here.
[03:03:00.860 --> 03:03:01.780]   And I think that's what we're seeing
[03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:03.260]   with some of the seed oil stuff,
[03:03:03.260 --> 03:03:06.980]   is it's mostly people who are trying to kind of
[03:03:06.980 --> 03:03:10.100]   expose the virtues of saturated fat.
[03:03:10.100 --> 03:03:14.180]   And listen, I think it's fine to consume some saturated fat,
[03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:19.180]   but again, I think limiting it to seven to 10%
[03:03:19.180 --> 03:03:22.900]   of your daily calorie intake is probably wise,
[03:03:22.900 --> 03:03:27.900]   again, based on all the consensus of the evidence
[03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:30.320]   I've seen.
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:32.620]   And so once again, like we're struggling with this,
[03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:35.480]   okay, we've got this epidemiology and these mechanisms
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:38.920]   that sound good, but then what actually happens
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:41.440]   when we do some human randomized control trials.
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:44.380]   And so far, I just haven't seen the evidence
[03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:49.380]   to suggest that seed oils are independently bad for you,
[03:03:49.380 --> 03:03:53.060]   independent of the calories they contain.
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:56.140]   - You said the words overall energy toxicity,
[03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:57.900]   and I just want to highlight that I think
[03:03:57.900 --> 03:03:59.580]   that's a fabulous term.
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:02.940]   I don't think enough people think about that
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:06.380]   because they are primed or we are all primed to think,
[03:04:06.380 --> 03:04:08.660]   okay, seed oils might be bad
[03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:10.300]   or artificial sweeteners might be bad,
[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:13.220]   or this particular component of blood work
[03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:15.220]   might represent something good or bad
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:19.140]   without taking into account overall energy toxicity,
[03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:23.700]   the toxicity of over-consuming calories, energy.
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:28.460]   And thank you for pointing out that most of the data
[03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:30.940]   point to the fact that saturated fat
[03:04:30.940 --> 03:04:34.220]   should make up about no more than 7% to 10%
[03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:36.240]   of total daily caloric intake.
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:40.380]   Is there a lower end threshold that can be problematic?
[03:04:40.380 --> 03:04:43.540]   For instance, I've noticed that my blood profiles,
[03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:45.860]   especially in terms of hormones,
[03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:49.160]   improve when I'm getting sufficient saturated fat.
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:51.600]   Maybe I'm a mutant, but years ago,
[03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:53.580]   because I'm a product of growing up in the '90s,
[03:04:53.580 --> 03:04:55.060]   I tried a low fat diet.
[03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:57.620]   It certainly crushed my androgen levels.
[03:04:57.620 --> 03:04:59.060]   I started adding some butter back in
[03:04:59.060 --> 03:05:02.140]   and I was right back in the sweet zone
[03:05:02.140 --> 03:05:03.580]   where I wanted to be.
[03:05:03.580 --> 03:05:07.500]   So, you know, 7% to 10% of daily caloric intake,
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:09.780]   I'm guessing is probably about what I do now.
[03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:11.020]   I'll have to check.
[03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:14.940]   But is there a danger to going too low in saturated fats?
[03:05:14.940 --> 03:05:17.900]   - So again, no solutions, only trade-offs, right?
[03:05:17.900 --> 03:05:20.180]   What maximizes out testosterone
[03:05:20.180 --> 03:05:22.460]   might not be the best thing for longevity, right?
[03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:23.820]   And vice versa.
[03:05:23.820 --> 03:05:25.860]   And I'm not making that claim specifically,
[03:05:25.860 --> 03:05:27.260]   but I think it's important to understand this,
[03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:28.580]   that I think we all have this idea
[03:05:28.580 --> 03:05:32.280]   that there's this one iconic diet out there
[03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:35.300]   that is going to be the best diet for building muscle
[03:05:35.300 --> 03:05:38.980]   and burning fat and preventing cancer and heart disease.
[03:05:38.980 --> 03:05:40.520]   And the reality is like,
[03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:43.460]   there's overall healthy dietary patterns that we see
[03:05:43.460 --> 03:05:45.460]   that are good for those things.
[03:05:45.460 --> 03:05:47.320]   But when we get down into the weeds,
[03:05:47.320 --> 03:05:50.320]   there's probably some push and pull here as well, right?
[03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:53.360]   So when it comes to saturated fat,
[03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:59.640]   there is some evidence that if you're too low on it,
[03:05:59.640 --> 03:06:02.060]   that yes, you can have a reduction in testosterone.
[03:06:02.060 --> 03:06:04.660]   Now, is that reduction in testosterone,
[03:06:04.660 --> 03:06:07.560]   let's say 15, 20%, whatever it may be,
[03:06:07.560 --> 03:06:10.420]   is that sufficient to actually cause loss of lean mass?
[03:06:10.420 --> 03:06:11.440]   That we don't know.
[03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:13.120]   That's never been shown.
[03:06:13.120 --> 03:06:15.400]   Interestingly, I just remembered this,
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:17.580]   there was one study that was comparing,
[03:06:18.580 --> 03:06:20.400]   (sighs)
[03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:23.760]   polyunsaturated fat versus saturated fat,
[03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:28.020]   and they equated total fat.
[03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:30.340]   And one of the really interesting things was
[03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:33.140]   the group getting the polyunsaturated fat
[03:06:33.140 --> 03:06:35.380]   had more lean mass at the end of the study
[03:06:35.380 --> 03:06:37.560]   compared to the group getting saturated fat.
[03:06:37.560 --> 03:06:39.740]   Now, it's only one study, I've never seen this replicated.
[03:06:39.740 --> 03:06:44.740]   So I'm very, this is a situation where I say,
[03:06:44.740 --> 03:06:47.120]   I would like to find out what the mechanism of that is,
[03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:48.880]   because this could just be random.
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:53.560]   But if that gets shown over and over,
[03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:55.900]   what I might say is, okay, well,
[03:06:55.900 --> 03:07:01.580]   if polyunsaturateds are somehow increasing lean mass
[03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:02.700]   compared to saturated fat,
[03:07:02.700 --> 03:07:04.340]   who cares what happens with testosterone,
[03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:06.180]   unless that reduction in testosterone
[03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:09.740]   is causing some kind of impotence for your life, right?
[03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:14.540]   So all that to say, I don't really know.
[03:07:14.540 --> 03:07:17.840]   And by the way, that's something for those watching
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:20.620]   and listening, real experts, every once in a while,
[03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:22.880]   you should hear them say the following words, I don't know.
[03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:25.780]   - Exactly, my graduate advisor was exceptional at that,
[03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:27.440]   and she was brilliant, right?
[03:07:27.440 --> 03:07:31.060]   - And then in terms of cholesterol synthesis,
[03:07:31.060 --> 03:07:34.580]   you really need a very, very small amount of saturated fat
[03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:36.380]   for LDL cholesterol synthesis.
[03:07:36.380 --> 03:07:38.140]   Your liver can synthesize.
[03:07:38.140 --> 03:07:41.560]   The amount of LDL cholesterol or cholesterol
[03:07:41.560 --> 03:07:44.020]   that your body requires is so small
[03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:46.700]   in terms of just living and being healthy.
[03:07:46.700 --> 03:07:49.940]   So I don't think you need to worry about that.
[03:07:49.940 --> 03:07:52.300]   And from a cardiovascular disease standpoint,
[03:07:52.300 --> 03:07:54.260]   there is some evidence that even taking people
[03:07:54.260 --> 03:07:57.820]   who have quote-unquote low LDL of 80 or 90
[03:07:57.820 --> 03:07:59.900]   and taking them down to 30 or 40,
[03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:03.480]   that there is still a benefit
[03:08:03.480 --> 03:08:05.820]   for the risk of cardiovascular disease.
[03:08:05.820 --> 03:08:08.980]   So again, you're weighing these two buckets, right?
[03:08:08.980 --> 03:08:12.460]   So what I say, if you're doing 7 to 10% from saturated fat,
[03:08:12.460 --> 03:08:13.660]   you're probably fine.
[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:17.540]   - I received a lot of questions about whether or not
[03:08:17.540 --> 03:08:21.460]   there are female-specific diet and exercise protocols.
[03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:23.940]   And I realize this is a vast landscape,
[03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:27.580]   but some of those questions related to menopause
[03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:30.380]   and premenopause, and some related to the menstrual cycle,
[03:08:30.380 --> 03:08:33.760]   most related to variations across the menstrual cycle.
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:37.540]   In terms of, let's just say,
[03:08:37.540 --> 03:08:40.400]   diet maintenance or sub-caloric diet,
[03:08:42.140 --> 03:08:44.820]   are there any things that you've observed?
[03:08:44.820 --> 03:08:48.180]   We'll talk a little bit later about this wonderful app
[03:08:48.180 --> 03:08:49.980]   that you've produced, this carbon app,
[03:08:49.980 --> 03:08:52.900]   which helps people manage their energy intake
[03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:54.500]   and a number of other things.
[03:08:54.500 --> 03:08:56.660]   And so there you have a sort of a database,
[03:08:56.660 --> 03:08:58.460]   or at least an experience base.
[03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:00.620]   And then I'm guessing there are probably also studies
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:02.820]   exploring male versus female differences
[03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:06.140]   in terms of adherence and what sorts of diets work.
[03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:07.280]   Are there any general themes
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:09.100]   that one can extract from that?
[03:09:09.100 --> 03:09:12.540]   - It's going to be a really unpopular segment for the women.
[03:09:12.540 --> 03:09:13.940]   Doesn't seem to make a big difference.
[03:09:13.940 --> 03:09:16.100]   - Well, actually they may be relieved to hear that
[03:09:16.100 --> 03:09:18.860]   because it would make sorting through the information space
[03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:20.380]   and certainly the information we've covered
[03:09:20.380 --> 03:09:22.140]   in this podcast up until now simpler.
[03:09:22.140 --> 03:09:24.260]   It means that everything isn't different for them.
[03:09:24.260 --> 03:09:29.260]   - Yeah, so if you look at the male versus female studies
[03:09:29.260 --> 03:09:32.720]   relation to diet, they seem to respond to some similar way,
[03:09:32.720 --> 03:09:35.060]   like similar calorie deficit
[03:09:35.060 --> 03:09:36.700]   seems to produce similar results.
[03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:41.300]   If you do low carb, high carb, regardless,
[03:09:41.300 --> 03:09:44.340]   it seems to boil down to the same principles.
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:46.940]   Now training wise, we do know that female,
[03:09:46.940 --> 03:09:49.040]   like the muscle fibers adapt a little bit differently
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:53.180]   to training, but without getting too far into the weeds,
[03:09:53.180 --> 03:09:55.580]   it doesn't really change the way you should train
[03:09:55.580 --> 03:09:58.400]   because for the most part building muscle,
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:00.840]   there's a lot of different ways to build muscle.
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:06.880]   So we know that like light loads up to maybe like 30 reps
[03:10:07.420 --> 03:10:09.860]   as long as it's taken close to failure
[03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:12.580]   have basically the same effect on building muscle,
[03:10:12.580 --> 03:10:17.400]   at least in the short term as heavy loads for low reps.
[03:10:17.400 --> 03:10:19.140]   It's mostly about taking the muscle
[03:10:19.140 --> 03:10:21.260]   close to fatigue or failure, right?
[03:10:21.260 --> 03:10:23.620]   You don't have to go to failure,
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:26.380]   but getting close within a few reps.
[03:10:26.380 --> 03:10:29.100]   If you're between one rep and 30 reps,
[03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:31.040]   if you're getting close to failure,
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:33.500]   seem to produce similar results.
[03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:36.540]   So again, great, you can pick with whichever form
[03:10:36.540 --> 03:10:38.900]   of discomfort you prefer, right?
[03:10:38.900 --> 03:10:43.440]   When it comes to female specific training,
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:46.380]   again, females actually,
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:48.140]   this is one thing that a lot of people don't know,
[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:52.660]   they actually put on a similar amount of lean mass
[03:10:52.660 --> 03:10:56.020]   as a percentage of their starting lean mass as men.
[03:10:56.020 --> 03:10:58.220]   In fact, there's no statistically significant difference
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:11:00.120]   in the amount of lean mass they put on.
[03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:02.660]   Now, the absolute amount of lean mass that's added
[03:11:02.660 --> 03:11:04.280]   will be greater for men because they started
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:06.000]   with a greater amount of lean mass.
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:07.940]   But the relative increase in lean mass
[03:11:07.940 --> 03:11:10.500]   is pretty much the same from similar training.
[03:11:10.500 --> 03:11:16.380]   Now, females, there's some differences in like fiber types.
[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:19.440]   Females tend to be a little bit less fatigable than men.
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:22.020]   They can go a little bit harder, a little bit longer.
[03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:23.580]   And there's also some evidence
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:25.660]   that they recover a little bit better.
[03:11:25.660 --> 03:11:30.160]   But that also could be simply due to the fact
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:34.080]   that they're not able to use as heavy of loads
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:36.780]   to induce hypertrophy.
[03:11:36.780 --> 03:11:40.180]   So I kind of have this theory that while,
[03:11:40.180 --> 03:11:43.300]   as a percentage of one rep max, you can program things,
[03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:44.980]   I think absolute load matters.
[03:11:44.980 --> 03:11:48.040]   When you look at like the most elite powerlifters,
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:49.640]   the super heavyweights aren't squatting
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:51.100]   three or four times a week
[03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:55.100]   because they're squatting eight, 900 pounds.
[03:11:55.100 --> 03:11:59.820]   I think that there's an overall recovery effect there.
[03:11:59.820 --> 03:12:01.180]   Again, I have no data to back this up.
[03:12:01.180 --> 03:12:03.560]   This is just my observation.
[03:12:03.560 --> 03:12:05.260]   But when you get into the lighter weight classes,
[03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:06.600]   and this goes for men too,
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:11.220]   you do see quite a few people who do many training sessions
[03:12:11.220 --> 03:12:14.980]   at high RPEs and seem to be able to recover from that.
[03:12:14.980 --> 03:12:17.740]   So I do think the absolute load makes a difference.
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:21.740]   Now, when it comes to like menstrual cycle,
[03:12:21.740 --> 03:12:25.220]   this is one of those things where I kind of tell people,
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:26.760]   do what you prefer.
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:28.720]   So there's some people who have said you should program,
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:30.620]   you should like kind of schedule your training
[03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:31.900]   around your menstrual cycle,
[03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:36.360]   which is whenever you're going through your menstrual cycle,
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:38.920]   reduce the intensity, reduce the volume
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:41.100]   because you're not gonna feel as good,
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:42.660]   you're not gonna train as well.
[03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:44.840]   What I would say is just auto-regulate that.
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:46.340]   If you go in and you're on your period,
[03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:49.640]   but you feel good and you're doing well that day,
[03:12:49.640 --> 03:12:51.740]   then I don't think you necessarily need to back it off.
[03:12:51.740 --> 03:12:55.500]   And there was one study that kind of supported that notion.
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:57.360]   But if you go in and you feel terrible
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:00.960]   and you feel like you could use a reduction
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:02.380]   in intensity and volume,
[03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:04.340]   then it's totally fine to auto-regulate that.
[03:13:04.340 --> 03:13:06.240]   And when I say auto-regulation,
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:09.300]   auto-regulation means you are regulating
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:13.140]   the individual training session based on your performance.
[03:13:13.140 --> 03:13:18.140]   So I auto-regulate in so far as like I'm a super nerd,
[03:13:18.140 --> 03:13:21.080]   so I have a velocity device,
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:23.220]   so I can actually attach to the bar
[03:13:23.220 --> 03:13:24.980]   and see how fast the load moves.
[03:13:24.980 --> 03:13:27.900]   And I know at various different like warmup weights,
[03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:29.860]   what velocities I should be hitting.
[03:13:29.860 --> 03:13:31.260]   So if I hit my last warmup
[03:13:31.260 --> 03:13:34.320]   and my velocity is about 10% higher than usual,
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:35.520]   I can be pretty confident
[03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:37.080]   that that's gonna be a good day for me.
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:39.820]   If it's lower, then I can back it off a little bit.
[03:13:39.820 --> 03:13:42.940]   In fact, at Worlds, when I hit my last deadlift,
[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:47.080]   it was 30%, my last deadlift warmup,
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:49.480]   it was 30% faster than I usually hit in the gym.
[03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:51.320]   And I turned and looked at my coach and I said,
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:53.700]   yeah, we're gonna get this today. (laughs)
[03:13:53.700 --> 03:13:55.820]   So there's various forms of ways to auto-regulate.
[03:13:55.820 --> 03:13:58.780]   But again, women, if you're on your period,
[03:13:58.780 --> 03:14:00.420]   but you feel good, I don't think there's any reason
[03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:01.700]   you need to back off.
[03:14:01.700 --> 03:14:03.180]   But if you're not feeling good,
[03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:05.860]   then it's totally appropriate to back off.
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:07.380]   - Raw versus cooked foods.
[03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:10.900]   People wanted to know whether or not, for instance,
[03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:13.840]   eating a raw apple versus, I don't know,
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:14.860]   does anyone cook apples?
[03:14:14.860 --> 03:14:16.340]   I guess people used to bake,
[03:14:16.340 --> 03:14:18.340]   they were baked apples was a dessert when I was a kid.
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:19.900]   It was kind of the letdown dessert.
[03:14:19.900 --> 03:14:20.740]   Sorry, mom.
[03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:21.740]   It was kind of like not awesome
[03:14:21.740 --> 03:14:23.540]   unless it had a scoop of ice cream in it.
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:25.740]   Even then, maybe not awesome.
[03:14:25.740 --> 03:14:27.560]   But anyway, raw versus cooked.
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:31.340]   Obviously, if you burn a piece of meat
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:33.740]   to the point where it's pure charcoal, that's too much.
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:37.380]   And if there is a small movement
[03:14:37.380 --> 03:14:39.000]   surrounding eating raw meats,
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.200]   that's not something I particularly enjoy.
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:44.760]   Frankly, sushi is the only raw food I personally ingest.
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:48.600]   And I am very careful about the sourcing, frankly.
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:49.800]   Reputable places.
[03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:53.120]   Is there anything real about this
[03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:56.060]   in terms of being able to extract the amino acids,
[03:14:56.060 --> 03:14:59.080]   vitamins, and minerals from the food raw versus cooked?
[03:14:59.080 --> 03:15:01.500]   - It just looks cool for Instagram.
[03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:05.200]   So when you cook foods, they actually tend to become,
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:06.840]   in terms of protein-containing foods,
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:09.820]   they tend to become more digestible, not less.
[03:15:09.820 --> 03:15:12.720]   Eggs are this way, meats are this way.
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:17.360]   People say, well, when you heat protein, you denature it.
[03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:19.380]   And I think they hear that word denature
[03:15:19.380 --> 03:15:20.700]   and they think destroy.
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:22.240]   And that is not what denature means.
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:25.940]   So proteins fold up into 3D dimensional structures.
[03:15:25.940 --> 03:15:28.920]   You know this, of course, based on their amino acid sequence
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:32.000]   and their specific energies of those amino acids.
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:35.360]   When you heat protein or add acid,
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:40.360]   it starts to unfold that protein structure.
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:43.840]   That happens during digestion anyway.
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.640]   So I always chuckle when I've seen some companies come out
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:48.880]   with way that you can cook with, right?
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:51.160]   That's not gonna destroy the amino acids.
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:54.220]   I'm like, so you mean like regular whey, right?
[03:15:54.220 --> 03:15:59.220]   So yeah, typically cooking actually makes amino acids
[03:15:59.220 --> 03:16:01.500]   more bioavailable, not less.
[03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:05.960]   Now I would stay away from charring your meat
[03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:09.040]   because there is some evidence that charring
[03:16:09.040 --> 03:16:11.600]   creates polyaromatic hydrocarbons,
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:15.040]   which at least in animals, when they give those,
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:16.480]   they appear to be carcinogenic.
[03:16:16.480 --> 03:16:18.700]   So if you do charring meat by accident,
[03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:20.820]   I would just cut off the charred portions
[03:16:20.820 --> 03:16:22.280]   and then you should be fine.
[03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:23.760]   - The char is delicious.
[03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:26.340]   Not if it's charred too much,
[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:28.460]   but there is something about a charred crust on a meat.
[03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:31.400]   My dad's Argentine and I have like a good char with you.
[03:16:31.400 --> 03:16:35.220]   What about, people referred to them in their questions
[03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:37.780]   as carb blockers, but I think what they're referring to
[03:16:37.780 --> 03:16:40.340]   are things like berberine and some of the glucose
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:43.220]   scavengers and one glucose scavenger I'd love for you
[03:16:43.220 --> 03:16:46.320]   to comment on is this assertion that taking a brisk walk
[03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:48.800]   after a meal, or maybe even a slow walk after a meal,
[03:16:48.800 --> 03:16:53.060]   some movement can help downshift the amount
[03:16:53.060 --> 03:16:54.920]   of circulating glucose in some way.
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:16:58.240]   I've heard that, not a lot of people,
[03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:00.860]   but some are starting to pay attention to this idea
[03:17:00.860 --> 03:17:03.620]   of taking things like berberine or even metformin
[03:17:03.620 --> 03:17:06.220]   can scavenge glucose.
[03:17:06.220 --> 03:17:08.160]   I personally can't take berberine.
[03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:09.700]   If I take it, I get massive headaches
[03:17:09.700 --> 03:17:12.460]   unless I've ingested tons of sugar and carbohydrates.
[03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:14.180]   So I just don't mess around with it.
[03:17:14.180 --> 03:17:16.180]   But I know there are a number of people out there
[03:17:16.180 --> 03:17:18.100]   that want to know whether or not
[03:17:18.100 --> 03:17:20.940]   these glucose scavengers can be useful.
[03:17:20.940 --> 03:17:22.780]   - I think that is really majoring in the minors.
[03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:25.420]   If I'm being honest, as far as like the carb blockers,
[03:17:25.420 --> 03:17:27.500]   there's like some white kidney bean extract
[03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:28.980]   and those sorts of things.
[03:17:28.980 --> 03:17:33.740]   They do block the digestion of carbohydrates, some.
[03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:38.740]   So when I say block, those watching or listening,
[03:17:38.740 --> 03:17:42.160]   metabolism is typically not on and off switches.
[03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:45.340]   Okay, so when we say things like block or attenuate
[03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:49.380]   or inhibit, typically we're not talking about
[03:17:49.380 --> 03:17:51.100]   just a switch on the wall that you press it
[03:17:51.100 --> 03:17:52.140]   and everything turns off.
[03:17:52.140 --> 03:17:54.380]   We're talking about a dimmer switch, okay?
[03:17:54.380 --> 03:17:56.880]   Like so you, it just changes the emphasis.
[03:17:56.880 --> 03:18:00.420]   But these carb blockers can reduce
[03:18:00.420 --> 03:18:01.840]   the absorption of carbohydrate.
[03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:05.740]   Now, they don't seem to cause weight loss
[03:18:05.740 --> 03:18:07.500]   when you just do it a normal diet.
[03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:08.660]   Now, why is that?
[03:18:08.660 --> 03:18:12.420]   Well, all it does is once those carbohydrates
[03:18:12.420 --> 03:18:15.580]   get to the large intestine and your bacteria
[03:18:15.580 --> 03:18:17.580]   get ahold of them, they start fermenting them
[03:18:17.580 --> 03:18:20.380]   to volatile fatty acids which get reabsorbed into your liver
[03:18:20.380 --> 03:18:22.060]   so you don't get the increase in blood glucose
[03:18:22.060 --> 03:18:24.220]   but you still get almost all the calories from it
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:26.140]   because it's just in a different form.
[03:18:26.140 --> 03:18:30.620]   So if carb blockers, if they actually worked really well,
[03:18:30.620 --> 03:18:33.840]   I mean, if you block something from being absorbed,
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:37.100]   your GI typically does not just let undigested materials
[03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:39.300]   sit in there, you get diarrhea.
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:41.380]   I mean, that would be the outcome.
[03:18:41.380 --> 03:18:43.980]   That's also how I like debunk the whole like 30 grams
[03:18:43.980 --> 03:18:46.860]   of protein at a meal, you can't absorb any more than that.
[03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:49.660]   I'm like, if that was the case, like when you ate a steak,
[03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:52.620]   like you would just start having diarrhea every time
[03:18:52.620 --> 03:18:54.700]   you went over that 30 gram threshold, right?
[03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:57.260]   - I remember during college, so this would be early '90s,
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:18:59.140]   there was the cholesterol craze,
[03:18:59.140 --> 03:19:03.640]   this idea of putting in non-digestible thing
[03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:07.700]   into things like potato chips so that it would clear through
[03:19:07.700 --> 03:19:11.620]   the GI tract faster, not absorb as many calories.
[03:19:11.620 --> 03:19:14.820]   It does raise, this went nowhere, obviously.
[03:19:14.820 --> 03:19:15.940]   You don't hear about this anymore
[03:19:15.940 --> 03:19:17.500]   but it does raise an interesting question
[03:19:17.500 --> 03:19:21.380]   related to energy balance, which is gastric emptying time.
[03:19:21.380 --> 03:19:25.940]   And obviously in the landscape of eating disorders
[03:19:25.940 --> 03:19:30.940]   in particular anorexia, use and abuse of laxatives
[03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:34.060]   is a way in which people will, in an unhealthy way,
[03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:35.620]   try and control their weight.
[03:19:35.620 --> 03:19:38.420]   And there's a lot of problems with that approach.
[03:19:38.420 --> 03:19:41.220]   But what about gastric emptying time?
[03:19:41.220 --> 03:19:46.100]   Is this one way that people could control
[03:19:46.100 --> 03:19:48.280]   their energy balance in a healthy way?
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:50.940]   And where does fiber come into play?
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:54.260]   - Fiber tends to improve GI transit time
[03:19:54.260 --> 03:19:55.140]   because it adds bulk.
[03:19:55.140 --> 03:20:00.140]   So your GI system is basically a tube
[03:20:00.140 --> 03:20:04.580]   and it has peristalsis, which is wave-like contractions
[03:20:04.580 --> 03:20:06.500]   that moves the food down through the tube.
[03:20:06.500 --> 03:20:08.660]   Well, if you have more bulk to the food, like with fiber,
[03:20:08.660 --> 03:20:10.480]   you can move it through a little bit better.
[03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:14.420]   Now in the gastric, the stomach specifically,
[03:20:14.420 --> 03:20:19.380]   fiber tends to delay gastric emptying and slow it a bit,
[03:20:19.380 --> 03:20:21.380]   probably 'cause it congeals a little bit.
[03:20:21.380 --> 03:20:27.380]   Now, this kind of gets into the glycemic index argument.
[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:29.940]   Like if you do low GI foods,
[03:20:29.940 --> 03:20:33.480]   you'll have a slower release of glucose.
[03:20:33.480 --> 03:20:36.080]   It's a slower gastric emptying time.
[03:20:36.080 --> 03:20:38.180]   Does that affect energy balance?
[03:20:38.180 --> 03:20:40.820]   And so there are quite a few studies looking at low GI
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:42.380]   versus high GI foods.
[03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:45.020]   In the studies where they don't control calories,
[03:20:45.020 --> 03:20:47.700]   low GI tends to outperform high GI,
[03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:50.580]   but when they control calories, there's no difference.
[03:20:50.580 --> 03:20:54.900]   And so what I think that suggests is low GI foods
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:57.300]   just by their nature tend to be higher in fiber.
[03:20:57.300 --> 03:20:59.980]   And so I think it just kind of comes back to the fiber issue.
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:01.180]   - Got it.
[03:21:01.180 --> 03:21:03.860]   I'd like to ask you about supplements for a moment.
[03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:05.280]   It's an enormous landscape,
[03:21:05.280 --> 03:21:09.100]   but I believe there are a few things that you believe in,
[03:21:09.100 --> 03:21:12.100]   meaning they exist and there are decent data
[03:21:12.100 --> 03:21:15.460]   to support their use, maybe even some anecdotal data
[03:21:15.460 --> 03:21:16.820]   based on your own experience.
[03:21:16.820 --> 03:21:19.640]   As long as we highlight it as such, it could be interesting.
[03:21:19.640 --> 03:21:21.700]   I've heard you talk about two in particular,
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:23.340]   one that I'm very familiar with,
[03:21:23.340 --> 03:21:25.080]   which is creatine monohydrate.
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:27.500]   If you'd share your thoughts on that,
[03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:28.780]   not just for muscle building,
[03:21:28.780 --> 03:21:31.300]   but maybe any other purposes for it.
[03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:33.220]   And then the other one is one that, frankly,
[03:21:33.220 --> 03:21:34.780]   I'm learning more about all the time now
[03:21:34.780 --> 03:21:38.580]   thanks to your prompt, which is rhodolia rosea.
[03:21:38.580 --> 03:21:40.220]   I think I pronounced that correctly.
[03:21:40.220 --> 03:21:45.220]   And why that might be interesting or of use to people.
[03:21:45.220 --> 03:21:48.980]   - Yeah, so touching on creatine,
[03:21:48.980 --> 03:21:52.780]   it is the most tested, safe,
[03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:54.680]   and effective support supplement we have.
[03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:57.180]   I mean, it's just, there are thousands of studies
[03:21:57.180 --> 03:21:59.080]   on creatine monohydrate now.
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:01.440]   And I would say very clearly too,
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:04.140]   if you're using any other form of creatine,
[03:22:04.140 --> 03:22:06.180]   I think you're wasting your money.
[03:22:06.180 --> 03:22:10.460]   Creatine hydrochloride has some hype around it.
[03:22:10.460 --> 03:22:12.580]   Apparently, it's a little more soluble.
[03:22:12.580 --> 03:22:14.980]   The claim is that you need less,
[03:22:14.980 --> 03:22:16.700]   but there's only a couple studies on it,
[03:22:16.700 --> 03:22:18.380]   and it's more expensive.
[03:22:18.380 --> 03:22:21.220]   - And creatine monohydrate is not particularly expensive.
[03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:22.540]   I realize people have different budgets,
[03:22:22.540 --> 03:22:25.700]   but it doesn't land in the, it's not a budget breaker.
[03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:27.180]   - Yeah, it's gotten more expensive
[03:22:27.180 --> 03:22:29.560]   because of COVID and supply chain issues.
[03:22:29.560 --> 03:22:32.520]   Even there's forms of creatine that appear to be as good,
[03:22:32.520 --> 03:22:36.100]   like hydrochloride, but it's more expensive.
[03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:38.220]   And then things like creatine ethyl ester
[03:22:38.220 --> 03:22:41.260]   has been shown to be worse than creatine monohydrate.
[03:22:41.260 --> 03:22:44.700]   Buffered creatine is as good or worse,
[03:22:44.700 --> 03:22:47.020]   and it's much more expensive.
[03:22:47.020 --> 03:22:49.660]   So I tell people, just take creatine monohydrate.
[03:22:49.660 --> 03:22:50.780]   It is tried and true.
[03:22:50.780 --> 03:22:53.820]   It's been shown to saturate the muscle cells 100%
[03:22:53.820 --> 03:22:56.580]   with phosphocreatine, and that's what you want.
[03:22:56.580 --> 03:22:59.500]   So creatine works through a few different methodologies.
[03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:01.980]   One, through increasing phosphocreatine content,
[03:23:01.980 --> 03:23:04.660]   which helps improve exercise performance.
[03:23:04.660 --> 03:23:09.540]   It also appears to improve recovery,
[03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:13.120]   and it increases lean mass,
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:16.180]   a lot of which is through bringing water
[03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:17.700]   into the muscle cells.
[03:23:17.700 --> 03:23:20.820]   But that is, I mean, muscle cells are mostly water.
[03:23:20.820 --> 03:23:22.980]   So when people say, "Well, it's just water,"
[03:23:22.980 --> 03:23:25.000]   that's what muscle cells mostly are.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:30.460]   And it also increases strength and some other metrics.
[03:23:30.460 --> 03:23:33.440]   Now, it also has been shown in studies
[03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:36.380]   that people tend to get a decrease in body fat percentage.
[03:23:36.380 --> 03:23:37.220]   Now, that's probably
[03:23:37.220 --> 03:23:38.860]   because they're getting an increase in lean mass,
[03:23:38.860 --> 03:23:42.040]   and so the relative is a decrease in body fat percentage.
[03:23:42.040 --> 03:23:42.940]   But there are a few studies
[03:23:42.940 --> 03:23:45.100]   that show a decrease in fat mass as well.
[03:23:45.100 --> 03:23:46.600]   I don't think that creatine's a fat burner.
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:48.640]   I think that people are able to train harder,
[03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:49.740]   build more lean tissue,
[03:23:49.740 --> 03:23:53.040]   and so that's probably having an effect on fat mass.
[03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:54.420]   Then they've actually shown more recently
[03:23:54.420 --> 03:23:56.120]   some cognitive benefits to creatine,
[03:23:56.120 --> 03:23:58.620]   which I find really interesting as well.
[03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:00.240]   But the only knock on creatine
[03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:01.460]   that anybody's been able to come up with,
[03:24:01.460 --> 03:24:03.460]   'cause they've debunked the kidney stuff,
[03:24:03.460 --> 03:24:05.220]   they've debunked the liver stuff,
[03:24:05.220 --> 03:24:09.080]   there's no evidence that it harms healthy kidney or liver,
[03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:10.540]   is hair loss.
[03:24:10.540 --> 03:24:11.840]   So what about hair loss?
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:14.020]   'Cause there was one study in 2009
[03:24:14.020 --> 03:24:16.360]   that showed that creatine increased DHT.
[03:24:16.360 --> 03:24:20.060]   But they didn't really show an effect
[03:24:20.060 --> 03:24:22.140]   on any other sex hormone.
[03:24:22.140 --> 03:24:23.780]   So it's kind of strange.
[03:24:23.780 --> 03:24:25.740]   Like, you would think if there was an increase in DHT,
[03:24:25.740 --> 03:24:28.640]   there would be something else that changes as well.
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:31.680]   And it's only one study,
[03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:34.360]   and again, didn't directly measure hair loss,
[03:24:34.360 --> 03:24:37.020]   measured DHT, which we know is involved
[03:24:37.020 --> 03:24:39.400]   in the loss of the follicle.
[03:24:39.400 --> 03:24:42.980]   So what I would say is that I am not convinced.
[03:24:42.980 --> 03:24:45.880]   It's only one study, never been replicated to my knowledge,
[03:24:45.880 --> 03:24:48.320]   and it was looking at a mechanism rather than an outcome.
[03:24:48.320 --> 03:24:51.620]   So if you're somebody who's prone to hair loss
[03:24:51.620 --> 03:24:54.780]   and you wanna avoid creatine because of that, I understand.
[03:24:54.780 --> 03:24:55.620]   But for most people,
[03:24:55.620 --> 03:24:58.020]   I don't think it's something to worry about.
[03:24:58.020 --> 03:25:01.540]   - Do you emphasize the classic loading of creatine,
[03:25:01.540 --> 03:25:04.000]   taking it a bunch of times per day and then backing off,
[03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:06.100]   or just taking it consistently at the,
[03:25:06.100 --> 03:25:09.740]   I think five grams per day is kind of the typical dose
[03:25:09.740 --> 03:25:10.680]   that people take?
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:14.060]   - So again, no solutions, only trade-offs.
[03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:15.840]   You can load it and you will saturate
[03:25:15.840 --> 03:25:19.340]   your phosphocreatine stores faster,
[03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:21.260]   like usually within a week.
[03:25:21.260 --> 03:25:22.740]   If you just take five grams per day,
[03:25:22.740 --> 03:25:25.380]   it'll take two, three, four weeks,
[03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:27.820]   but you will get to the same place.
[03:25:27.820 --> 03:25:30.900]   And you're probably gonna have a much lower risk
[03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:32.780]   of GI issues.
[03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:36.400]   Some people, creatine can be a gut irritant.
[03:25:36.400 --> 03:25:37.760]   If it is for some folks,
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:40.020]   I would recommend splitting it into multiple doses.
[03:25:40.020 --> 03:25:43.280]   So maybe like multiple two, one or two gram doses per day.
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:45.900]   And definitely don't load it
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:48.100]   if you're somebody who has GI issues from it.
[03:25:48.100 --> 03:25:52.280]   As far as rhodiola rosea,
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:53.820]   the research is still in its infancy.
[03:25:53.820 --> 03:25:55.980]   I was just reading a new systematic review
[03:25:55.980 --> 03:25:58.260]   that kind of concluded that we need more high quality
[03:25:58.260 --> 03:26:01.560]   research, but the research that is out there
[03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:04.420]   seems to suggest that not only does it reduce
[03:26:04.420 --> 03:26:08.160]   physical fatigue, but it also reduces the perception
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:13.100]   of fatigue and may also enhance memory and cognition
[03:26:13.100 --> 03:26:14.020]   as well.
[03:26:14.020 --> 03:26:16.460]   And it's referred to as an adaptogen.
[03:26:16.460 --> 03:26:18.740]   So I really like it.
[03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:23.260]   My anecdotal experience is when I combine that with caffeine,
[03:26:23.260 --> 03:26:26.720]   it tends to kind of smooth out the effects of caffeine.
[03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:29.100]   It's a more pleasant experience.
[03:26:29.100 --> 03:26:32.100]   And there's also some evidence that if you're coming
[03:26:32.100 --> 03:26:37.100]   off caffeine, that it can reduce the negative side effects
[03:26:37.100 --> 03:26:38.500]   to caffeine withdrawal.
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:40.500]   Which by the way, I didn't really believe in that
[03:26:40.500 --> 03:26:43.260]   until I actually did a cold turkey.
[03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:46.020]   So before I meet, I will cut out caffeine for seven days
[03:26:46.020 --> 03:26:48.620]   because you can basically reset your caffeine tolerance
[03:26:48.620 --> 03:26:49.980]   in seven days.
[03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:52.660]   And like two days in, I mean, I'm groggy.
[03:26:52.660 --> 03:26:54.180]   I've got the headaches.
[03:26:54.180 --> 03:26:56.220]   Usually I'll get like body aches that come up
[03:26:56.220 --> 03:26:58.700]   because caffeine is actually a mild analgesic.
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:27:02.180]   And yeah, so it was very interesting to see.
[03:27:02.180 --> 03:27:03.320]   But I slept like a baby.
[03:27:03.320 --> 03:27:04.160]   I'll tell you that.
[03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:06.900]   - And then you took caffeine prior to your event.
[03:27:06.900 --> 03:27:07.720]   - To the meat, yeah.
[03:27:07.720 --> 03:27:09.580]   - So you really want the maximum punch from it.
[03:27:09.580 --> 03:27:10.460]   That's why you do that.
[03:27:10.460 --> 03:27:14.220]   - Yeah, and like I said, rhodiola tends to,
[03:27:14.220 --> 03:27:16.480]   it doesn't eliminate those negative effects,
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:18.480]   but it tends to dampen them a little bit.
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:19.960]   So I really like it.
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:22.380]   Again, would like to see more research on it.
[03:27:22.380 --> 03:27:24.060]   But there's a lot more stuff coming out.
[03:27:24.060 --> 03:27:25.820]   Like ashwagandha is another thing
[03:27:25.820 --> 03:27:27.240]   that looks pretty promising.
[03:27:27.240 --> 03:27:30.380]   Seems to increase testosterone modestly.
[03:27:30.380 --> 03:27:31.500]   - Interesting.
[03:27:31.500 --> 03:27:32.620]   - I don't think it's like,
[03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:34.340]   they've shown increases in lean mass.
[03:27:34.340 --> 03:27:37.480]   I don't think the increase in testosterone
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:39.160]   explains the increase in lean mass.
[03:27:39.160 --> 03:27:40.740]   It's just not a big enough increase.
[03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:42.380]   - Could it be the decrease in cortisol?
[03:27:42.380 --> 03:27:43.220]   People have talked about-
[03:27:43.220 --> 03:27:44.060]   - It's possible.
[03:27:44.060 --> 03:27:46.740]   It does decrease stress, stress hormones.
[03:27:46.740 --> 03:27:49.240]   It also has been shown to help with sleep.
[03:27:50.700 --> 03:27:52.420]   But I would like to see more research looking at
[03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:54.420]   mechanistically how it's increasing lean mass
[03:27:54.420 --> 03:27:57.000]   before I kind of say conclusively
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:58.940]   that this is the next creatinine.
[03:27:58.940 --> 03:28:00.360]   There's more research that needs to come out.
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:03.100]   And then there's some other things that have an effect.
[03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:06.960]   Citrulline malate, there was a new meta-analysis
[03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:10.440]   that showed that citrulline malate can reduce fatigue
[03:28:10.440 --> 03:28:13.100]   and increase, I think, time to fatigue.
[03:28:13.100 --> 03:28:14.620]   And it may actually have
[03:28:14.620 --> 03:28:16.860]   some small recovery benefits as well.
[03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:20.660]   Different forms of carnitine can actually have recovery
[03:28:20.660 --> 03:28:22.500]   benefits and actually interesting,
[03:28:22.500 --> 03:28:25.900]   I think it's carnitine tartrate actually has been shown,
[03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:27.580]   Volokh published a study that actually showed
[03:28:27.580 --> 03:28:30.100]   that increased androgen receptor density in muscle cells.
[03:28:30.100 --> 03:28:31.180]   - That's interesting.
[03:28:31.180 --> 03:28:34.220]   L-carnitine and its other forms are pretty,
[03:28:34.220 --> 03:28:36.540]   I think there's good evidence that they can improve
[03:28:36.540 --> 03:28:38.860]   sperm and egg health for people who are looking to conceive.
[03:28:38.860 --> 03:28:39.700]   - Interesting.
[03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:42.660]   - Yeah, there are surprising number of studies on this
[03:28:42.660 --> 03:28:47.300]   in humans, but yeah, androgen receptor density,
[03:28:47.300 --> 03:28:49.440]   and that's from oral L-carnitine.
[03:28:49.440 --> 03:28:50.300]   People are taking capsules,
[03:28:50.300 --> 03:28:52.660]   not injecting directly into muscle.
[03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:54.340]   - And then you've got things like, obviously,
[03:28:54.340 --> 03:28:57.420]   like the other most effective supplement out there
[03:28:57.420 --> 03:28:58.660]   is probably caffeine.
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:00.460]   I mean, like if you look at the research studies,
[03:29:00.460 --> 03:29:02.500]   caffeine produces very consistently
[03:29:02.500 --> 03:29:04.700]   improvements in performance.
[03:29:04.700 --> 03:29:05.540]   So that's another one.
[03:29:05.540 --> 03:29:06.900]   Some people don't like the effect of caffeine.
[03:29:06.900 --> 03:29:07.820]   That's okay, but-
[03:29:07.820 --> 03:29:09.780]   - I wouldn't know 'cause I'd never come off it.
[03:29:09.780 --> 03:29:11.780]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[03:29:11.780 --> 03:29:14.900]   Well, interestingly, they do show that the effect appears
[03:29:14.900 --> 03:29:19.140]   to be consistent, that even if you're a habitual caffeine
[03:29:19.140 --> 03:29:22.780]   user, you do still get a benefit every time you take it.
[03:29:22.780 --> 03:29:24.460]   Like you said, you're just used to it.
[03:29:24.460 --> 03:29:28.100]   So there's those things.
[03:29:28.100 --> 03:29:30.620]   Then you've got things like beta-alanine,
[03:29:30.620 --> 03:29:35.140]   which it's in our pre-workout.
[03:29:35.140 --> 03:29:39.780]   Probably not super helpful for most people
[03:29:39.780 --> 03:29:41.000]   for resistance training.
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:45.620]   It does seem to have some benefits for like high intensity.
[03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:48.140]   Like if you get out more than like 45 seconds
[03:29:48.140 --> 03:29:50.620]   or 60 seconds of like really hard training,
[03:29:50.620 --> 03:29:53.860]   it does appear to help with delaying fatigue for that.
[03:29:53.860 --> 03:29:58.220]   And then you've got things like betaine,
[03:29:58.220 --> 03:30:00.280]   or also called trimethylglycine,
[03:30:00.280 --> 03:30:03.940]   which there's some evidence it can improve lean mass.
[03:30:03.940 --> 03:30:08.940]   There's some evidence that it can improve power output.
[03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:10.480]   So there's a few things out there,
[03:30:10.480 --> 03:30:13.340]   but most of the stuff is not very good.
[03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:18.340]   So I think that those kinds of supplements, very useful.
[03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:22.340]   But again, I will never tell people they need supplements.
[03:30:22.340 --> 03:30:25.600]   Again, even something like creatine is gonna be
[03:30:25.600 --> 03:30:29.780]   a very small effect compared to like proper nutrition,
[03:30:29.780 --> 03:30:32.820]   recovery, and hard training.
[03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:36.820]   One of the things I was talking with Ben Bruno the other day
[03:30:36.820 --> 03:30:39.980]   and I said, some people will ask me like,
[03:30:39.980 --> 03:30:41.700]   "How does this person make progress
[03:30:41.700 --> 03:30:44.600]   "because their programming is not evidence-based?"
[03:30:44.600 --> 03:30:47.960]   Or, "This guy, his exercises are dumb."
[03:30:47.960 --> 03:30:50.480]   And I'll say, "Yeah, but they train really hard
[03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:51.840]   "for 20 years."
[03:30:51.840 --> 03:30:55.360]   Like one commonality you see between really successful
[03:30:55.360 --> 03:30:59.320]   athletes or bodybuilders is they train really hard.
[03:30:59.320 --> 03:31:01.820]   And one of the things I have observed is
[03:31:01.820 --> 03:31:04.120]   the more into the weeds people tend to get,
[03:31:04.120 --> 03:31:06.920]   and again, this is just my own anecdote and observation,
[03:31:06.920 --> 03:31:08.600]   the more in the weeds they tend to get,
[03:31:08.600 --> 03:31:11.040]   the less hard I see them train.
[03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:13.360]   And so one of the things I really liked
[03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:16.680]   that Mike Israel said, who's got a PhD
[03:31:16.680 --> 03:31:19.220]   and is a bodybuilder himself,
[03:31:19.220 --> 03:31:23.260]   he said, "You can't out-science hard training.
[03:31:23.260 --> 03:31:24.860]   "That if you're looking to build muscle
[03:31:24.860 --> 03:31:26.540]   "and you're looking to improve your body composition,
[03:31:26.540 --> 03:31:29.440]   "the main thing is just doing the work over time."
[03:31:29.440 --> 03:31:30.720]   - Consistency and the hard work.
[03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:33.300]   And I would add to that, and this is true,
[03:31:33.300 --> 03:31:37.720]   academic endeavors too, of course, I hope you'll agree.
[03:31:37.720 --> 03:31:38.720]   - Absolutely.
[03:31:38.720 --> 03:31:41.000]   - Which is that, yeah, you know,
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:42.560]   the other thing is given the mental side,
[03:31:42.560 --> 03:31:45.300]   earlier we were talking about how satiety signals
[03:31:45.300 --> 03:31:47.800]   in the brain and what you think about foods can be relevant,
[03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:51.320]   learning to really enjoy training hard
[03:31:51.320 --> 03:31:54.120]   in addition to learning to really enjoy eating well,
[03:31:54.120 --> 03:31:56.860]   not just for the effects that it has on body composition,
[03:31:56.860 --> 03:31:59.720]   composition, excuse me, those two, of course,
[03:31:59.720 --> 03:32:02.340]   but just learning to really enjoy the process
[03:32:02.340 --> 03:32:05.400]   of training hard and a really hard workout
[03:32:05.400 --> 03:32:08.240]   or a really hard paper that you have to sort through
[03:32:08.240 --> 03:32:11.160]   or really digging through a book that's challenging,
[03:32:11.160 --> 03:32:13.620]   learning to really enjoy that I think is,
[03:32:13.620 --> 03:32:15.080]   if there is a power tool out there,
[03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:16.540]   it's the psychological end.
[03:32:16.540 --> 03:32:20.360]   - And I think a lot of that is getting the confidence
[03:32:20.360 --> 03:32:23.960]   of doing something hard that there's a payoff at the end.
[03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:27.320]   You know, and a lot of people, I get asked a lot in my Q&As,
[03:32:27.320 --> 03:32:28.500]   "How do I get more confident?
[03:32:28.500 --> 03:32:30.320]   "How do I become more confident?"
[03:32:30.320 --> 03:32:32.600]   And I'll tell people, "You have to do.
[03:32:32.600 --> 03:32:34.180]   "There's no hack, you can't read about it.
[03:32:34.180 --> 03:32:35.200]   "You gotta get in the arena."
[03:32:35.200 --> 03:32:38.400]   And I don't mean like compete in sports necessarily,
[03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:41.640]   but like doing a PhD or doing something,
[03:32:41.640 --> 03:32:44.200]   just something hard where you're putting yourself out there
[03:32:44.200 --> 03:32:45.400]   and you're saying, "This is my goal
[03:32:45.400 --> 03:32:47.360]   "and I'm gonna go for it."
[03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:50.860]   You just learn so much by doing that about yourself.
[03:32:50.860 --> 03:32:53.740]   And so just what you said,
[03:32:53.740 --> 03:32:58.320]   I will reframe things in my mind when bad things happen
[03:32:58.320 --> 03:33:00.320]   from, it's not to say I never get stressed out,
[03:33:00.320 --> 03:33:03.120]   'cause I do, and it's not to say that I never get down,
[03:33:03.120 --> 03:33:04.900]   'cause I do, 'cause I'm a human,
[03:33:04.900 --> 03:33:06.400]   but when something bad happens,
[03:33:06.400 --> 03:33:07.840]   I should post about this in my story today,
[03:33:07.840 --> 03:33:09.340]   when something bad happens,
[03:33:09.340 --> 03:33:12.720]   very rarely anymore do I go, "Woe is me,
[03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:13.720]   "why did this happen to me?"
[03:33:13.720 --> 03:33:16.360]   Because you're in the universe,
[03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:18.320]   random bad things are gonna happen.
[03:33:18.320 --> 03:33:23.900]   So instead I say, you know, if I'm not dead,
[03:33:23.900 --> 03:33:27.360]   instead I say, "Well, what an exciting opportunity
[03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:29.520]   "to overcome an obstacle."
[03:33:29.520 --> 03:33:33.400]   And I bet, because in the experience of my life,
[03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:36.340]   the biggest lessons and the best things in my life
[03:33:36.340 --> 03:33:38.700]   have actually come out of the most challenging,
[03:33:38.700 --> 03:33:40.900]   worst things that have happened.
[03:33:40.900 --> 03:33:44.260]   And so again, I would never have been able
[03:33:44.260 --> 03:33:46.300]   to do these sorts of things
[03:33:46.300 --> 03:33:47.940]   if I hadn't taken up weightlifting,
[03:33:47.940 --> 03:33:51.840]   because weightlifting taught me so much about perseverance,
[03:33:51.840 --> 03:33:55.200]   delayed gratification, overcoming obstacles,
[03:33:55.200 --> 03:33:58.340]   and that's why I love it even to this day.
[03:33:58.340 --> 03:33:59.440]   And I'll still get butterflies
[03:33:59.440 --> 03:34:01.120]   when I go in for a squat session,
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:03.060]   even though I've been doing it for 23 years.
[03:34:03.060 --> 03:34:04.060]   - That's wonderful.
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:06.060]   Well, it's clear that you embrace hard things,
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:07.780]   and for people listening to this,
[03:34:07.780 --> 03:34:09.540]   obviously it doesn't have to be weightlifting, you know,
[03:34:09.540 --> 03:34:11.740]   picking hard things, learning an instrument,
[03:34:11.740 --> 03:34:16.740]   learning a language, challenge is an absolute builder.
[03:34:16.740 --> 03:34:20.000]   - And they've actually shown like those sorts of things,
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:22.020]   like when you challenge yourself and also mentally,
[03:34:22.020 --> 03:34:24.420]   that I think there was a new study that came out
[03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:26.740]   basically showing a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's
[03:34:26.740 --> 03:34:29.040]   and other age-related cognitive decline.
[03:34:29.040 --> 03:34:32.160]   I mean, basically like use it or lose it, right?
[03:34:32.160 --> 03:34:37.160]   - Yeah, the will, the desire and the will to persevere
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:40.820]   no doubt translates to this thing
[03:34:40.820 --> 03:34:42.860]   we call the will to live, right?
[03:34:42.860 --> 03:34:44.900]   It's related to the will to live.
[03:34:44.900 --> 03:34:48.900]   Well, I think that what you just said, you know,
[03:34:48.900 --> 03:34:51.700]   beautifully embodies what most people are aspiring to,
[03:34:51.700 --> 03:34:53.340]   which is to, I think most people
[03:34:53.340 --> 03:34:55.540]   actually want to do hard things.
[03:34:55.540 --> 03:34:58.380]   They don't just want to have the results.
[03:34:58.380 --> 03:35:01.660]   I think that most people deep down have some understanding
[03:35:01.660 --> 03:35:03.740]   that their reward system works that way.
[03:35:03.740 --> 03:35:05.480]   I must say this conversation for me
[03:35:05.480 --> 03:35:06.860]   has been tremendously rewarding.
[03:35:06.860 --> 03:35:08.700]   First of all, it allowed me to meet you in person
[03:35:08.700 --> 03:35:11.260]   for the first time, which I've really enjoyed.
[03:35:11.260 --> 03:35:13.960]   I'm certain this won't be our last interaction
[03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:16.680]   on this podcast and elsewhere.
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:20.400]   Also the amount of knowledge that you contain inside you
[03:35:20.400 --> 03:35:22.320]   is astonishing and-
[03:35:22.320 --> 03:35:23.680]   - There's a lot of stuff rattling around up there.
[03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:26.300]   - Well, and we all benefit because your ability
[03:35:26.300 --> 03:35:27.860]   to pull from the mechanistic side,
[03:35:27.860 --> 03:35:30.380]   again, I think not limited to,
[03:35:30.380 --> 03:35:32.560]   but related to your background in biochemistry,
[03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:36.340]   all the way through to the impact in humans,
[03:35:36.340 --> 03:35:37.900]   animal studies, being able to understand
[03:35:37.900 --> 03:35:39.560]   where those sit relative to one another.
[03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:42.100]   And then you're obviously a practitioner of,
[03:35:42.100 --> 03:35:45.780]   you practice what you preach and what you talk about
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:49.840]   pertains to men, to women, younger people, older people,
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:53.220]   people who are vegan, keto, carnivore,
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:55.900]   you really are able to net a tremendous number of ideas
[03:35:55.900 --> 03:35:58.640]   while staying really nuanced and data-driven.
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:01.780]   And so I just want to say for myself
[03:36:01.780 --> 03:36:03.160]   and on behalf of the listeners,
[03:36:03.160 --> 03:36:05.160]   really appreciate you coming in here today
[03:36:05.160 --> 03:36:06.980]   and sharing with us your knowledge.
[03:36:06.980 --> 03:36:09.660]   We will absolutely point people in the direction
[03:36:09.660 --> 03:36:12.060]   of where they can learn more about you.
[03:36:12.060 --> 03:36:15.820]   And one of the places that I definitely want to mention
[03:36:15.820 --> 03:36:20.220]   before we part, however, is this Carbon app.
[03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:21.460]   And I should just mention,
[03:36:21.460 --> 03:36:23.340]   this isn't a paid promotion or anything of that sort.
[03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:25.440]   Actually, one of our podcast team members
[03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:27.440]   has been using Carbon for a long time.
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:29.080]   This is an app that you devised,
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:31.540]   which allows people to navigate the exercise,
[03:36:31.540 --> 03:36:34.020]   nutrition, energy balance space for weight loss,
[03:36:34.020 --> 03:36:36.880]   muscle gain, fat loss, weight maintenance.
[03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:38.920]   I would just like to briefly ask you about that
[03:36:38.920 --> 03:36:40.120]   before we conclude.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:43.500]   Without necessarily telling us everything
[03:36:43.500 --> 03:36:45.220]   that's in the Carbon app, I'd love to know
[03:36:45.220 --> 03:36:47.700]   what are the major things that it does and is good for?
[03:36:47.700 --> 03:36:50.320]   And then what were some of the key things
[03:36:50.320 --> 03:36:52.360]   that you wanted to make sure were in there
[03:36:52.360 --> 03:36:53.380]   when you built it?
[03:36:53.380 --> 03:36:55.700]   Like what's the sort of logical backbone behind it?
[03:36:55.700 --> 03:36:58.080]   'Cause I think there are a lot of food counting,
[03:36:58.080 --> 03:37:01.120]   calorie counting, exercise apps out there.
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:03.920]   Everyone I've talked to that uses Carbon,
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:06.480]   including our mutual friend, Cigar and Getty,
[03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:09.380]   this member of my podcast, et cetera, raves about it.
[03:37:09.380 --> 03:37:13.100]   So what is Carbon and what does it do?
[03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:15.240]   And what was your mindset in building it?
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:17.840]   What did you really want to see there
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:20.100]   that you didn't see elsewhere?
[03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:21.380]   - So those listening may not know,
[03:37:21.380 --> 03:37:24.020]   but I really, I started online coaching people
[03:37:24.020 --> 03:37:26.500]   for nutrition back in 2005.
[03:37:26.500 --> 03:37:29.780]   And that was the vast majority of my business
[03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:32.640]   all the way up until like 2017.
[03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:34.580]   And I had a lot of success with that,
[03:37:34.580 --> 03:37:38.280]   whether it be just average folks looking to lose weight
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:42.060]   or build muscle and right up to elite level competitors
[03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:43.000]   in physique sport.
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:48.620]   So I kind of had this idea like,
[03:37:48.620 --> 03:37:50.080]   I don't want to say I had the idea,
[03:37:50.080 --> 03:37:52.140]   a few people had the idea.
[03:37:52.140 --> 03:37:56.580]   What if we could take what I do in coaching
[03:37:56.580 --> 03:37:59.460]   and try to automate as much of that as possible?
[03:37:59.460 --> 03:38:02.660]   'Cause by the time I was becoming a really popular coach,
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:04.140]   I mean, I was expensive.
[03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:06.360]   You were looking at like me charging,
[03:38:06.360 --> 03:38:07.340]   I got to the point where I was charging
[03:38:07.340 --> 03:38:09.340]   about $1,000 a month for coaching, right?
[03:38:09.340 --> 03:38:12.580]   And most people cannot afford that.
[03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:16.300]   And I would like to not just coach rich people,
[03:38:16.300 --> 03:38:17.380]   you know what I mean?
[03:38:17.380 --> 03:38:20.420]   I would like to be able to help other people.
[03:38:20.420 --> 03:38:22.960]   So the idea was to create an app
[03:38:22.960 --> 03:38:24.220]   that could do some of this stuff.
[03:38:24.220 --> 03:38:27.440]   Now there's always a place for human interaction,
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:29.540]   but for people who can't afford that,
[03:38:29.540 --> 03:38:31.740]   our app is basically 10 bucks a month.
[03:38:31.740 --> 03:38:36.480]   And basically what we wanted to do was set up an app where,
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:41.260]   think about if you went to an nutrition coach,
[03:38:41.260 --> 03:38:42.680]   what would they do?
[03:38:42.680 --> 03:38:45.900]   They would probably ask you some questions about your goals,
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:48.140]   take some anthropometrics,
[03:38:48.140 --> 03:38:51.540]   and then they would use like that maybe dietary preference.
[03:38:51.540 --> 03:38:52.700]   And they'd use that information
[03:38:52.700 --> 03:38:55.180]   to kind of formulate a baseline plan.
[03:38:55.180 --> 03:38:57.260]   That's what Carbon does.
[03:38:57.260 --> 03:38:59.100]   So we ask you, I think there's eight questions
[03:38:59.100 --> 03:39:04.060]   in the signup flow about like your activity, your exercise,
[03:39:04.060 --> 03:39:08.020]   your lifestyle, your body weight, your body fat percentage.
[03:39:08.020 --> 03:39:10.180]   And if you don't know it, we help you calculate it.
[03:39:10.180 --> 03:39:13.100]   It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.
[03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:14.740]   And then your dietary preferences.
[03:39:14.740 --> 03:39:17.900]   And we use that to come up with kind of your baseline
[03:39:17.900 --> 03:39:20.340]   and your baseline will be your calories, your protein,
[03:39:20.340 --> 03:39:22.220]   your carbohydrates and fats.
[03:39:22.220 --> 03:39:24.500]   And what's different about our app,
[03:39:24.500 --> 03:39:27.140]   'cause apps like MyFitnessPal or whatever
[03:39:27.140 --> 03:39:28.700]   will do that as well.
[03:39:28.700 --> 03:39:32.140]   What's different about ours is we encourage people
[03:39:32.140 --> 03:39:34.060]   to log their weight daily for the reasons
[03:39:34.060 --> 03:39:35.660]   that we talked about earlier.
[03:39:35.660 --> 03:39:38.100]   And then you can also track your food in the app.
[03:39:38.100 --> 03:39:39.820]   And honestly, I think our food tracker
[03:39:39.820 --> 03:39:43.060]   is actually way easier to use than most of them out there.
[03:39:43.060 --> 03:39:46.420]   What we typically get great rave reviews about
[03:39:46.420 --> 03:39:49.100]   is how user-friendly our interface is,
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:50.720]   that it makes intuitive sense.
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:55.700]   And so you track your food, try to hit these macros
[03:39:55.700 --> 03:40:00.700]   that you're prescribed and each week you will be prompted
[03:40:00.700 --> 03:40:03.500]   to check in with the coach on your check-in day.
[03:40:03.500 --> 03:40:06.020]   And then you put in some information
[03:40:06.020 --> 03:40:08.380]   and then based on how you're progressing,
[03:40:08.380 --> 03:40:12.460]   the app will adjust or not adjust
[03:40:12.460 --> 03:40:13.780]   based on how you're progressing.
[03:40:13.780 --> 03:40:16.980]   So for example, if you're hitting a weight loss plateau,
[03:40:16.980 --> 03:40:20.300]   it will sense that and it will reduce your calories
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:22.340]   or if you're trying to gain weight
[03:40:22.340 --> 03:40:25.460]   and you hit a plateau, it'll increase your calories.
[03:40:25.460 --> 03:40:28.260]   And there's a lot of backend algorithm stuff
[03:40:28.260 --> 03:40:30.300]   that takes care of this, but the fundamental crux
[03:40:30.300 --> 03:40:33.100]   of the app is we try to determine
[03:40:33.100 --> 03:40:34.660]   your total daily energy expenditure,
[03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:36.660]   because that's gonna tell us the first big thing
[03:40:36.660 --> 03:40:39.340]   we need to know, which is how many calories
[03:40:39.340 --> 03:40:41.880]   do you need to be eating for your goal, right?
[03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:46.880]   So on the front end, we basically do our best guess
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:50.700]   based on your anthropometrics.
[03:40:50.700 --> 03:40:53.340]   Not gonna be perfect, but it'll get us in the ballpark.
[03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:55.780]   And if you do know, like some people already know,
[03:40:55.780 --> 03:40:57.720]   well, I know what I maintain my body weight on.
[03:40:57.720 --> 03:40:59.920]   There's actually a spot where you can manually enter that
[03:40:59.920 --> 03:41:01.020]   during the signup flow.
[03:41:01.020 --> 03:41:03.820]   So that's helpful for people who are super nerds like me.
[03:41:03.820 --> 03:41:07.860]   But then if you're just, people will ask,
[03:41:07.860 --> 03:41:10.100]   well, do you take Apple Watch data?
[03:41:10.100 --> 03:41:11.280]   Do you take this, do you take that?
[03:41:11.280 --> 03:41:13.100]   And know, for the reasons we talked about,
[03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:15.060]   that it overestimates energy expenditure.
[03:41:15.060 --> 03:41:19.180]   What our app does is it's an algebra equation.
[03:41:19.180 --> 03:41:21.860]   If you, because your body weight,
[03:41:21.860 --> 03:41:23.820]   your maintenance calories,
[03:41:23.820 --> 03:41:25.620]   is your total daily energy expenditure.
[03:41:25.620 --> 03:41:27.660]   Your average calories that you eat
[03:41:27.660 --> 03:41:29.780]   to maintain your body weight will be the same
[03:41:29.780 --> 03:41:32.400]   as your total daily energy expenditure.
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:36.120]   So if we know how body weight is changing,
[03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:39.820]   and we know how many calories the person's consuming,
[03:41:39.820 --> 03:41:42.880]   we can actually solve for what energy expenditure is, right?
[03:41:42.880 --> 03:41:45.140]   And you can see in the app that we'll,
[03:41:45.140 --> 03:41:47.260]   there's a kind of a maintenance calorie tracker
[03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:48.940]   or energy expenditure tracker.
[03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:52.020]   And typically after about three to four weeks,
[03:41:52.020 --> 03:41:54.420]   even if the app was off at first,
[03:41:54.420 --> 03:41:56.600]   it will have you pretty darn close.
[03:41:56.600 --> 03:42:00.380]   Because like, let's say somebody comes on
[03:42:00.380 --> 03:42:04.020]   and their goal is to lose a pound and a half a week
[03:42:04.020 --> 03:42:05.340]   or something like that.
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:08.500]   And the first week they lose three pounds.
[03:42:08.500 --> 03:42:10.780]   Now, the app actually accounts for the fact
[03:42:10.780 --> 03:42:12.540]   that you can lose more water weight the first week,
[03:42:12.540 --> 03:42:14.660]   so they probably wouldn't get an adjustment.
[03:42:14.660 --> 03:42:17.260]   But let's say the next week they lose three pounds.
[03:42:17.260 --> 03:42:21.540]   The app will sense that and adjust their calories up
[03:42:21.540 --> 03:42:23.060]   because it will be estimating
[03:42:23.060 --> 03:42:26.540]   that their energy expenditures are actually higher
[03:42:26.540 --> 03:42:28.160]   than what it had previously estimated
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:30.100]   based on the amount of weight they're losing.
[03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:31.340]   And the same thing goes in reverse.
[03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:32.700]   If they're not losing the amount of weight
[03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:34.240]   that they're supposed to,
[03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:36.400]   it will lower them based on the fact
[03:42:36.400 --> 03:42:39.320]   that it may have overestimated their energy expenditure.
[03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:42.560]   But that's the first crux of it
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:44.840]   is tracking that energy expenditure.
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:48.240]   And then the next thing is protein.
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:52.120]   So when the backend algorithm stuff is happening,
[03:42:52.120 --> 03:42:54.840]   calories are set first based on your energy expenditure
[03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:55.660]   and your goal.
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:42:58.660]   So for example, if you're on an aggressive diet,
[03:42:58.660 --> 03:43:01.320]   your calories are gonna be lower
[03:43:01.320 --> 03:43:04.780]   even if your energy expenditure might be a little bit high.
[03:43:04.780 --> 03:43:06.460]   Just because if you're trying to lose two pounds a week,
[03:43:06.460 --> 03:43:07.300]   I mean, you're gonna be
[03:43:07.300 --> 03:43:09.700]   in a pretty aggressive calorie deficit.
[03:43:09.700 --> 03:43:11.520]   So it's gonna set the calories first.
[03:43:11.520 --> 03:43:14.220]   Then it will set protein based on your lean body mass.
[03:43:14.220 --> 03:43:17.780]   Then the calories that are left over
[03:43:17.780 --> 03:43:19.700]   will be allotted to carbohydrate and fat
[03:43:19.700 --> 03:43:21.340]   depending on your dietary preference.
[03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:23.060]   And we have a few different dietary preferences.
[03:43:23.060 --> 03:43:27.820]   There's balanced, which is about 50/50
[03:43:27.820 --> 03:43:31.480]   to 60/40 carbohydrate to fat of the remaining calories.
[03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:33.100]   Then you have low fat,
[03:43:33.100 --> 03:43:36.040]   which is obviously a higher ratio of carbohydrate.
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:38.000]   You have low carb.
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:40.800]   You have a ketogenic diet, which is very, very low carb.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:43.480]   And then there's also a plant-based option.
[03:43:43.480 --> 03:43:46.100]   And within each of those options,
[03:43:46.100 --> 03:43:48.960]   still you can go in and actually shimmy the macros
[03:43:48.960 --> 03:43:50.980]   a little bit within a certain range
[03:43:50.980 --> 03:43:53.040]   so that you can kind of dial in
[03:43:53.040 --> 03:43:54.960]   what your specific dietary preference is.
[03:43:54.960 --> 03:43:56.180]   Because again, if we go back
[03:43:56.180 --> 03:44:00.040]   to what is gonna produce the best long-term results,
[03:44:00.040 --> 03:44:02.340]   it's whatever the person can adhere to.
[03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:06.740]   So we really try to start with the concept of adherence
[03:44:06.740 --> 03:44:09.400]   by allowing people to have the dietary preference
[03:44:09.400 --> 03:44:10.860]   that they want.
[03:44:10.860 --> 03:44:13.540]   And there's some other apps out there that are good apps.
[03:44:13.540 --> 03:44:14.620]   For example, we get asked a lot,
[03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:15.640]   what's the Darren Trenar app
[03:44:15.640 --> 03:44:17.720]   and the Renaissance Periodization app.
[03:44:17.720 --> 03:44:19.620]   And they have a great app.
[03:44:19.620 --> 03:44:21.020]   But theirs is kind of more rigid.
[03:44:21.020 --> 03:44:23.060]   And it'll say, you're gonna eat this many meals
[03:44:23.060 --> 03:44:25.540]   and you're gonna have these foods at these times.
[03:44:25.540 --> 03:44:26.660]   So we're kind of the opposite.
[03:44:26.660 --> 03:44:28.660]   We wanna give you maximum flexibility.
[03:44:28.660 --> 03:44:29.500]   Now, for some people,
[03:44:29.500 --> 03:44:32.820]   they would prefer the rigid structure at first.
[03:44:32.820 --> 03:44:34.940]   But we find that for most people,
[03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:37.140]   giving them more flexibility
[03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:40.040]   typically improves adherence over the long run.
[03:44:40.040 --> 03:44:41.980]   So that's kind of how the app works.
[03:44:41.980 --> 03:44:44.180]   And again, like there's multiple different goals.
[03:44:44.180 --> 03:44:45.700]   It's not just a weight loss app.
[03:44:45.700 --> 03:44:49.200]   There's a maintenance, there's a muscle building.
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:51.160]   So you've got all kinds of different goals
[03:44:51.160 --> 03:44:52.620]   that can be accommodated,
[03:44:52.620 --> 03:44:54.820]   different rates of each of those goals.
[03:44:54.820 --> 03:44:59.500]   And I mean, I've used the app for over three years now
[03:44:59.500 --> 03:45:00.780]   to do my body weight.
[03:45:00.780 --> 03:45:03.880]   And I mean, like when I say that it's dialed me in,
[03:45:03.880 --> 03:45:06.240]   because I'm very regimented with, you know,
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:09.380]   logging and logging my weight.
[03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:12.840]   So what I targeted to weigh in at Worlds,
[03:45:12.840 --> 03:45:17.060]   I got down to the 0.1 kilogram.
[03:45:17.060 --> 03:45:21.300]   So it's pretty cool to be able to like use a tool
[03:45:21.300 --> 03:45:24.580]   that I helped develop to actually coach me.
[03:45:24.580 --> 03:45:26.780]   So it's a great tool.
[03:45:26.780 --> 03:45:28.620]   You know, we did some statistics.
[03:45:28.620 --> 03:45:30.740]   We polled 2,500 members.
[03:45:30.740 --> 03:45:32.900]   And one of the questions we asked is,
[03:45:32.900 --> 03:45:34.740]   "Would you recommend this to a friend?"
[03:45:34.740 --> 03:45:36.860]   And 91% said yes.
[03:45:36.860 --> 03:45:38.640]   So we, on our average,
[03:45:38.640 --> 03:45:40.860]   I think our average retention is like seven months,
[03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:43.420]   which for an app that costs $10 a month is really great.
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:44.340]   So. - That's great.
[03:45:44.340 --> 03:45:46.900]   Yeah, as I mentioned, a number of people I know use it.
[03:45:46.900 --> 03:45:48.460]   This is not a paid promotion.
[03:45:48.460 --> 03:45:52.100]   But I think people need guidance and tools.
[03:45:52.100 --> 03:45:53.940]   And what we know about the human brain
[03:45:53.940 --> 03:45:56.020]   is that winging it can work,
[03:45:56.020 --> 03:45:59.800]   but that the brain will cheat itself often.
[03:45:59.800 --> 03:46:01.880]   There's a Feynman quote about this and I'll get it wrong.
[03:46:01.880 --> 03:46:04.800]   And it's always bad to try and quote Feynman anyway,
[03:46:04.800 --> 03:46:06.140]   'cause he said it so much better,
[03:46:06.140 --> 03:46:08.380]   but that we are the easiest.
[03:46:08.380 --> 03:46:10.380]   You know, it's easy to fool ourselves, basically,
[03:46:10.380 --> 03:46:11.220]   is what he was saying.
[03:46:11.220 --> 03:46:13.220]   Easiest to fool ourselves. - Absolutely.
[03:46:13.220 --> 03:46:14.060]   - Sounds great.
[03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:17.300]   We will put a link to it so that people can check it out.
[03:46:17.300 --> 03:46:20.300]   Again, it sounds like a wonderful tool.
[03:46:20.300 --> 03:46:23.380]   And a tool that nets a lot of the principles
[03:46:23.380 --> 03:46:28.380]   that sit as major themes for weight loss, weight gain,
[03:46:28.380 --> 03:46:32.600]   I would assume directed lean muscle,
[03:46:32.600 --> 03:46:34.740]   lean tissue gain is what most people are after,
[03:46:34.740 --> 03:46:36.300]   and weight maintenance because a number of people
[03:46:36.300 --> 03:46:38.580]   would like to just maintain.
[03:46:38.580 --> 03:46:40.660]   Listen, I really appreciate your time
[03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:42.700]   and all that you're doing.
[03:46:42.700 --> 03:46:45.500]   Certainly your time and energy and knowledge today,
[03:46:45.500 --> 03:46:46.820]   but also what you're doing
[03:46:46.820 --> 03:46:48.820]   on the various social media channels.
[03:46:48.820 --> 03:46:53.100]   And just the fact that somebody from the depths of academia
[03:46:53.780 --> 03:46:55.660]   is out there sharing so much knowledge
[03:46:55.660 --> 03:46:57.660]   across so many domains.
[03:46:57.660 --> 03:47:01.340]   You're a gem in this landscape of nutrition
[03:47:01.340 --> 03:47:04.780]   and one that people really need to hear from.
[03:47:04.780 --> 03:47:07.100]   So thank you so much for your time.
[03:47:07.100 --> 03:47:08.820]   - Thank you, I appreciate the opportunity.
[03:47:08.820 --> 03:47:10.380]   I really enjoyed it.
[03:47:10.380 --> 03:47:11.420]   - We'll do it again.
[03:47:11.420 --> 03:47:12.500]   Thank you for joining me today
[03:47:12.500 --> 03:47:14.580]   for my discussion with Dr. Lane Norton.
[03:47:14.580 --> 03:47:17.440]   I hope you found it to be as interesting and informative

[03:47:48.460 --> 03:47:50.740]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[03:47:50.740 --> 03:47:53.560]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.
[03:47:53.560 --> 03:47:55.640]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:57.700]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:47:57.700 --> 03:48:00.760]   for things like sleep, hormone augmentation, and focus.
[03:48:00.760 --> 03:48:02.460]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:48:02.460 --> 03:48:05.180]   on various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:08.520]   please go to livemomentus.com/huberman.
[03:48:08.520 --> 03:48:09.920]   We partnered with Momentus
[03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:12.400]   because they are extremely high quality,
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:14.040]   they ship internationally,
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:17.100]   and they formulated supplements in the precise ways
[03:48:17.100 --> 03:48:19.700]   that are discussed as optimal to take
[03:48:19.700 --> 03:48:22.460]   for various outcomes here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:48:22.460 --> 03:48:24.840]   The Huberman Lab also has a zero cost newsletter

[03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:39.600]   and look for the neural network newsletter signup.
[03:48:39.600 --> 03:48:40.800]   You just provide your email,
[03:48:40.800 --> 03:48:43.160]   and I assure you we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:44.660]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[03:48:44.660 --> 03:48:46.240]   Again, go to HubermanLab.com
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:48.480]   and sign up for the neural network newsletter.
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:50.980]   And if you're not already following us on social media,
[03:48:50.980 --> 03:48:54.140]   we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, Huberman Lab on Twitter,
[03:48:54.140 --> 03:48:55.740]   and Huberman Lab on Facebook.
[03:48:55.740 --> 03:48:57.380]   And at all of those sites,
[03:48:57.380 --> 03:48:59.700]   I provide science and science-related tools
[03:48:59.700 --> 03:49:01.680]   for mental health, physical health, and performance,
[03:49:01.680 --> 03:49:03.600]   some of which overlap with information
[03:49:03.600 --> 03:49:05.420]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:07.740]   but often which is distinct from information
[03:49:07.740 --> 03:49:09.260]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[03:49:09.260 --> 03:49:11.020]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[03:49:11.020 --> 03:49:12.480]   Twitter, and Facebook.
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:13.740]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:49:13.740 --> 03:49:16.060]   for today's discussion with Dr. Lane Norton.
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:17.980]   If you are interested in some of the resources
[03:49:17.980 --> 03:49:20.860]   that he and I discussed, including his carbon app,
[03:49:20.860 --> 03:49:23.160]   as well as other resources that he provides,
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:25.940]   please go to the links in the show note captions.
[03:49:25.940 --> 03:49:28.000]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:29.920]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:32.500]   [upbeat music]
[03:49:32.500 --> 03:49:35.080]   (upbeat music)
