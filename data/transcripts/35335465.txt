[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.240]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.020]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.960]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.720]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.120]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.200]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.640]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.860]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.160]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.600]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.480]   So, go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.840]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   Well listeners, I'm happy to be back with you
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.500]   for this episode.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.440]   We are gonna be talking mock trial.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.440]   Mock trial is the capstone event of Challenge B.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.560]   And I remember as a young parent thinking,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   I know nothing about trials, mock or otherwise,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.420]   and I don't know how to shepherd my student
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.360]   through this process.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240]   And I had tons of questions.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.920]   And even as a Challenge B tutor,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.400]   I wasn't sure that I knew what I needed to know
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.040]   in order to help my students
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.480]   get the most out of the experience.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.240]   So, we are gonna approach all of those questions
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.480]   and more with a good expert today.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.880]   I have with me Emily Martin,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   and Emily is the academic advisor with CCMM.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.060]   She helps directors and parents help their students
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.060]   get the very most out of everything Challenge B related.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   And Emily actually oversees Challenge A, B and 1.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.960]   So she knows where these B students are coming from,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260]   and she knows where they're going.
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.160]   So Emily, I appreciate you being with us
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.880]   to share your knowledge with all of us.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.160]   - Well, thank you for having me today.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.800]   - I think it's gonna be a fun conversation.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.600]   Full disclosure, I love Challenge B.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800]   I've taught other levels,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.600]   but I keep coming back to the fact
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.200]   that I think I just must be an eighth grader at heart
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.640]   because I love Challenge B.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.280]   And I will confess that mock trial
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.440]   was one of my favorite parts about Challenge B.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   So maybe I'm slightly prejudiced,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.040]   but I think there's something for everybody to love.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.760]   Now, Emily, I happen to know
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   that you also have tutored Challenge B for years.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.120]   So you know what families are like
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240]   when they first come into the program.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.460]   What do they have the most questions about
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.880]   when they first come in and they're wondering
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.040]   what is it their students are gonna study this year?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.840]   What about Challenge B gets their radar pinging?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.720]   - Yeah, I think the biggest thing
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.000]   that most parents are unfamiliar with
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760]   when they go into B really is the logic,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.880]   the formal logic, it's our reasoning strand.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.560]   And because it can be a little intimidating
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   if it's something you're unfamiliar with.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.360]   So I think that's the biggest thing
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.260]   that parents are questioning
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.240]   when they look at the B curriculum.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   - Yep, yep.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.360]   - And I would say they are unfamiliar,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.200]   but kind of excited about mock trial.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.120]   - Yeah, it sounds like some, well, okay.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.840]   It does sound like it might be more fun than formal logic.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.800]   I will admit that.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.620]   - Yes.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.680]   (both laughing)
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.520]   - And you're right.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   Even if they're not familiar with it,
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.960]   it sounds like something that they would like to explore
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.920]   along with their student.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.840]   That's really true.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.680]   Have you had many parents
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   in the years that you've been tutoring B,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.440]   have you had many parents that have mock trial experience?
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.840]   - Other than the occasional attorney parent?
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.560]   No, I think very few have any experience with it.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.880]   So I think most parents enjoy going through the process
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.360]   with their child.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.600]   - I think you're right.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   This is really funny.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.480]   I was part of a community that was very old.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.360]   Like I joined in 2004 and that was their third year.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   So this community had been at it for a while.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.720]   And so I tutored for many years
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.200]   in a community that was very deep.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.920]   And so I ended up with students and parents
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.720]   who had been through it with a sibling before.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.360]   So a lot of times I had families
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.800]   that were familiar with mock trial
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.960]   even if the current student was kind of green.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.600]   So that makes a difference too.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   - It does, yeah.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.320]   - So just for listeners that we have
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.000]   who maybe they don't have a child in Challenge B yet,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.160]   they're just thinking what's gonna come next
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.920]   or what is this mock trial of which you speak?
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   Describe the whole,
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   'cause it is a semester long course or project really.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.480]   Describe it for us just in simple terms
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.920]   that we non-lawyers can understand.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.760]   - Sure, okay.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.400]   So I'll go through the parts of it
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.920]   and then I'll delve into the details.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.200]   - Okay, that's awesome.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.240]   - So the first thing is the mock trial notebook.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.160]   Everybody has access to the mock trial notebook.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.600]   They read through the case summary,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   like what is the case?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.440]   - Right, okay.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   So that's where they get the story
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.960]   that they're playing with, right?
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.800]   - Right, and then they'll read through the evidence,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.240]   they develop a strategy and then they tell the story.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.720]   And that is the day of the mock trial.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.800]   So the mock trial notebook,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.920]   it's the rules of the whole mock trial.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.600]   We want all teams to go into it
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.240]   with the same rules and regulations, if you will,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.880]   so that there are no surprises on the day of.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.160]   So that if we have really an even playing field
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.280]   among the teams.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.440]   The mock trial also, it's the entire case.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.680]   It's the evidence.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.200]   Nobody should use anything outside
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   of the mock trial notebook.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.840]   - Okay, so they don't make up stuff that goes into there.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.600]   Okay, got it, got it.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.280]   - I mean, there might be the occasional,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.720]   well, wait, what is this word?
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   I don't even know what this word means.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.680]   And they might look it up, but that's okay.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.520]   But as far as--
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.600]   - They don't add evidence or add parts to the story
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.640]   that aren't provided for everybody.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.680]   - Correct, yes.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.200]   - Gotcha.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.960]   - So one kid might have a parent
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.640]   who is a construction worker
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.840]   and they really know all the ins and outs of a crane.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.560]   But unfortunately, you can only use
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.600]   what's in the mock trial notebook.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.120]   - Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.960]   - Yeah.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.400]   - Good reminder.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.080]   - From there, they read the case summary.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.240]   It's the facts of what happened
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.640]   on the day of the event in question during the trial.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.160]   So they read all the background information about the case.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.520]   They learn the characters who was involved in the case.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.240]   From there, they'll read the witness statements.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.400]   They have, we have five witnesses and the students.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.200]   They read the witness statements.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.360]   They reread the witness statements.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.440]   They summarize the witness statements.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.560]   They rewrite the witness statements.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.400]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.440]   - They know these people in and out.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   - Yes.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.200]   - They will spend weeks reading the witness statements
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   and really diving in.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.320]   - Yeah.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.720]   - That's the heart of the trial.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560]   - Yep.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.400]   - And then they'll read through all the evidence
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.480]   and they put the pieces together and they figure out,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.840]   oh, well, this guy keeps talking
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.360]   about the weather on the day.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.040]   And then you dig through the evidence.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.120]   Oh, look, there's a weather report.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.480]   Then they figure out why is this important?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.680]   - Yes.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.320]   - And then about a third of the way through the semester,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   the director or tutor assigns the students
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.200]   their roles.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.480]   And depending on the size of the challenge B group
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.480]   that year, the students may play one role.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.800]   They may play two roles,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.040]   but each team will have two to four attorneys.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.080]   They'll have all their witnesses in the bailiff.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.240]   And at that point, it's up to the students as a group
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   to come up with how they'll question their witnesses,
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.400]   the strategy they're going to come up with.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.280]   - Wow. - They really learn their roles.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.360]   They gather their costumes.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.440]   And then that all leads up to the day of the mock trial
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.800]   where they will present it to a judge.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.160]   - Wow. - And then the important part
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.920]   is on the day of that mock trial,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.000]   aside from the judge and the administrator,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.720]   they are not allowed to speak to any other adults.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.440]   - Wow. - It is up to them.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.120]   - So they're really on their own, but they've practiced.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.160]   They've prepared for a whole semester.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.640]   - Exactly, yes.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.320]   And so the role of the director at this point or the tutor
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   is they oversee the discussion and the communication.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.120]   And that's also the role of the parent at home
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.680]   is they have to be careful to not coach,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.440]   not tell them what questions to ask,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.920]   but they ask the questions to the student.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.960]   They say, "Oh, well, hey, they have a weather report
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.680]   "here in the evidence.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.080]   "Why do you think that's important?"
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.320]   - "Where does that fit?
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.960]   "Where might that fit in?"
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   - Yeah, there's this piece of garbage that they found
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.160]   that they stuck in this evidence folder.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.800]   Why is that piece of trash important to the case?
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.360]   So what do you think?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   So it's a lot of learning to ask your students
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.760]   the good questions and that will lead them
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.440]   to where they need to go.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.160]   And they eventually, it starts off as a confusing process.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.040]   But over time, they sort out these puzzle pieces
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.200]   and they create the bigger picture by the end.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.080]   And they really grasp it at the end
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.720]   and it's a really beautiful process to watch.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.800]   - Oh, Emily, that sounds so encouraging.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.520]   I'm gonna ask you this question that all of my parents,
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.000]   every year, I taught B for a long time,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.480]   I got this question every year.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.920]   Can eighth graders really do this?
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   Can they really do this?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   It seems, even just listening to you describe it so clearly
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.640]   and in such a simple way, I see why parents ask.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.240]   How are eighth graders,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.760]   how are our classical conversations?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.000]   Eighth graders, these are 13 year olds,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.240]   how are they prepared to do that?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.120]   - They absolutely can do it.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.480]   And I think many of them, what I saw in my students
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.480]   was excitement and then fear in the headlights.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.600]   - Yes, yes.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.280]   - A little bit of anxiety.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.680]   And then it all comes together and they learn,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.280]   wait, we can do this.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.640]   They learn to wrestle with the hard things.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.880]   - Yes, I love that.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.280]   - And you have to remind them,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.000]   hey, you've spent years in foundations
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.160]   working on your presentation skills.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.600]   Remember all that formal logic we were doing
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.120]   through the reasoning strand
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.640]   and then challenge A, the analogies.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.320]   You learn to think the complicated thoughts.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.840]   The logic strand as they're working through their math
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.080]   and their algebra, they're moving variables around
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.360]   and figuring out how to work this formula,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.840]   which is what they're doing in mock trial.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.440]   They're moving things around and laying it out.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.480]   So their brain has already been working
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.360]   on these skills over time.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.600]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.640]   - And their brain knows how to transfer that information.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.600]   And then the persuasive essays that they've been working on
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.720]   for the past year and a half.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   They have learned how to formulate good arguments already.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.080]   Just the format is different,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.000]   but they absolutely can do it.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.240]   - Yes, and also going on in the same semester,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.520]   they're writing their own short story.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   So they have seen all the elements of a short story,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   the rising action and the hook and the character development
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.920]   and how to milk the suspense
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.320]   and how to tie all the ends together.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.600]   They can use those same kinds of skills
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.920]   in the story they create through testimony
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.520]   for the mock trial.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.920]   Really it comes down to who tells the most compelling story.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   - Right.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.720]   - And so that is really cool.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.440]   I would have to agree with you.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.960]   I had parents say every year,
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.520]   I think this is too much for these students.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.200]   I think this is just asking too much of them.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.680]   But I agree with you.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.000]   I see it come together and you're right.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.080]   It does look like a bunch of buzzing bees at the beginning
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   and they're just kind of bumbling around.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   But if they will listen to you as you lay out the process
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   and if they will work the process and wrestle together,
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.640]   they create something that they and their parents
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.120]   could not possibly imagine
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.920]   that they could do with such grace.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.840]   I think that's really amazing.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   So what have you seen your students learn by participating?
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.560]   'Cause you talked about that they are using
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   and continuing to sharpen their skills of logical thinking
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.680]   and moving variables around.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.960]   They are working on their persuasive speech skills.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.440]   I love that you brought out
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.920]   they're learning to ask good questions
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   'cause parents and the tutors
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.680]   model the asking of good questions.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.760]   But the student mock trial
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.880]   is all about asking the best question
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.920]   to elicit the information you want to come out.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.760]   What else?
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.200]   What did the students learn by participating in mock trial?
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.600]   Well, I think one thing that they really learn how to do
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.080]   and they've done it for years,
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.960]   but this is kind of in a different way is attend.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   They have to attend to the information given to them.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.760]   And so many details, right?
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.480]   There's so many details.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.840]   And what is important to one person,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.160]   another person may not find it to be important
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.240]   until they say, "No, this is important
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.960]   because in another student, I had no idea.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.640]   I never thought of it that way."
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.360]   Oh, wow, I missed that, yeah.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.480]   It's like reading your Bible.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.720]   You can read it 15 times
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.800]   and get something new every single time.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.920]   Oh, what a good point.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.600]   That's a great analogy, Emily.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.360]   Yeah, so they really have to learn to attend to the detail,
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.560]   which is something they learned how to do way early on
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.240]   and when they're five years old,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.040]   when they're studying a flower, they're attending,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.360]   but this is a different way to attend to something.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.080]   They're also learning comparison.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.320]   They're saying, "Wow, okay, well, this witness,
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.160]   he's saying this, but this witness is saying this.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.560]   Okay, let's compare these."
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.400]   Yes.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.560]   Yeah, so they're really looking at that comparison
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.920]   and the circumstances under which the event happened.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.200]   So they're looking at their circumstances.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.000]   And considering what's possible and what's not possible.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.600]   Exactly, yes.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.440]   Yeah, and like, "Well, wait, well, this character
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.200]   is saying, well, something was happening here.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.000]   This one's saying this was going on elsewhere.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.920]   How did those relate to each other?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.520]   What's the relationship between this guy and that guy?"
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.680]   And of course, testimony.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.880]   You know, all the information and the facts.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.160]   Yeah, and then on the day,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.800]   as they're preparing for the day of.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   So most of that happens beforehand, right?
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.040]   You know, in the weeks leading up to the big event.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.520]   Right, what you do in class and what they do at home, right.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.040]   Yeah, but about the week or two before,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.200]   at that point, they're really working
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.600]   on the five canons of rhetoric.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   So they're saying, "Okay, what do I already know
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.920]   about what happened?"
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.680]   Perhaps it's the attorney preparing their opening statement
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.880]   or the closing statement.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   Then they're inventing their speech.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.840]   They're arranging it.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   They're putting things in order.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.960]   Like, "Okay, maybe I should bring up this point first.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.640]   And then I'm gonna talk about this aspect of the case."
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.960]   They're choosing their style, right?
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.920]   They're working on their elocution
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.400]   and the delivery, the actual delivery.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.560]   And all of them really go through those steps,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.960]   whether they're a witness or an attorney.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.800]   Absolutely.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.480]   Because they have to, as the witnesses,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.640]   they're playing the character.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.720]   Like, "Okay, how am I gonna play this character?
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.120]   What style, what attitude is this person gonna have?
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.960]   Yeah, should I cry?
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.120]   I don't know."
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.520]   Yes, yes.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.320]   Oh my goodness, yeah.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.720]   All of it adds up to the total experience,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.600]   which adds to the persuasion of your team's story.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.440]   Yes.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.720]   And so really, I mean,
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.480]   the mock trial is a beautiful example
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.840]   of how all of the 15 skills come together
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.240]   for one capstone event.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.640]   I find that to be really true.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.200]   In the years that I did BE,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.600]   I saw my students sharpen all of those skills,
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.680]   like you said, of attending and of arranging
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.360]   and of comparing and of delivering.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.080]   All of those.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.960]   And then there were new attitudes
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.240]   and other skills that I watched the students
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:30.000]   gain or sharpen that they were gonna be able
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.920]   to take forward.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.240]   You know, they have to learn to work as a team.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.640]   Right.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.480]   You know, a lot of the work that our students do,
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.400]   even they come to the community day
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.760]   and they wrestle with ideas,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.240]   but then they go home and what they do at home
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.640]   is really what determines a good bit of their success.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.440]   But mock trial is very different.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.840]   It is a team sport and there's not a...
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.320]   The assessment at the end is very much dependent
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.240]   on the team and how well people prepare and work together.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.080]   So one of the things that I always found students learned
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.440]   was how to work together well, how to cooperate.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.640]   What are some other attitudes or skills
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.760]   or even experiences that you've watched your students
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.520]   have and create that they can take forward
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.000]   to upper challenges?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.400]   Right, I think the working together as a team
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.280]   is most important.
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.360]   For most of these students,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.120]   this is the biggest task or project they've had to do.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.840]   Yes, the most public facing one anyway.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   Yeah, and they're learning how to do this with other people.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.720]   And this might be one of the first times
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.160]   they're really having to come together
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.040]   and collaborate on something big.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.120]   So they are learning to work together
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.680]   and they're learning those communication skills.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.840]   They're learning humility, admit when,
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.680]   "Oh, you know what?
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.840]   "I was wrong about this.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.680]   "You're right.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.200]   "It says it right here in the mock trial notebook."
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.800]   - Yeah, or your way is better, yeah.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.720]   - Yeah, they are having to set aside their own ideas
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.120]   and admit that somebody else's idea was better.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.520]   They're learning how to lay out the groundwork
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.800]   for a huge project.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.240]   So they're learning time management skills.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.160]   - That's great.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.000]   - They might be learning administration skills,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   like organization, how to use a Google Docs sheet
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.120]   or something like that.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.680]   - Oh, wow, true.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.120]   - So they can share their information with one another
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.880]   via email whenever they're having...
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.760]   So because, again, we're talking about 13 year olds,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.840]   they don't have the control
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   over their parents' calendar either.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.960]   So they're still having to work together.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.080]   So sometimes those can't always be face-to-face meetings.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.720]   So a lot of students in today's technology,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.080]   they'll meet over a video call.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.040]   They'll share documents via email with one another
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.800]   so they can work on their project.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   So they're learning so many other skills in doing this.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.840]   But I think some of the biggest ones were the communication
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.360]   and the humility, really, is a big one
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.200]   because 13 year olds,
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.720]   they're dealing with a lot of growing up at this point
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.080]   in their lives.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.280]   And so learning how to do these things gracefully
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.160]   is a big skill that they're learning.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:36.560]   - My daughter says that part of growing up
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.440]   is learning that it's not ready, fire, aim.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.320]   It's ready, aim, fire.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.120]   And so our 13 year olds sometimes speak before they think
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.040]   and they empty their gun before they really consider
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.320]   where should I be shooting?
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.480]   And so you're right.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.680]   That is learning to communicate
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.800]   and work with humility and grace
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   and offer mercy both to your teammates and to yourself.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.800]   Another thing that I think is absolutely huge
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.080]   that students gain by participating
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.800]   is a huge measure of confidence.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.120]   - Yes.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.920]   - They come in and this is a big task.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.120]   I mean, this is,
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.880]   I've had judges for mock trial before.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.600]   Like we would go and recruit real judges
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.160]   to be the judges in the trial
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.720]   and they would address the teams after the event was over
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.760]   and they would just be kind of looking at these kids.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   I've had judges say, "Now, who coached your team?"
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.880]   "Well, this group of homeschool mommas did."
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.000]   And you know, "And how old are y'all?"
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   "13."
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.480]   And they would just shake their head in wonderment
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.160]   and say, "There are law school students
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.640]   who have never done a mock trial like this before.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.760]   They are in law school and they've not done this."
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.520]   So the confidence that it inspires in our children
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.240]   that they can do a hard thing
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   and with perseverance and teamwork do it well is huge.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.680]   I mean, parents come to mock trial
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.720]   on the day of the real mock trial
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.360]   and they look and they have told me later,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.600]   "I didn't recognize my son.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.920]   I didn't recognize my daughter.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.040]   They became somebody else.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   I didn't know they had that in them."
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.920]   And the students don't know either until it comes out
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.800]   and then they know that they were able to do it.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.000]   And that's great.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.280]   It's a huge shot in the arm of confidence.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.120]   - It is.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.360]   And it's so beautiful to see the confidence
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.400]   that comes through this whole process.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.920]   There was the father of one of my students
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.120]   or is an attorney.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.040]   And when she was working on her mock trial case,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.240]   he said, "This is more in depth than what we did
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.040]   in mock trial here in law school."
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.320]   - It's so amazing.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.480]   It's just amazing.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.680]   Our kids are used to working hard
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.880]   and producing excellent results.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.120]   And so that's how they work.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.600]   What do you think, Emily,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.200]   what have you seen as the most challenging thing
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.280]   for students to learn in mock trial?
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.800]   So what's the hardest thing for them as they come into this
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.840]   and how can we as parents help with this?
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.160]   - Yeah, so I think one of the biggest things,
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.880]   well, of course, you know, we said working together,
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.160]   so coaching them through the open communication
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.640]   and not get heated.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.040]   - Right, don't get your feelings hurt.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.280]   Don't demand your own way kind of thing.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.200]   - Yep.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.120]   But a practical thing I think is their organization.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.520]   There are a lot of moving pieces to mock trial.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:59.280]   And so teaching your student how to organize their material
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   I think is huge.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.120]   - Yes.
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.600]   Even if you as a parent don't know
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.640]   the ins and outs of mock trial,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   you are a grownup and you probably have more,
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.160]   well, you have more ideas than your kid
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.440]   about good organizational methods.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.080]   That's really great.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.920]   And that's-
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.040]   - Figuring out how to do it well is, yeah.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.280]   - Yes.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   Because that will help your student be able to move
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.320]   more smoothly through the parts
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.360]   and always find what they're looking for.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.480]   That's really good.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.320]   - Exactly.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.320]   So whatever method you find works for your students,
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   some people it's color coding.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.880]   Like, okay, every witness has their own color.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   Or it's folders or index cards or a binder and it's tabs.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.840]   Whatever works, figure out a system.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.760]   Because again, they're referencing this material
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.360]   over and over and over again.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.200]   - Yes.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.000]   - So it might be, okay, I need to make five copies of this
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.200]   because every witness needs this particular,
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.840]   they relate to this particular document.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.200]   So I need to have it in every folder.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.000]   Or making notes about line numbers.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.840]   Those line numbers on the witness statements
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.680]   are immensely helpful.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   - They are, they are.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.000]   That's really good.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.760]   That's very, very good.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.440]   I think sometimes scheduling is another thing.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.920]   Helping your students.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.200]   I don't know, A and B students tend to think
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.680]   that things take less time than they really do.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.520]   - Yes.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.120]   - Especially when they involve other people or cooperation.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.760]   'Cause you can't just assume
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.240]   that everybody can meet when you can meet.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.480]   And so I think that that's one thing
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.160]   that parents can easily step in and help with
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.480]   is arranging times and helping their student
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.160]   with realistic time management.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.000]   - Right.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.120]   What do you think is the hardest part
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.040]   of mock trial for parents?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.600]   And what is it that would help us
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.720]   if we could know or remember as parents
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.320]   what will help us shepherd our students?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.920]   - So the biggest thing is to step back and not help.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.760]   - That is hard.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.600]   - That is so hard.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.440]   - That's hard.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.680]   That is hard, especially if you get interested yourself.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.760]   - Yes, because we see where it should go.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.120]   Our brains are more developed.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.240]   We have, you know, we're a little older.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.840]   We can see the bigger picture.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.680]   - We can see these big holes.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.880]   We see the big holes in the case
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.280]   or the thing that could be turned to our advantage, yeah.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.800]   - Yes, and so you're biting your tongue
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.160]   trying not to tell your student,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.000]   this is what you need to do.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.640]   - Look there, look there.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.360]   - So we have to ask the questions.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.240]   Okay, so you have that piece of evidence in front of you.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.440]   Who might talk about this?
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.280]   - Right.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.400]   - Who brought this up?
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   And why do you think he mentioned this?
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.880]   So we have to ask the questions
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.440]   for them to connect those dots.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.560]   And oh, that is so hard.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.400]   - It is.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.360]   - And also you mentioned it a little while ago.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.840]   The students have such a hard time seeing their schedule.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.520]   They don't think it's gonna take as long.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.960]   So making sure they're working on it every day.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.800]   Hey, you know what?
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.480]   You really need to read these pages again
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.280]   because the mock trial notebook does not only discuss
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.320]   the ins and outs of the case,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.880]   it tells you about courtroom procedure.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.840]   - So it's those little details
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.320]   that the students have to read over and over again
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.840]   to say, oh, look.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.120]   So we had a situation when we did mock trial
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.640]   where the student was supposed to say something,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.520]   oh, I rest my case.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.520]   And we as a whole just did not read over that page.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.320]   We did not attend to that page.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.680]   And so the child on the other team
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.160]   was waiting for our attorney to say that.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.000]   The judge was waiting for him to say that.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.160]   Nobody knew.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.720]   It was a little awkward.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.200]   We finally got it.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.040]   They finally figured it.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.760]   And I, as a director, could not say in the middle of,
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.040]   hey, you need to say this.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.960]   - Say it, say it.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.840]   - We were not allowed to talk.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.360]   So it was a bit of a moment before he was like,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.280]   no, well, we're not done.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.000]   We have our cross-examined questions,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.480]   but that's not what they were getting at.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.320]   - Right.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.600]   - Attend to the courtroom rules and regulations
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.440]   of the mock trial notebook.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.840]   Make sure your student reads those pages too,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.480]   not just the case pages.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.320]   - That's good.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.400]   - And also as a parent,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.680]   it is so important you volunteer your time,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   your home, resources to help these students come together
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   to work on this project.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.000]   If every parent would volunteer one day,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.200]   it could happen where they can meet
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.880]   outside of their normal CC time,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.520]   especially if you're teaming up with another community
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.240]   who might have community day on another day.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.080]   - Yeah.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.920]   - And that's what we did.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.640]   So it was a lot of Fridays that we spent coming together
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.680]   as two individual communities to come together
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.480]   to form one team.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.080]   And so, you know, gracious,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.600]   offer your time to pick up a few students
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.520]   and meet at a location or offer your home.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   Snacks go a long way too.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.360]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.760]   - The kids love to eat.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.520]   At 13, they can eat a lot of snacks in two hours.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.360]   - Yeah.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.200]   - Yeah.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.020]   That's good.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.860]   That is really good.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.800]   And the whole family can be involved
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.520]   in that kind of hospitality.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.360]   - Yeah.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.400]   - You know, there are ways to involve your whole family
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.240]   in mock trial.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.640]   You know, you could be a practice witness.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.080]   You could read the script of being the practice witness
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.320]   and you could help ask questions
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.320]   or you could get your other students in your home
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.840]   to try to poke holes in the case
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.640]   or to have somebody read a statement
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   and say what's not clear.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.800]   'Cause sometimes as the mock trial participant,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.320]   you know what you mean by everything
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.720]   'cause all that is in your head.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.360]   But people who are hearing the trial,
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:15.120]   including the judge who will be at the trial,
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.420]   haven't rehearsed this and they don't have all the context.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.120]   And that's part of what your students
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.880]   on the mock trial team have to provide.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.640]   They have to provide enough context for the story
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.240]   for it to make sense to somebody who's hearing it
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.160]   for the first time.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.920]   - Right, and that's why those direct examination questions
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.880]   are so important.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.120]   And we had to remind the students,
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.240]   it's the direct examination questions that tell the story.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.560]   - That's how the story gets out there.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.720]   - Yes.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.760]   - Absolutely.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.160]   Why do teams do the trial twice?
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.880]   What is the value of that?
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.200]   - Yeah, so it's not a requirement to do it twice
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.700]   but it is incredibly helpful
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.580]   because the first, like a dress rehearsal,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.760]   there are always hiccups
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.360]   and like how I wish I could have done this differently.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.200]   - Right.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.400]   - So you get an opportunity to do it twice
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.440]   and it helps build their confidence.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.760]   - It does and it gets their nervousness out.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.600]   - Yes.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.720]   - They discover that you don't turn into a toad
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.760]   and you don't die.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.640]   And if you make a stumble,
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.120]   you just take a deep breath and go on and you get better.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.240]   Yeah, I think it's incredibly valuable to Emily
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.740]   to do it more than once
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.500]   'cause you get the nerves out the first time.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.340]   - Exactly.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.380]   So if you live in an area
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.780]   where there are multiple challenge B communities,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.180]   yeah, I recommend doing it twice
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.380]   or even a round robin works really well.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.540]   So you have three communities, they get a chance.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.780]   So I'll go, make their rounds
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:51.900]   and everybody gets a chance to do it twice.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.460]   So it is really helpful.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.300]   And I think the students appreciate that second time around
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.420]   so they feel better.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.800]   - They've worked so hard for so long.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.260]   - Yes, to this one objective, yeah.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.220]   - And so it's like, yeah, practicing months and months
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.100]   and only get to do the dance one time.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   Well, no, let's do it a couple of times.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.180]   - I know, they love it.
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.380]   And I will just say,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.860]   I've had more challenge B students
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.740]   who come out of challenge B determined to be attorneys
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.460]   'cause they ended up loving mock trial
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.220]   and some who actually kept that love
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.340]   and went on to be attorneys,
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:36.860]   but some who just really valued the skills
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.980]   that they gained and that they got to practice.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.460]   So you have done this for how many years?
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.500]   How many years have you done challenge B?
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.940]   - Well, I've only led challenge B one year,
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.300]   but I've become intimately familiar with challenge B
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.780]   through my role as an AA.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.780]   - And supporting it for several years as well, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.940]   So between us, we probably have 10 years of experience
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.220]   with challenge B.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.300]   For you, what has been the biggest revelation
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.980]   as you have helped with mock trial,
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:16.460]   as a tutor, as a parent, as an academic advisor,
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.620]   biggest revelations for you?
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:22.420]   - Yeah, our children can do the hard things
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.660]   and they can do them well.
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.980]   - Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   - And I think the beauty of the entire challenge B year
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:39.340]   is the theme of our young students can do the hard things.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.340]   In the first half of the year,
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.940]   we read so much literature about these children
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.420]   working hard to support their families
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.140]   and to meet their goals.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.140]   So we read these books about 13, 14-year-old students
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.500]   working for years to earn the money to do something
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.580]   or having to actually support their family.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.060]   They're doing things in these stories
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.940]   and one of them is a true story,
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.460]   Ralph Moody in "Little Britches."
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.300]   - Yes.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.580]   - Their family was poor and he had to actually earn money
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.540]   to help their family survive.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.220]   And he was doing chores on their farm
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.580]   that our parents today,
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.420]   and I speak as a mother of a 13-year-old,
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.900]   we would never allow my child to do some of these things
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.180]   that they're being asked to do.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.940]   And so I think we forget that in our modern society
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.940]   that God built these young teenagers to do hard things,
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.340]   whether it's physically or intellectually,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:48.300]   they are so much more capable than what we think they are.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.580]   And so I think that's really important
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.580]   for us to keep in mind that meeting a hard spot,
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.420]   meeting a difficult spot in life is a good thing.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.780]   It helps with growth.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.980]   - Yes, yes, that's great.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.420]   That is a great revelation.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:09.220]   And that was definitely one of mine too,
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:10.740]   that they could do hard things.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.660]   But another revelation that I had was that our children,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.700]   through activities like Community Day
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.660]   and the Mock Trial Project,
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.300]   our students learn to love their neighbors well.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.140]   - Yes.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:35.060]   - And particularly, I actually had both of my daughters
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.740]   in Challenge B as students also.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.020]   So I have years worth of students
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.020]   that I adopted into my heart
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.500]   and two students that were born into my heart.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.780]   And there are some beautiful pictures
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.940]   of students learning to love one another,
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.860]   to bear one another's burdens.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.860]   I saw students who would come alongside a classmate
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.620]   who was utterly wigged out by public speaking
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.660]   and did not, just really didn't know if they could do it.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.460]   And I saw teammates come alongside that person and say,
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.780]   "This is gonna be okay, you can do this.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.860]   Here's what you, here's a trick I've used."
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.260]   Or, "When you're nervous, you can look at me."
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:27.260]   And I saw teammates push papers of notes of encouragement
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:33.820]   or next steps to a teammate
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.540]   when they got flustered during a trial.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.340]   I saw them hold each other up
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.420]   and I saw them hold each other accountable.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.940]   I saw them say to one another,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:48.180]   "You know what, you're not doing the work at home.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.220]   You're not practicing, you're hurting our team.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.860]   You need to step it up."
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.860]   They learned how to give mercy and grace
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:03.020]   and also to hold each other accountable for things.
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:06.940]   And that was a huge revelation to me
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:11.300]   that those students learn to love one another so well
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.780]   through this academic experience.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.340]   - Yeah, we had, on the day of our mock trial,
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.300]   one of our students got sick
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.820]   and she was one of our attorneys.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.620]   And so we had one of our other students step up
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.940]   and had to take over her role literally the last minute.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.340]   - Man, yeah.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.580]   - But had they not all come together
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.100]   and work together as a whole group
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.180]   and had this other student not been prepared
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.940]   or shared her notes, it would have been done.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.780]   - That's right.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.180]   - And so at the end, she eventually showed up,
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.180]   but she was only able to attend it.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.100]   She was no longer able to participate by that point.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.100]   But the other student went up to her and said,
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   "Thank you so much because you prepared so much
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.060]   and we had this all available.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.220]   I was able to do it."
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.700]   So thank you so much.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.540]   So yeah, it was just that coming together
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.900]   and the thanksgiving for one another.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:09.740]   - Yeah.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.220]   - And yeah, the encouragement.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:16.220]   We had one student, and this is also a tip for parents.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.380]   One of our students was profoundly dyslexic
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:23.980]   and just has a really difficult time reading lengthy passages
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.660]   and the print in the mock trial notebook is kind of small.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:28.500]   - Small.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.340]   - And so the mother read through all the witness statements
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.860]   and he played one of our witnesses.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.380]   She read through the witness statement and recorded it
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.820]   so he could listen to it over and over and over again.
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.660]   And so the students--
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.500]   - Great idea.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.340]   - Yeah, and I think it was one of the other students
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.580]   who suggested that to him, saying,
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.420]   "Hey, have your mom read it so you can listen to it."
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.220]   Just like, and listen to it over and over.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.260]   So I think it was one of the other students encouraged that.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.700]   - And so it was, yeah, beautiful
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   how all these ideas came together
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.500]   and they do learn all of that.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.540]   And it's amazing.
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.860]   On the day of mock trial, I cried.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.900]   It was just so beautiful.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.060]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.140]   And you just think, wow, this is a beautiful picture
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.700]   of what comes of hard work.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.540]   - Yes.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.300]   - And you're so happy for the students.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.220]   It's hard work to be so richly rewarded.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.180]   - Right.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.220]   - That's awesome.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:27.020]   So mock trial is the capstone event.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.980]   It's the crown jewel of Challenge B.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:34.980]   How is it the perfect integration of all the skills
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:40.460]   that our students practice during that Challenge B year?
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.300]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.620]   It does encompass everything.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.460]   - It does.
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.620]   - They are learning the parts
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:52.140]   of the local judicial system.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.580]   And you don't realize it until your child
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.900]   is moving up into the Challenge years.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:01.940]   What they learn in mock trial directly correlates
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.020]   to what they will be doing in Challenge 1.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.860]   - It does.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.780]   - They read "To Kill a Mockingbird,"
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.980]   which is about an entire court case.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.140]   And so, and I asked my students in Challenge 1 this year,
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.020]   I said, "Had you not done mock trial,
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.540]   would you have a good understanding?"
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.380]   - Yeah.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.940]   - And they said, "Nope, it really helped."
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.220]   I'm like, "There you go."
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.500]   They also read "Born Again" by Charles Olson.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.660]   Again, it is about a court case.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.140]   And had they not learned the vocabulary
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.100]   of the parts of a trial,
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.940]   these books that they read in Challenge 1,
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.300]   just, they don't make as much sense.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.140]   - Right, right.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.820]   The context is huge.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:40.740]   - Yeah.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.220]   And so they are learning, again,
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.420]   to name and attend to things
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.620]   in a way that they probably have never attended
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.580]   to anything before, memorizing those details.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.380]   They have to tell the story of what happened
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.780]   on the day of this case,
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.300]   or the day of question of the accident in the mock trial.
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:00.140]   - Right, right.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.700]   - So they're learning the storytelling and expressing.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.580]   They're learning about how events
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.060]   directly correlate to one another.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.580]   And one person's testimony
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.820]   may not be another person's testimony.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.180]   So they're digging for the truth.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.140]   And so, yeah, they just, it all comes together
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.500]   just in one big, cohesive picture
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:28.020]   that, yeah, and they don't realize it
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.340]   until they can look back on it.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.180]   - Right, right.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.540]   When they look back on it, they're amazed.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.380]   - Yeah.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.020]   And they're learning the persuasive arguments,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.980]   which again, come back in Challenge 1,
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.900]   they are learning how to put together
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.140]   a good, solid argument.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.980]   And some of the things that they learned in Challenge A,
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.580]   like the appeal to fear,
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.060]   the appeal to pity.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:49.980]   - Yeah.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.540]   - They learn, they're putting these things together
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.900]   that they may not realize that they are doing
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.260]   until you point them out.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.980]   Like, wow, remember when you were learning in Challenge A
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.460]   about these fallacies,
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.300]   and now let's twist those and put them to your advantage
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.740]   while you're putting together an argument.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:08.940]   - Yes.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.620]   Well, that's what makes it the capstone event
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.220]   because it really does.
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.180]   It is a great synthesis of the skills
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.540]   that our students have been massaging up to that time.
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.460]   Thank you for helping us to see that, Emily.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.820]   And thank you for answering so many questions
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.340]   that parents all over have about mock trial.
[00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.740]   This has been really helpful and informative.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.620]   I appreciate you.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.900]   - Oh, I love it.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.580]   I mean, and I have said this to so many people,
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.020]   they're probably tired of hearing me say it,
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:44.820]   but the amount of growth I think you see in a student
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.020]   during the Challenge B year, it makes me cry.
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.740]   They learn so much work ethic during this year
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.820]   because they think so much of it goes back to
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.660]   our children can do the hard things.
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.060]   And hey, look at what these kids my age
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.980]   were doing 100 years ago.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:05.820]   - Yeah.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:10.100]   - I noticed a difference in my oldest when he went through.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.100]   I would say, "Hey, can you take out the trash?"
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.660]   And a typical 12, 13 year old boy might complain about it.
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.740]   By mid year, I would say,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.460]   "Hey, can you please take out the trash?"
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.540]   "Yep, no problem."
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.580]   Because I think they are learning that,
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.740]   hey, you know what, people really were working hard,
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.100]   much harder than what I'm having to learn this year.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.580]   The amount of maturity that goes into,
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.980]   they just grow up so much in that Challenge B year.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.340]   And it is really great to see.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.260]   - It is a beautiful picture of what God does in our lives
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.980]   as he helps us to become who he wants us to be.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:50.620]   This has been really great.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.180]   And parents, we have talked a lot.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:56.620]   You've heard Emily talk a lot about the 15 skills
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.900]   and the skill of attending and the skill of memorizing
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.980]   and expression and invention and all of those skills.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   If you are looking to become a better everyday educator,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.980]   familiar with all those tools,
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.540]   join other homeschool parents this summer
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.780]   for a 2025 Practicum event.
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.860]   It's hosted by a local CC leader every summer.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:27.300]   And this parent conference will give you an opportunity
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.780]   for fellowship with brand new
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.860]   and experienced homeschool parents,
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.460]   or even just parents who are thinking about homeschooling.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.940]   You'll have the chance to gather and learn
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:42.300]   and practice the classical arts.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.860]   At this year's Practicum,
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.060]   you can practice the 15 skills of learning,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.180]   many of which Emily talked about.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.540]   This year, we're gonna begin using content
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.180]   from the brand new curriculum, the Math Map.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.140]   And so you will get two good things,
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.500]   practice with the 15 skills
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.300]   and perhaps an introduction or a deeper dive
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.780]   into the Math Map curriculum,
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.820]   the brand new math, classical math curriculum,
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.780]   the classical conversations is rolling out.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.700]   You're gonna be surprised at how approachable
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.220]   that curriculum is.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.700]   And you're gonna be able to discuss it
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.260]   with people at all stages of learning.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.980]   So find out when your local Practicum meets
[00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.980]   and you can do that by visiting ccpracticum.com.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.020]   That's ccpracticum.com.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.380]   Hopefully, we will see you all
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.060]   at a local Practicum this summer.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.580]   But even better than that,
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.220]   I hope to see you all or listen to you all
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.740]   next week on The Everyday Educator.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.220]   Thanks, Emily, I appreciate you being with us
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.980]   and I'll talk to you again.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.540]   - Well, thank you for having me.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.200]   you
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:10.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
