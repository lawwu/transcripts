[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Today's show is part personal story and part coaching.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, they're actually going to be intertwined.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   Essentially, I'm going to coach you through my personal story and I'm going to share with
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.600]   you why I believe that you should think slow, move fast, and prioritize your life because
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100]   that's what I'm doing.
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.220]   I'm thinking slow, moving fast, and I'm prioritizing my life and that has led me to the fact that
[00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:51.500]   tomorrow Radical Personal Finance Global Headquarters moves.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.260]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.100]   Thank you for being here.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.700]   I hope you enjoy today's show.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.260]   On Wednesdays I often do technical content but no technical content today.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.180]   Today I'm just going to tell you what I'm doing and why I think it's a good move.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.700]   You've got to judge it for yourself and figure out if what I'm doing is intelligent and then
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:23.660]   consider what you're doing and see if you should implement some of what I am.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.380]   Definitely a big announcement as I sit here today.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.700]   My bookshelves are packed up.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.180]   I've got boxes on the floor.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.520]   My desk is piled high with things and in a few minutes here I'm going to be unplugging
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.180]   all of my computers and podcasting in gear and getting those ready in the boxes.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.020]   Tomorrow morning I'm going to go get a U-Haul truck.
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.620]   We're moving Radical Personal Finance Global Headquarters from the house that we own into
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.620]   a rental apartment.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.620]   It's actually a duplex.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.020]   We'll be renting half of the duplex.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380]   I'll tell you the story behind it.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.020]   I'm not going to go into the details of all of the financial details simply because I'm
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.500]   going to wait until the house is actually sold and then we'll do an autopsy of the finances
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.540]   and I'll share with you how my home ownership adventure has been.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.420]   I'll share the big picture today and I'm pretty excited about the move.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.940]   The major reason I'm excited about it is because it will work out well financially but more
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.420]   importantly it will work out well and better from a lifestyle perspective because it will
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.580]   free up a lot of my time which is time that I can devote to things that are higher priorities
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.660]   for me than owning a fancy house at the moment.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.700]   I'm going to use that outline that I created.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.460]   I'm just not an exhaustive outline for a decision-making process.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.700]   Just basically what came to me as I sat down and said, "What can I share with you today?"
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.820]   Instead of think slow, move fast and prioritize your life.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.060]   I'm going to walk through those.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.980]   First thinking slow.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.340]   The best decisions in life are generally going to be those that are the most carefully considered.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.120]   Deliberate, careful, thoughtful analysis is going to lead to a better decision.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.620]   If you want to develop a success characteristic, one success characteristic that I'd encourage
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.660]   you to develop is the habit of thinking slowly.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.700]   If you can get through about 500 pages of it, go and read Daniel Kahneman's book called
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.860]   Thinking Fast and Slow.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.100]   He's a Nobel Prize winner in economics and essentially the book outlines different types
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.100]   of thinking.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.260]   One system of thinking which is fast and instinctive and emotional and the other system of thinking
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.140]   which is slow thinking which is more deliberate, more logical and more careful.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.340]   Then he walks through the different biases that we have surrounding each type of thinking.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.580]   You skip the book and just simply do this.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.980]   Spend more time thinking carefully about all your decisions and you're going to make better
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.980]   decisions.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.460]   So anytime you can put off a decision, do it.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.780]   Anytime you can take more time to think about it, do it.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.620]   Anytime you can consider a decision more carefully, do it.
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.780]   You're going to make better decisions.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.900]   So always try to protect yourself from fast thinking because emotional decisions, they
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.700]   have their place but for the big things in life, they probably aren't a great place to
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.700]   start.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.780]   Now, for me though, I see different ways to practice this type of thinking because thinking
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.940]   slowly does not necessarily mean that you can or should move slowly.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.580]   Sometimes if you take a moment to think about it or take a night to think about it, you
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.740]   miss the deal.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.020]   Somebody else buys the piece of property that you wanted to buy.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.300]   Sometimes you need to pull out some money and make it happen.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:58.860]   But those types of quick moving, quick acting, fast acting should occur after a thoughtful
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.500]   deliberate process of thinking, slow thinking.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.260]   The way that I like to do that is number one, carefully considering what the goals are.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.420]   Number two, constantly outlining and wargaming different scenarios and different options
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.020]   and doing that completely disconnected from reality in the sense of with no commitment
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.020]   to follow through.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.060]   That's what I do in my journaling.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   That's what I do in my thinking.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.340]   You hear me do that for you here on the show.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.260]   The best example I would illustrate to you is the recent series that I did a couple of
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.380]   months ago on how to prepare to get laid off.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.180]   I'm concerned that in the next recession, many of you who are listening will be laid
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.820]   off from your jobs.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.420]   So what I was doing in that series of three shows, the first show was how to prepare so
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.580]   you don't ever get laid off, how to prepare in case you do get laid off and then, okay,
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.580]   you got laid off.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.580]   Now, here's what to do.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.260]   What I was doing was practicing a process of wargaming with you, trying to expose you
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.540]   to a way of thinking that you possibly weren't thinking about previously and trying to bring
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:07.180]   scenarios that are not real yet to you so that you'll think through them so that if
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.140]   that real scenario happens, then you know what to do.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.980]   The best word I know for this is the word I used, wargaming, and that's where if you
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.900]   look at how military personnel are trained or emergency response personnel, they're trained
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:27.580]   constantly again and again and again and again in the practice of if this, then that.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.900]   Here's an emergency situation.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900]   What do you do?
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.140]   Here's the drill and they drill and they drill and they drill and they drill and they drill
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.220]   and they drill.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.380]   My dad would tell me stories.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.620]   He was an officer in the Navy on a diesel submarine and he would tell me stories of
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.860]   his years of service in the Navy where he talked about, he would just talk about the
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.020]   drills that they would go through and so they would practice, "What do you do if a steam
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.980]   pipe bursts or what do you do in the case of this?"
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.820]   And so you drill those things over and over and over again so that when all of a sudden
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.860]   you open the hatch and you go in and the room is filled with steam and there's boiling steam
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.580]   pouring out of a pipe and you know that, "Wait a second, this is a bad thing," then you don't
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:13.100]   necessarily just jump to adrenaline and make a – you don't jump to the adrenaline response
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.700]   and just make a snap decision.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.740]   Rather, what you do is you immediately revert to the trained drill to the – okay, step
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.260]   one, step two, step three, step four, step five, and you automatically revert because
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.380]   you've drilled that again and again and again.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.180]   So whether you practice this in a military situation, whether you practice it when you're
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.260]   out shooting, you're on the range, "Okay, what do I do?
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:39.940]   Breathe, move, breathe, move, look," constantly practicing how to suppress those emotional
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.820]   responses in favor of the careful consideration.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.380]   So if you practice it in that or just when you drive down the street, "Okay, if this
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.820]   car in front of me turns over or this guy – this truck, what if this truck comes across
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.820]   the median?
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   Where would I go?
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.820]   Where would I move?
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   Would I go left?
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.820]   Would I go right?
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:55.820]   What would be the situation?"
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:01.140]   You're just thinking over time, at least this experience I've had, number one, you
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.700]   probably do it and number two, when you face a situation, you're not overwhelmed by adrenaline.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.740]   You know, "Okay, this is a situation.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.700]   If my car is upside down, I proved this one time when I flipped a car over, okay?
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.620]   Yes, the adrenaline response can come but it needs to be controlled.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.620]   Is everyone okay?
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.620]   Let's get everyone out.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.420]   Let's just react calmly."
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.860]   Now, I don't believe that we can all ever get to a point where we say, "Yeah, I have
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.420]   no ability to – I'm just a machine and this is the way it is."
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.420]   No.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.700]   We're always going to have a natural human response but we can learn to control and moderate
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.220]   those human responses.
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:42.340]   But the best way to do it is by thinking carefully and slowly in advance and running those scenarios.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.980]   So that's – for me, you hear me do it on the show is constantly run scenarios, run
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.800]   scenarios, run scenarios and I do the same in my life.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   Here are my goals.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   How can I do this?
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   Here are my goals.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   How can I do this?
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   What would help me?
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.220]   What would be causing me problems right now?
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.960]   What would be different ways of dealing with these problems?
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.900]   So as I've considered this through in my own life, one of the problems is simply my
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.900]   time and looking at where my time is going and where my time is committed.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.020]   My business right now, Radical Personal Finance, the business that you listen to every day
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:21.420]   or this is the basis of it is I'm stuck in that classic adolescent phase.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.500]   If we were – if Michael Gerber were giving me advice, he would say, "Joshua, you are
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.800]   stuck in the adolescent phase of a business that is being run by an overworked technician
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.560]   where basically I'm from day to day utterly, completely, absolutely overwhelmed every single
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.860]   day with Radical Personal Finance and I'm dropping balls all over the place and doing
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.580]   just a very few things well."
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.340]   Now, I have my priorities clear so I'm OK with the things that I'm doing well and
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.740]   I know that I'm going to continue to drop balls but it can't continue because if it
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.580]   continues, I'll either revert back as following what Gerber teaches.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.820]   I'll either revert back to just the small – smaller than it could be or I have to
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.900]   develop.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.100]   But when I look and do the analysis of what's keeping me from developing, what's keeping
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.440]   me as a businessman from being able to take up – take the next steps and build the business
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.420]   around it, there are two constraints.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.420]   Number one is time.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.540]   Number two is money.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.220]   Now obviously, that's quite shocking because lacks of time and money are – I'm the
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.660]   only one who faces that, right?
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.460]   But it's fairly obvious but then I can run different scenarios.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.900]   How can I overcome these constraints in my situation?
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   There's been different options.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.900]   Well, one of the options that I've considered for a very long time is getting rid of my
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.740]   house and moving.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:47.380]   And the primary benefit of that would be number one, freeing up my time from having to maintain
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:53.300]   the care and maintenance of a large property and simply going to a simpler lifestyle with
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.100]   fewer things to maintain and especially going from an owner perspective to a simple tenant
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:05.180]   perspective where I'm automatically removing some of my responsibilities.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.420]   That can also help possibly with financially.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.860]   But the challenge has been that in my local rental market and based upon when I bought
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.620]   the house and how I bought the house and all of that, when looking at the needs of my family,
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.300]   looking at the fact that I've got two small kids, I've got – my wife and I are both
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.940]   at home full time.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.420]   So we need a little bit more space.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.700]   Looking at the constraints of having a couple of dogs and having a couple of kids, that
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.340]   adds a lot of extra energy to the household.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:42.020]   So the practical impact of those things is I don't – it would not be love from my
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.860]   family for me to move us all into a studio apartment or move us into the back of a van
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.860]   right now.
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:47.860]   I've considered it.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.860]   Don't worry.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860]   I am radical.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.020]   But that would not be an expression of love toward my family.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.700]   If we had to do it, we could do it.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:12:01.060]   But right now, we don't have to do it and so there's a basic level of comfort that
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.100]   is nice to maintain if possible for my family.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.980]   So when I do a survey of the local rental market, rents are high and they're high
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:15.180]   especially when compared to the current housing situation that I have and my current costs
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.680]   which are not extremely high.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.100]   But there's never been a good opportunity to present itself.
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.660]   But I've looked and I've thought and I've looked and I've thought and I've thought
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.540]   slowly about it.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.380]   But at this point, I've actually moved very quickly the instant I found something that
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.380]   could work.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.980]   And the timeline was a few weeks ago, I was having a Friday afternoon call with a friend
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.100]   of mine, a listener of the show reached out to me and said, "Sounds like you need somebody
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.060]   to talk to," and offered to do some masterminding, some coaching with me.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.740]   And so we talk every week and it's really been helpful just to have somebody to talk
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.740]   to.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.860]   Coaching is so valuable but it's often hard to find a good coach.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.060]   And I just talk with him and I tell him what I'm working on.
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.220]   He tells me what he's working on.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.740]   And as we were considering it through, I was just talking again about the fact I'd really
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.900]   love to sell my house to free up more time to execute on some of the balls that are being
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.420]   dropped right now with radical personal finance.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.900]   And in consideration of it, after the call, I was just continuing to think about it.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.660]   We talked about it but I just shared it as an aside.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.780]   And then I decided to make some more phone calls and just check out the market again.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:27.100]   And I called my brother who owns a duplex and I was asking him what he was renting,
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.420]   doing a survey of what he's renting it out for.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.700]   And then all of a sudden I realized that his tenant had just moved from the other side
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.700]   of his duplex.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.980]   So this was Friday at the end of July.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.140]   It was actually July 24.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.540]   Well he told me that his tenant had just moved out.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   He told me what the rents were and I was purely using it as market research.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.140]   He said, "Go look at it."
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.380]   The reason I was using it as market research was I'd never been in the unit before because
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.900]   he'd always had it rented and there was no reason for me to go into the rental side of
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900]   the unit.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900]   So I'd never been inside.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.180]   Well, I went to the rental side of the unit.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:05.900]   I had been in his side of the unit which was quite small and would simply not accommodate
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.060]   my family with our needs.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.840]   But then I went and walked and he said, "Go look at it."
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.620]   So the next day, this was July 25, Saturday, I went and just popped in to look at the rental
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.820]   unit and I instantly knew that it was going to be a good plan and that we should move.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.100]   And the reason is because when I went through the list of the priorities, the things that
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.140]   I needed in my family, I need enough space for my family to spread out, I need enough
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.780]   bedrooms for the kids, I need a washing machine.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.020]   We do cloth diapers so that requires you to have a good washing machine and dryer and
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.380]   a nice clothesline to hang the diapers on.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380]   Things like that.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.780]   I need a little bit of yard for the dogs so my wife can just throw them out of the house
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.740]   when they're boisterous instead of having to figure out how to take the whole family
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.500]   out with a stroller and go and walk them.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.580]   Just looking at that, I instantly knew it would work.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.140]   I instantly knew it was a good plan.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.860]   Took a night, thought about it.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.900]   Next day, talked to my wife about it and then I left town for Podcast Movement.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.420]   I said, "Think about it."
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.940]   We talked about it for quite a while.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.100]   We talked through some different scenarios and I said, "Let's just leave it alone until
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.060]   I get back from the Podcast Movement conference."
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:18.420]   Well, life has been tough since my baby girl was born.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:24.740]   She's had some kind of issues with her stomach and nothing medically serious, just simply
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.900]   normal new baby problems.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.940]   But it's been a real challenge working with her until we get past this, hopefully, about
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.500]   six-week phase when she's able to settle down a little bit more.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.780]   But the reason for my mentioning was that while I was gone, it was just tough on my
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:47.500]   wife as far as working with an energetic two-year-old, almost two-year-old, and a very needy little
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.900]   baby.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.380]   She had some time to think about it.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.060]   Didn't make a final decision until I got back in town.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.220]   I got back in town last week, last Tuesday, and we decided, "Yes, we'll go ahead and
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.220]   move."
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.180]   And one of the contingents of moving was I agreed to do some of the work for my brother
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.820]   who's the landlord.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.420]   I agreed to go ahead and do some of the work for him on the unit.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.340]   Fast forward, that was last Tuesday, and tomorrow, Thursday, we move.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.500]   And so it's a very quick decision.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   But it's a very quick decision because I believe that one of the most important things to do
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.740]   is when you know what you want to do and you've thought through carefully all the different
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.820]   options, when you see what you should do, move.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.220]   Act.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.900]   If you're confident and you've considered it, once you've considered the decision fully,
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.180]   don't waffle about it.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.540]   Act.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:40.700]   Act decisively.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.740]   Act quickly.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.740]   But act.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.660]   I've seen this happen with clients that I've worked with who faced financial distress.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.740]   They faced that job loss.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.660]   And instead of looking, "Take a week.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   Fine.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.700]   Consider things through.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.620]   But take a look at the budget and figure out how much money do I have and how long is it
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   going to last?
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.500]   And if I do these certain things, how much money do I have?"
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.780]   Go out and test the job market.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.460]   But if you can't—simple thing, let's talk about a house.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.140]   If you can't get a job in a week and you've got two months of runway, don't wait to list
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.660]   the house until you're behind.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.860]   List the house now knowing you can always cancel the sale.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.260]   You can always reject a contract.
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.500]   Put a high price on it.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.140]   But get an idea of what things—where things are.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.260]   Now listing the house may not be the best decision.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.260]   Maybe it's—maybe you can't find a better living situation.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.420]   But the point is act quickly.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.800]   But you can only act quickly if you've thought slowly, if you've war-gamed the scenarios,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.620]   if you've considered what your needs are, if you've been clear of what your minimum
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.180]   acceptable standards are.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:49.300]   For me, I wouldn't act quickly and move us into a one-bedroom studio apartment without
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.400]   a washing machine and without a yard.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.020]   Those are below my minimum standards at the moment.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.260]   But if you know what they are and if you can think about why you're doing what you're doing,
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.820]   then when you see the opportunity, you can move quickly.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.940]   So that's what I'm doing, moving quickly.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.060]   The final phase though is you've got to have priorities.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.460]   You've got to prioritize your life.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:16.820]   You simply can't have everything all at the same time.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:23.620]   Right now, if you haven't put in the time and the work to build the foundation, I think
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.620]   that kind of pie in the sky thinking of, "I'm just going to have it all right now without
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.740]   putting in any work," is a bunch of baloney.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.740]   It's nonsense.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:35.060]   Now, I think you can't have everything or most things over time, but you've got to put in
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.020]   the work to build the foundation to where you can accomplish your goals.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.740]   But you can't have it all at the same time.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:49.900]   Right now, everything that you want, everything perfect and ideal today, unless you've already
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.980]   today is, again, after putting in the time and the work.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:00.180]   But I think you can have what's most important to you if you know what's most important to
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.180]   you.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.340]   It's been interesting to watch people's reactions because of the quick move when I say, "Yeah,
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.580]   I'm selling my house and I'm moving Thursday," for many people came out of nowhere and it's
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.580]   like, "What's going on?
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.580]   Are you in foreclosure?
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.580]   Are you falling behind on your bills?"
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.580]   They're like, "Joshua, what are you doing?"
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.580]   "No, it's okay.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.580]   It's relaxed."
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:23.180]   But what happens is people immediately are going to filter your actions through their
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.180]   goals.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.540]   It's interesting to watch that happen because for many people, their most important goals
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.700]   are lifestyle goals, but they define lifestyle differently than the way that I do.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.940]   So for many people, buying a house is a crowning achievement.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.620]   It's a demonstration of, number one, it's a goal that they've reached after years of
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.620]   work.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.660]   It's a demonstration of their self-worth, of their journey that they've been on, and
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.620]   it's a very important process for their family.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.020]   And I don't fault those things.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.580]   If those are important for you, awesome.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   But it's not necessarily that for me.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.260]   I watch people often and I've worked with people in this.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.500]   They buy the dream house and then they spend all their time and dad and mom go off to work
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.660]   every day and they don't see their kids and they farm out their raising of their kids
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.980]   to someone that they pay and to the state.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.340]   And I look at the lifestyle and I think, "That is hell.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.140]   That is absolute hell."
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.540]   And I think, "But you're working to support this half a million dollar house and these
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   $50,000 cars."
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:42.300]   Now, your money, your life, live it how you want.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.940]   But to me, that's hell.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.700]   I'd rather live in a little apartment and have a better lifestyle, not have to go off
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.940]   every day to a job I hate.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.380]   I'd rather do work that's meaningful and important to me.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.540]   I'd rather be together with my family.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.740]   It's the reason why I married my wife.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.900]   It's the reason why I had kids.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.980]   I want to be with them.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:05.580]   I want to farm out the most important 15,000 hours of their instruction to the state.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.820]   So that requires me to set priorities.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.100]   Now, I can't have it all at the same time right now.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:18.780]   So I can't live in a million dollar house right on the water with my 43-foot yellow
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:28.900]   fin tied up to the dock and my beautiful writing studio and recording studio out back overlooking
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:36.380]   the water and with a nice $100,000 car parked in the driveway and with tens of thousands
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.140]   of dollars a month of passive income rolling in and a team of people all around the world
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.260]   who runs my business for me and I just simply do the work that I like.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.100]   I can't have all that right now.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.500]   I haven't put in the work yet.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:59.580]   But I can have some other things that I want and I can prioritize the things that I want.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:05.420]   So for me, my most important goals are lifestyle goals.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.740]   But I just define lifestyle differently than the way that other people do because what
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.780]   I can do is I can live in a rented apartment and drive a cheap car and load up my family
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:23.780]   on a random Friday morning and drive down to the beach and eat breakfast or take our
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.180]   breakfast with us or eat breakfast at a little cafe and that costs me 30 bucks, not $3,000
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.100]   a month.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.860]   I can have that lifestyle goal.
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.460]   But I can't have it all right now.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.460]   I just have to choose.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.020]   And so for me, my most important goals are those lifestyle goals.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:48.420]   And because I know those are my most important goals, I have to continue to build the financial
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:58.060]   foundation under my life to allow me in the fullness of time if I ever care to, to have
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.140]   the house on the water with a 43-foot yellowfin tied up.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:06.900]   I don't think yellowfin makes a 30 – 43 foot is probably a 37.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.180]   Let's make it a 37-foot Bahama instead.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.820]   I'm just kidding.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.060]   Point is I got to build that financial independence.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.940]   So that means at this point in time, every dollar I put into consumption is a dollar
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.820]   I can't put into investment.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.540]   Now there's a point of consumption at which I need to do.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.940]   There's a minimum level of consumption.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.780]   Again, back to my studio apartment, I'm not willing to move into a studio apartment because
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:37.380]   it's $400 a month just so that I can have extra money to invest.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.380]   That's below the minimum level of consumption for me.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:47.980]   But I don't need to buy all the consumption that I could theoretically afford right now
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.020]   and then not have any money to invest.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:58.220]   So when I combine those lifestyle goals and my financial goals which lead to lifestyle
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.820]   goals, they require massive investment.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.420]   And so in this move, I'll be freeing up – I'll go over numbers at a future date, sure, but
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.060]   I'll be freeing up a good bit of money in cash flow.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.420]   That's money that I need right now to hire help for my business.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:18.260]   $500 a month hires a full-time virtual assistant overseas.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:23.340]   And again, given the constraints that I'm at in my business with what I described earlier,
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.340]   I need help.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.820]   Well, I'm not the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.860]   I can't print money.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:36.860]   So I can free it up from consumption so that I can move it into investment.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.060]   Why do I go into so many details on this for you?
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.100]   Well, I'm doing it for a reason.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.820]   If I were a positioning consultant and I were consulting with me, I would probably tell
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.340]   myself that what I'm doing is a mistake.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.340]   The reason is because if you look at money, if you look at the way that people sell financial
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.740]   advice, the way that people sell financial advice is always from a place of having arrived.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.220]   People look back and they say, "Well, look, I've done this and I've gotten rich and here's
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.580]   my book.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.140]   Well, I haven't arrived."
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:14.740]   So I could put up the facade and this is what a lot of people do is why – I don't know
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.740]   the numbers.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   I couldn't guess.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.780]   But there are a bunch of financial advisors, mainstream financial advisors who are very
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:25.620]   rich and drive a Mercedes because it's a great car and they love to drive it.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:32.380]   And there are a bunch of financial advisors who are very broke and drive a Mercedes because
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.740]   they want you to know that they know what they're talking about and they're very broke.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.780]   You can't know.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.100]   You have no way to know.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:48.120]   So the point is that people – a positioning consultant would say, "Position yourself.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.260]   Set up your image.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.260]   Set things up."
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.260]   Well, whatever.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:57.180]   I guess I'm too much of a nonconformist to take all the advice that everyone gives.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:04.300]   But I say that I wish someone had just shared some ideas with me and then modeled those
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.260]   ideas.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.220]   I will always have the problem for those who want to result to any kind of – for those
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.980]   who want to result to an ad hominem attack against any argument that I present on radical
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.060]   personal finance or any position that I express.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.140]   I will always have the problem of my own experience and my own starting point.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:30.780]   I'm an expert on the technical side of financial planning and so I can present credentials
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.860]   and proof, certification of how much of an expert I am there.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:41.020]   And if I restricted my content on this show to that, I would never have the problem of
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.820]   being open to an ad hominem attack against what Josh Regis and I were talking about.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.860]   But because I don't restrict the content of the show there, because I talk about wealth
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.860]   building and lifestyle design and because I talk about goal setting and success, I do
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:56.300]   have that problem because I'm not a millionaire yet.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.060]   The fallacy is if people say, "Well, Joshua, you're not a millionaire yet.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.820]   So therefore you have nothing to teach."
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.300]   Well, that's not necessarily true.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.340]   Now if I'm not a millionaire in 30 years or 20 years, then maybe that would be a better
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.940]   – that would be a rational criticism.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:23.020]   But I do see some things clearly and my desire is to simply give you what I always wish existed.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.300]   I'm going to share with you some important and valuable ideas and then I'm going to
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.700]   show you what I'm doing with those ideas myself.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:35.220]   I'm not going to ask you to just take my word for it because I'm rich, take my word
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.740]   for it because I'm successful and just do it this way.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:45.280]   I'm going to try to persuade you of the rationale behind my approach and you can choose
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.500]   what you want to do with it in your own life.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.620]   But I'll demonstrate that I put my money where my mouth is and I practice what I preach.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:28:00.300]   That's what I wish existed and my hope is together we'll be looking back in 20, 30,
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.780]   40 years and this show will be sitting here as an encouragement to somebody who says,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.140]   "I wonder where Joshua Sheets started from."
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.500]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could go back and hear the thinking of – I don't know
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.220]   who's the most beloved, Richard Branson or Bill Gates or some of these.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.780]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could go back and hear what Richard Branson was doing when
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.140]   he was 30 and actually hear it in his own words?
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.100]   You can piece a little together in some articles but wouldn't that be cool?
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.000]   Because see, today everyone always talks about Richard Branson through the context of Necker
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Island.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "Oh, he's got Necker Island.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   He's got a private island.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He's got Necker Island.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He's got a private island."
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.300]   Wait a second.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:47.740]   Where were all the fans, the adoring fans when he was sleeping on a couch in a living
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:55.460]   room of a studio apartment somewhere pouring everything into Virgin Records?
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.540]   So that's the stage I'm at with Radical Personal Finance.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:07.180]   I just simply am trying to share my own journey and share some of the ideas and concepts that
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.340]   I'm learning along the way and I hope it's encouraging to you.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:15.020]   I always find it encouraging when people don't speak down to me but rather that I'm able
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.260]   to relate with the phase that they're in.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:27.180]   I'll tell you frankly, life has been tough the last few weeks, incredibly tough.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.660]   I've never been more stretched than I have been the last few weeks.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:38.080]   I've never felt more incompetent at some things than I have the last few weeks.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.260]   Many of you – some of you know.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:47.860]   Again, small kids, unhappy baby that basically needs to be held all the time to be happy.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.860]   It's tough.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:49.860]   It's challenging.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.740]   So if you're in a tough space with your progress, if you're in that stage of – you're
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.860]   the immigrant who's sleeping over their donut shop every single day to save money
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.900]   while they're building it, recognize that I'm there with you.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.420]   It's tough.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.180]   But here would be my encouragement to you and I encourage myself in it.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.180]   I see this very clearly.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.900]   It's not a made-up thing.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.740]   I don't need to psych myself up.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.300]   It's an adversity that we grow.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.860]   We have this very strange and frankly flat-out wrong concept in modern US-American culture
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.260]   that we should be searching for the easy.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.140]   I'm sick and tired of the easy, the overnight success.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.060]   I'm sick and tired of the stories about how this person went from zero to a million
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:41.740]   in no time flat because what happens is when you have that as the perspective, you have
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:47.020]   that as the goal, then you look at – and then you don't hit it because the vast majority
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.420]   of people are never going to hit that overnight success.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.820]   When you have that as the goal and have that as the perspective, then you look at your
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.860]   circumstances and you look at the reality and you think, "Oh, I'm doing something
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.860]   wrong.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:30:59.860]   There must be something wrong with me."
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.460]   There's not.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.580]   The things that are worth doing are not easy.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.580]   Behind every overnight success story is a very long road that nobody knows about.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:17.420]   I've even had to control this recently because people talked about radical personal finance.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.500]   Next month, I'm giving a talk to a local podcasting group.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:25.160]   As part of that, to establish my credentials, I'll talk about the fact that I had a million
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.460]   downloads in the first year thanks to you, the listening audience.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:36.940]   A million downloads in the first year is an extremely unusual event in a podcast's history.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.060]   Radical personal finance is at this point with our current listenership in the top 10%
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.060]   of all podcasts.
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:48.260]   We're heading as fast as we can to the top 5%.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.940]   But there's a long history that people don't know.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.460]   So what happens is someone meets you at a conference and they say, "Wow, you had all
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:58.460]   this downloads.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   You had all this listenership.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.940]   How'd you do it?"
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:07.780]   Well, they don't know about the years and years and years and years of reading, reading,
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.660]   reading, reading, studying.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.900]   They don't know about all of the week after week after week of Toastmasters meeting and
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.980]   creating speeches and sitting down and thinking about how to express ideas.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:25.220]   They don't know about the hundreds and thousands of appointments with individual clients and
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.020]   talking about finance and understanding.
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.500]   They don't know about the thousand people that I've talked to that have listened to
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.100]   their situations and I understand.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:37.380]   So when I come and talk about personal finance, it's not like I'm 21 years old and it's
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.020]   all a bunch of theory that I read in 300 finance books.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.940]   It's actually having watched people.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.100]   It's actually having listened to people.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:54.940]   When I sit down to write a show most days, it's not from the very first place of never
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:00.140]   having written an outline of what I'm going to talk about.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:07.700]   If you think at all that my pacing or tone of voice is at all engaging, it's not an accident.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.700]   It's practice.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:15.180]   If I can sit down and easily answer a financial planning question, if I can easily answer
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.420]   the technical or see the things put together, it's because I spent a whole lot of mornings
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.940]   pumping myself full of coffee at four in the morning trying to get through horrifyingly
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:29.340]   boring financial planning books.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.740]   But somehow radical personal finance is overnight success.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.340]   No, it's not.
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.020]   People don't see the 50, 60, 70 hours a week of putting together the shows.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.740]   I get comments.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.740]   It's funny.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.300]   Funniest comment, I don't remember the name, but somebody commented on my site.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.340]   If you look at radical, we've got the new website up in several months now.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.180]   One of the things on the new website is what they call in the online business, they call
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   a lead magnet.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.260]   That's the little thing that I give away to you to get you to sign up and put your email
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.260]   address in there.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:09.700]   It's supposed to be 10 top tips for your finances or Joshua's top 10 recommended personal finance
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.700]   books.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.700]   I've got to write the thing.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.260]   The problem is I can't figure out what to write and I haven't made the time to get it
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.260]   done.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.020]   I'm not excusing myself for not getting it done.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:22.420]   What's funny is that somebody commented on the show, on the show page, and they said,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:28.500]   "Boo for the spam," meaning that the idea somehow that – I can't remember the full
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:36.280]   comment but it made me laugh because the idea was that I'm spamming somebody in exchange
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:42.300]   for their email address and I'm saying, "Here's a book that's not even written."
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.500]   If the person who was commenting actually knew the real story, the real story that for
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.580]   the last two and a half months I've been needing to write the thing but every single
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.180]   time I sit down and say, "Okay, I need to make it happen," then my baby starts crying
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:57.220]   or it's time to ship another show or it's time to prepare for something else that's
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.560]   more important or it's time to figure out how to do a mastermind call for the patrons
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.580]   who actually pay me money or it's time to go and encourage my wife who's utterly exhausted
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.100]   or it's time – you get the point.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.940]   So I'm not excusing.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.660]   It kind of demonstrates my incompetence with getting it done but at the end of the day,
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.340]   you got to prioritize.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.340]   So why did I go off on that?
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:22.620]   My point in – here I am talking about experience and here I am rambling.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.580]   I'll wrap up with just this.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.920]   My point in sharing these ideas is that I'm sharing them with you for a reason.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.620]   Number one, it's cathartic for me.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.400]   Any podcaster knows it's cathartic to be able to speak into a microphone and share
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.820]   some things with your friends which is how I view you, my listening audience.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:46.060]   Number two, I want to encourage you because I'm sick and tired of the mass popular culture
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.660]   around that's obsessed with overnight results, overnight riches.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.280]   Nobody got rich overnight.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.540]   Nobody gets rich quick and stays rich.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.340]   It does not happen.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.380]   And the cool thing about that is it's incredibly freeing because once you just simply toss
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:10.180]   that out as an idea and a mindset, then you can appreciate the journey and you can recognize
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.340]   and embrace the adversity and recognize the fact that you're going to tell stories about
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:21.140]   this someday and you're going to recognize the fact that success is the progressive realization
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.700]   of a worthy ideal, that the adversity is useful.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.020]   It's shaping your character.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   It's molding you.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.020]   It's transforming you.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.940]   It's doing something in you.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.540]   And yes, we do need a period of rest but rest is not the goal.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:40.100]   Leisure is not the goal.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.580]   I'll let you figure out what the goal is.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.540]   My goals for me would come from worldview.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.740]   I won't go into that today but I will just simply say leisure and rest are not the goal.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.600]   Only in a few aspects of worldview are they.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.380]   So I just want to encourage you.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:00.980]   If you feel like you're in that process, just discard the concept of overnight excess and
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.500]   embrace the struggle, embrace the work and you'll look back and be thankful for it.
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.540]   And then here's the cool thing.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:16.180]   If you are one of those rare people who is an overnight success due to a fortunate change
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:22.580]   in circumstance, a serendipitous timing of the world and your product or whatever it
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.620]   is that you're doing, you can enjoy that but you won't be destroyed by that because many
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.660]   people have been destroyed by that.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:36.040]   When serendipity strikes and you're able to enjoy massive success, when that's placed
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:44.260]   onto a foundation and a structure and a framework of character, it won't destroy you.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.860]   But if that was the goal and you don't reach it, it'll destroy you.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.180]   And if that's the goal and you do reach it, you don't have the character, it'll destroy
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.340]   you as well.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.820]   So I guess this is motivational hour with Joshua.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.820]   Just a little bit of my story.
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.220]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.420]   I was excited to announce to you that about the move and so I just wanted to share that
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.420]   with my friends.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.660]   Looking forward to that, it gives us a good opportunity to simplify.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.060]   It's always fun to get rid of stuff and simplify.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.300]   The challenge we face in the United States of America is how to not accumulate stuff.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.940]   So much more challenging than accumulating stuff in our world.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.940]   I always feel so bad with some of the places that I've been and I always wonder who's listening
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.940]   to kind of understand that.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.580]   But it's so tough to not accumulate stuff.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.500]   So moving is a good opportunity to simplify.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.740]   As my friend John McBride says, "Live the low drag lifestyle."
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.380]   Thanks for introducing me to that phrase, John.
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.500]   Low drag lifestyle.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:40.860]   Tomorrow I will be releasing an interview with Cliff Ravenscraft.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:45.980]   This is another interview that I did while I was at a podcast movement last week.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.980]   It's an excellent interview.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.740]   It's very long but it is excellent and it's a really, really cool story of his own personal
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.740]   journey.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.740]   Cliff is a podcaster.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.940]   He hosts a show called the Podcast Answer Man among other shows as well.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:04.340]   But he's just got a great show and he has incredible candor about the process.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.660]   I love highlighting his story because it's not an overnight success story but it is a
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.660]   success story.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.260]   You'll hear that in the show.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.620]   As you'll hear in tomorrow's interview also, he's been a big encouragement to me at some
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.780]   key points throughout my own personal journey.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.780]   So check for that tomorrow.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:25.060]   If I can get my gear set up in the new place by Friday, I will do my best to get a Friday
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.740]   Q&A show shipped but don't be surprised if it doesn't show up.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:32.660]   And if I get the office set up, we'll try to be back at things again Friday if possible,
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.660]   if not, next week.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.260]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.820]   Have a beautiful day.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.100]   I was supposed to say radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
