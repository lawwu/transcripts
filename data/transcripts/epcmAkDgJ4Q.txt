[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   - Hey Brian, great to see you.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.800]   - Good to see you, Andrew.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.520]   - Brian McKenzie, world expert in human performance,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.700]   breath work, AKA respiration physiology
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.160]   and its application to things related to mental health,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.400]   physical health and performance.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700]   So if you're an athlete, a student, a parent, a teacher,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000]   or just somebody interested in the use of respiration,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800]   AKA breath work, in order to understand
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.400]   and regulate your physiology and psychology,
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.840]   the work that Brian does is absolutely first rate
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320]   and important, I believe, to know about.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.160]   Without further ado,
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160]   let's talk about the carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.260]   what it's good for and how to do it.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.760]   - Yeah, well, the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.440]   was something that we created
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.640]   kind of like it's our own little HRV, right?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.720]   - Heart rate variability.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720]   - Yeah, heart rate variability screen
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.680]   without using the technology, right?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.200]   Keeping us as the technology.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.100]   So ideally the setting is you're either lying down
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.120]   or you're sitting up.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   It's the same thing every time you do it.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.400]   You don't need to do it every single day per se,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.640]   but when you first get started with this,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   that is the best bet and doing it the same way each time.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.760]   If you don't, you're gonna be changing
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.880]   a number of the variables that could be occurring,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.320]   much like you would do with an HRV assessment
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.760]   in the morning, right?
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.200]   So ideally you're sitting or relaxed for a couple minutes.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.520]   You're either lying down or seated
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280]   at the first time you're doing it.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.040]   And then what we do after a couple of minutes
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.640]   is you would take a full inhale through the nose
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.960]   and you're going to exhale as long
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.480]   and or as slowly redundant as possible
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   through the nose only.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.320]   The reason we don't use the mouth
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.040]   is because I can purse my lips
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.680]   and I can control a lot of the variables
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.560]   that we're looking at here.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.940]   One of those variables is a mechanical issue
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.660]   that may be occurring with,
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.200]   let's say the diaphragm and intercostals
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.420]   on the eccentric control of that exhale
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.340]   and glottal control, right?
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.020]   That goes kind of out the door if I can purse my lips.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.820]   So people can actually extend this
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.820]   or prolong it with a mouth exhale versus the nose inhale,
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.540]   but you can get good at this with the nose exhale
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540]   and essentially do the same thing.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.800]   - So let me make sure I understand.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.980]   So sit down, relax, or lie down, relax.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.820]   - Couple of minutes.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.980]   - Then a big inhale.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.820]   - Full inhale.
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.660]   - Lungs full.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.420]   And then a slow controlled exhale,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.780]   what you're calling the eccentric portion of the breath
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.620]   through the nose.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.460]   - Through the nose.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.740]   - Because doing it through the mouth,
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.820]   there are just too many variables
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.700]   related to all the things you mentioned
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.120]   that can allow someone to adjust that duration.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.900]   But through the nose, it's more objective.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.740]   Is that right?
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.560]   - Correct, correct.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.140]   And obviously you're gonna have a timer with you.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.260]   So the moment that you hit the top end of your inhale,
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.800]   the timer starts and you begin to exhale.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.580]   If you're questioning the exhale at all,
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.180]   the easiest thing to do is just to cover your nostrils
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.380]   and you should feel a slight pressure
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.660]   that's still occurring due to the exhale happening.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.100]   You can cover the nostrils and there will be pressure
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.260]   and you can just remove them once you have the pressure,
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.180]   once you feel the pressure and continue to exhale.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.600]   - So before we go any further,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.560]   maybe we just try that first piece.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.400]   - Go for it.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.080]   - All right, so when it hits that five mark, I'll go.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.240]   (inhales)
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.720]   All right, all right.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.820]   - Which is actually, I mean, and your time is pretty good
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.880]   considering the fact that we're sitting here talking.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.360]   You didn't have time to relax, right?
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   That's not, I would not use this,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.680]   even though you did that right here,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.320]   that wouldn't be an accurate assessment
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   of what your morning kinda,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.800]   let's call it readiness would be, right?
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.960]   - So ideally I'd take that two minutes or so rest,
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.600]   sitting or lying down.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.880]   Okay, then do that.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.720]   The duration there for me was a little over 25 seconds
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.040]   or something on the exhale.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.920]   I noticed that when I inhale all the way,
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.240]   the temptation is to hold my breath before I start,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.840]   but you said you immediately wanna reverse into the exhale.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480]   - Yeah, you wanna start into that exhale.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.560]   - So at a very coarse level,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   if somebody has a very short exhale time,
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.960]   let's say the total duration for them
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.880]   to get to lungs empty on that exhale is 10 seconds or less,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   versus 20 to 30 seconds, versus 60 to 90 seconds.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.240]   What general sorts of information is that giving them
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.640]   about the state of their physiology?
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.720]   - That's a really good question,
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.120]   because what we've been able to uncover,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.600]   and this, you know, with the help of Andy Galpin
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080]   and his lab, for the lower scoring,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   that there is definitely a lean towards
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   more of a state anxiety.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.840]   Now, I say state for a very important reason.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.160]   This is not a diagnosis, right?
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   I am not diagnosing anxiety that is not what the,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.180]   we're talking on a scale of arousal,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.280]   my state is probably a little more anxious.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.440]   So I've probably been a little more revved up.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   You just fit into that category.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.520]   Under 30 seconds is where we start
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.280]   to fit into that category, right?
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.240]   But that would make sense for somebody
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.520]   who is more in, you know, had no practice,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.080]   no calming down effects.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.920]   - I've been drinking a little bit of caffeine.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.240]   - You've been drinking a little caffeine,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.200]   we're ramped up a bit.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.960]   Like you didn't have any, right?
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.080]   Like, so having a lower score is going to just mean
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.000]   I'm a little bit more ramped up, things going on.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.960]   - Sympathetically leaning, right?
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.560]   So I've got more sympathetic tone going on.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.320]   - Some people will hear that and they'll think sympathy.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   We're talking about the so-called sympathetic arm
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.680]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.160]   which is nerd speak for the aspect of our nervous system
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.920]   that's associated with alertness and arousal
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.480]   as opposed to parasympathetic,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.080]   which is generally associated with states of more calm,
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.960]   sleep, the so-called rest and digest system.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.400]   So we say sympathetic leaning for somebody
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.920]   who has a carbon dioxide discard rate of, you know,
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.000]   30 seconds or less, it's that they're kind of,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.240]   they're alert, they're awake.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   It doesn't necessarily mean they're having an anxiety
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.840]   or panic attack, they're just alert.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.280]   - Yeah, I mean, if you're working out,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   you're not going to exhale very long, right?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.960]   Like you've got a lot of buildup of a lot of things going on
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.240]   including your sympathetic nervous system and CO2
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.320]   because of the energy demand of what's going on.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   So that said, when we, with people who score
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.360]   under that 30 second mark, when applying this assessment,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.280]   we have them start with more basic protocols, right?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.560]   So this would just simply be more of an equal in and out,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.940]   just working that in and out based off of the scoring
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.840]   that was going on with that.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.360]   Then as we get up above 30 seconds
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.800]   and move into the 30 to 45 second range,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.080]   that gets a little bit more difficult in ranging, right?
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.200]   So what we use with rhythms starts to change.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.860]   We go to a more complex rhythm.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.980]   Ultimately, as we get up into the higher ranges
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.440]   of the exhale assessment or the--
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.160]   - So 60 seconds, 90 seconds.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   - Yeah, yeah, getting up above roughly 60, 70 seconds,
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.360]   you're going to see your apnea protocols, right?
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.520]   These are things that are more advanced protocols
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   and in fact, you would get into more
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.680]   of the breath hold work per se,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   like let's just say static apnea work.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.720]   - Okay, so carbon dioxide blow off time,
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.920]   which means it takes X number of seconds
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.840]   to go to completely lungs empty,
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.560]   the way you described before,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.600]   of 30 seconds or less is more sympathetic leaning,
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.960]   meaning more alert, maybe a little bit anxious.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.380]   35 to 45, maybe 60 seconds, calmer.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.220]   - Yep.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.040]   - 60 to 90 seconds.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.820]   - You're in your normal range around 45.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.760]   This is an absolutely normal range
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.960]   with somebody who hasn't tested, who's calm.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.440]   That is a very normal range.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.400]   - So 45 second discard rate would be a good goal for people.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.460]   - Correct.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.480]   - Okay, got it.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.120]   So if we take a step back and we just look at this test,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   what is it good for?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.280]   When could one use it?
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.840]   I know it has multiple uses.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.720]   In other words, why do this test
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.880]   in order to determine one's underlying physiology?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.080]   Is it, for instance, post-exercise as a way to determine
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.200]   whether or not you've calmed down
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.660]   and entered a recovery state?
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.820]   I know Dr. Andy Galpin's really big on this.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.440]   He talked about it on our podcast and elsewhere
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.500]   that after a hard workout,
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.440]   it's a great idea to do three to five minutes
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.120]   of down-regulation breathing, exhale-emphasized breathing,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.960]   or something to down-regulate meditation,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.440]   just something to calm down, enter the recovery phase.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.760]   I suppose one could then do
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.280]   the carbon dioxide tolerance test at the end of that
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.220]   to determine whether or not they are, in fact, calm.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.800]   Would that be one potential use?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.920]   - Yeah, you could implement it there.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.400]   The easier thing would just, knowing,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   you're gonna see a much shorter assessment.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.280]   - So people should be aware.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.480]   What about on waking?
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.360]   When people wake up first thing in the morning,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.720]   is it a good idea to do it in bed in the morning?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   - I wouldn't say in bed.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   I would say give it like 15 minutes, get out of bed,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.720]   do a few things, go to the restroom,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.840]   get some water in you, then go lie down or go sit down,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.800]   chill out for a couple of minutes, then do it.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.120]   - When else have you applied this?
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.240]   Like when you teach it to athletes, military,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.480]   CEOs, high performers, is it something to do
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.400]   before they go out on stage,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.520]   something to do mid-competition?
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.440]   What are some other applications?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.240]   - So what I do, the application I use it for
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.580]   is to identify breathing protocols
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.760]   where that individual's at.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.040]   Once we get good at this, once we have a rhythm
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.440]   and where I can see a baseline is,
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.060]   I stop doing it every day.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.120]   We then apply it maybe weekly or even monthly
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.320]   based on, I give them breathing protocols.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.080]   Based on that assessment, for the general population,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.280]   for everybody, obviously we've got rhythms
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.040]   that are associated with that and a calculator
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   that people can input to actually get those rhythms
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.840]   and to apply those rhythms for roughly three to five minutes
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.320]   whatever after they're done.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.040]   - Hey Dozer, Brian's dog Dozer has got a giant head
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.880]   and he's a beauty, goodness gracious.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.240]   He's got, his head's easily as big as Costello's.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.480]   - Oh yeah, he's-- - Okay.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.840]   So he's a nasal breather, if you notice.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.000]   He's a calm dog.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.960]   At this point, it's clear what the carbon dioxide
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.120]   tolerance test is and that the number
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.880]   that you get consistently over time,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.720]   say in the morning-- - It's important.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.680]   - Sounds like it's a good idea to do in the evening too.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.320]   - Let's apply a scientific method
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.720]   to your own world here, right?
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.120]   And this is easy for people to do
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.880]   because we've got all the information up
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.280]   that they can actually input and go,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.960]   oh, I've got a different protocol in the evening
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.800]   than I do at night, oh, and I'm also very different
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.400]   after training, so just using this assessment
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.800]   gives you an actual timeframe for what's happening
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.040]   and we've collected and had enough information
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.000]   to understand where you would fit inside of a,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.280]   you know, the schema of, hey,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.480]   whether I'm up, ramped up sympathetic
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.280]   or I'm actually more parasympathetic charged, right?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   Or down-regulated, I should say.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.640]   - Yeah, I've found the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.080]   just to be a great available anytime measure
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.200]   of internal state.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.400]   And by doing it in the morning,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.280]   and now it sounds like I should also do it in the evening,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.120]   interesting, I mean, the whole thing
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.680]   only takes three minutes total.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.720]   And you can just note the number in your mind
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.880]   or write it down, put it in your phone.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.320]   It gives you this baseline evaluation
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.880]   of sort of how you're progressing through life
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.400]   in terms of managing your internal state.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.200]   So thank you for explaining carbon dioxide tolerance test.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.040]   - Yeah.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.880]   - Give it a try, folks.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.700]   It's very informative.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.040]   It takes only about three minutes, zero cost.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:02.920]   Very easy to do.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.260]   You'll get interesting information
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.980]   about your particular physiological state at that time.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.400]   But if you do it a few times consistently,
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.240]   you'll get really interesting information.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.420]   And Brian McKenzie and colleagues have developed
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.600]   a terrific zero cost website.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.320]   It's shiftadapt.com/breathwork,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.260]   where you can take your carbon dioxide tolerance time,
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.720]   you enter it into a table there,
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.480]   and it will give you really useful information
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.600]   about certain breathwork protocols
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.120]   and how to do them specifically.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.320]   The duration of inhales, breath holds, and exhales.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.600]   Again, that's completely zero cost.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.080]   So a terrific resource.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.760]   Thank you, Brian, for providing that resource.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.780]   Shiftadapt.com/breathwork is where you can plug in
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.240]   your carbon dioxide tolerance test results
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.760]   and apply those to improve any aspects
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.640]   of your mental health, physical health, or performance
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.940]   that you're interested in.
