[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   We get many urgent and serious life situation emails in the inbox, and that includes this
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.680]   one today from a woman who wishes to remain anonymous.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.640]   "Dear Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   I am a born-again Christian.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.160]   A while back I engaged in corrupt activities at work, and this is now causing me a great
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.400]   deal of suffering.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.440]   I will be charged in court soon and then likely headed to prison.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.480]   I have since repented of my sins and prayed to God for deliverance, however my prayers
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560]   have been met with dead silence from God.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.400]   My family has also experienced so much pain and suffering, with my siblings losing their
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.000]   jobs as a result of my sin.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.620]   Here are my questions.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.560]   What encouragement can you offer me in what I face ahead, and what should a child of God
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.800]   like me do when I now face legal suffering for my crimes?
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.880]   My faith in God is intact, but I am at my lowest spiritually.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.880]   Please help me.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.420]   I have wished that God would just call me home instead of watching my family suffer
[00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.280]   through the nightmare of watching what is to come."
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:21.380]   I want to begin by pointing our about-to-be-imprisoned sister to a passage of scripture that I pray
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.720]   she will find hope-giving.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.360]   Psalm 107 has proved to be, in my life and ministry, one of the most amazingly helpful
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.680]   psalms for people in all manner of distress because it deals with such different kinds
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680]   of trouble.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.640]   Here's the section of the psalm that is so relevant for our about-to-be-imprisoned
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   friend.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.800]   And what makes it so relevant is that the affliction which these people here in this
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.440]   psalm are dealing with, this affliction came about precisely because they sinned, just
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.580]   like she did, in her illegal activities.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.880]   They sinned and now they're in her condition.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.960]   Here's what it says.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.400]   This is Psalm 107, verse 10.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:27.180]   "Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.880]   for they had rebelled against the words of God and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:43.200]   So he, he bowed their hearts down with hard labor.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.480]   They fell down with none to help.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.240]   Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.440]   He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and burst their bonds apart.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.600]   Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.280]   of man, for he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts into the bars of iron."
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.080]   Now be sure that you hear this, friend.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.840]   These are people who are imprisoned because they ought to be in prison.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.760]   They rebelled against God.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.860]   They spurned his counsel.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.600]   They broke his law.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.840]   They were found guilty, and they were put in prison where they belong.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.480]   That's why they and you right now feel, quote, "in darkness and in the shadow of death."
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.700]   Guilt is a horrible thing.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.320]   Praise God for the gospel and Jesus.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.600]   I know exactly what you mean when you say you would rather die right now rather than
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.320]   see other people suffer for your wrongs.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.840]   Of course you would.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.360]   I would too.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.960]   I have felt like that more than once in my life.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.040]   And this psalm is even more amazing.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   Verse 12 says, "It's precisely God himself who bowed their hearts down with hard labor."
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.800]   In other words, God ordained this imprisonment of his people.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.260]   He wasn't wringing his hands in heaven as though his people were being treated unjustly.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.760]   God himself was in the judgment, and he's in yours.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:45.840]   And amazingly, amazingly, these prisoners did not give way to bitterness or hopelessness
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   or self-pity.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.200]   Instead, they humbled themselves and they cried to the Lord in their trouble.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.800]   We don't know how long he left them in prison, but he did hear their cry and he delivered
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.520]   them.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.720]   And we see at least two purposes that God achieves through this.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.520]   First, their hearts were filled with overwhelming thankfulness to the Lord for his steadfast
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.800]   love that he would show them mercy even though they are guilty sinners in prison.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   And second, they magnify his power to break the bars of iron.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.100]   Now, here's one way to describe the crisis you are facing.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:41.600]   You can fixate on the providence of God as a problem, or you can take hold of the providence
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.320]   of God as your hope.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   The problem, of course, would be that God, in control of all things, could have kept
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.200]   you back from your illegal activities and spared your family all these miseries.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.120]   He could have, and he didn't.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:11.360]   You can fixate on that as a problem and become an embittered, self-pitying, angry, mean-spirited,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.280]   depressed, hopeless person.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   That would be a great tragedy, and it would be a double triumph for Satan.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.880]   He's already had one triumph.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.840]   He should not get another in your life.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.680]   Or instead of fixating on providence as a problem, you can take hold of providence as
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680]   your hope.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   That's what the people in the psalm did.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.960]   They know that God is the one who has bowed their hearts down with hard labor.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.200]   God did it.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.000]   How natural, how easy it would have been for them to turn all their affliction into anger
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.660]   at the providence of God.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.320]   But instead, they took the other path.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.880]   It's a sweet path.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.680]   I encourage you to take it.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.200]   They believed that God's power would not discipline them forever, but that his mercy
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   would return again and deliver.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.120]   This will require enormous humility and faith on your part.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.360]   But God will give it to you if you ask him and patiently wait for his timing.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.880]   Consider one more passage of Scripture to shed light on your situation.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:31.000]   Paul, the apostle, was granted the gift of having stupendous revelations from God.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.480]   God saw that such privileges could make Paul arrogant and self-exalting.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   Therefore, God appointed Satan to afflict Paul with a thorn in the flesh.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.440]   We don't know what it was, but 2 Corinthians 12.7 says, "A thorn was given to me in the
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:01.600]   flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from being conceited."
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.960]   In other words, God made Satan serve Paul's sanctification.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:15.080]   This was a kind of imprisonment for Paulâ€”imprisonment inside the suffering of a thorn.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.120]   But it wasn't an imprisonment because of sins he had committed.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.760]   It was because of sins he might commit.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:29.160]   How easy it would be for Paul to get angry at God and say, "You can't protect me
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.040]   from sinning other ways.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.880]   You don't need to use a thorn in my flesh to keep me from being proud."
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.920]   And of course, that's true.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.320]   But God is God, and we are not.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.240]   God has purposes for this.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.840]   Wise purposes.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.160]   Paul experienced the same things you did.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.280]   Namely, three times he cried out, "Deliver me, deliver me, deliver me."
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.840]   And every time God said, "No."
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:05.520]   And then come the words from Jesus to Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.640]   My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.240]   To which Paul responds miraculously, and I pray the same for you.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.880]   "Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   may rest upon me.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:30.480]   For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.780]   and calamities.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.840]   For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:41.800]   So my prayer for you, dear sister, is that you will embrace the providence of God as
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.280]   your hope.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.560]   Yes, it involves discipline for past sins.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:53.640]   And yes, it involves thorns to protect you from future sins.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:01.680]   And yes, he will break the bars of iron and bring you out, and there will be a future
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.120]   and a hope.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:10.400]   That may seem impossible now, but nothing is too hard for the Lord.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   Amen.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.320]   Thank you for those words of hope and comfort, Pastor John.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.920]   We appreciate the raw question.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.600]   We welcome all your questions.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.040]   You can send those to us online.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.400]   Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.600]   On Wednesday, we're going to look at prayer, particularly the confidence to pray.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.560]   We will only pray if we believe that God has the power to answer our prayers.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.800]   So what truth can give us confidence that God has the right and the power to answer
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.480]   our prayers?
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.600]   As you may have guessed, it's the doctrine of providence.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.480]   When we return on Wednesday, Pastor John is going to explain why God's providence gives
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.960]   us confidence to pray.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   Don't miss it.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   I'm your host Tony Reiki, and I'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.920]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor John
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   Piper.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   We'll see you Wednesday.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.280]   [END]
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   1.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   What truth can give us confidence to pray?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   Ask Pastor John.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   2.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   What truth can give us confidence to pray?
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   Ask Pastor John.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   3.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   What truth can give us confidence to pray?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   Ask Pastor John.
