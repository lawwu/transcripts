[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   I repeat, the mathematical answer is 100% determined by interest rates. If the rate of interest that you are paying on your debt is higher than the rate of interest that you can earn on your investments,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   If the rate of interest that you are paying on your debt is higher than the rate of interest that you can earn on your investments,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   If the rate of interest that you are paying on your debt is higher than the rate of interest that you can earn on your investments,

[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:55.240]   Now, on the flip side, you're investing in very low-cost investments that have a high probability of a long, over the long term, of earning a very high interest rate.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.480]   You're heavily stock-based.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.820]   You're getting a dollar-for-dollar employer match.

[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:32.420]   and you say, what about the cost of the interest of the debt?
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.460]   Is it deductible in any way?
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:36.500]   Is there any way to have some of it forgiven?
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.460]   Can I renegotiate that interest, etc.?
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.500]   It's mathematically all related to interest rates.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:38.760]   And whichever interest rate is higher, that's the one you should do.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.360]   But we need to also analyze this on at least two other factors.

[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.060]   And the key here is your personal motivation.
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.820]   Would you find it more motivating to save and invest money?
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.760]   Or would you find it more motivating to pay off debt?
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.740]   Because that motivation will cause you to do different things.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.380]   This is the most important part.
