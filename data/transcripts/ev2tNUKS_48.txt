[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Rob Smith is a pastor and theologian who lectures in systematic theology and ethics at Sydney
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.000]   Missionary and Bible College in Australia.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.960]   Rob, last time you said gender dysphoria is real.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.120]   It's the experience of real felt distress, which some people have when their psychological
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.020]   or emotional gender identity or sense of gender doesn't match up with their biological or
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.540]   birth sex.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.000]   Of course, many Christians are agnostics here.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.900]   I mean, we need to be informed so we can be careful in what we embrace and in what we
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.520]   deny.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.120]   So are there any common precipitating causes behind gender dysphoria?
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   That's again a very important question and in some ways, I guess, an obvious question
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.640]   to ask.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.860]   And I have to make clear, I'm not a medical doctor nor a psychologist.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.160]   I'm a pastor and a theologian, but I am talking with doctors and psychologists and sexologists
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.300]   and others about these issues, trying to come to grips as they are with this question of
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.660]   causation.
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.720]   And here's the perhaps disappointing answer to the question.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720]   Nobody really seems to know.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.480]   I mean, there are various theories out there, and in some cases, it may be easier to determine
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.540]   what the causes are for this particular person or that particular person.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.780]   But in general, it's something of a mystery.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.080]   Now having said that, I guess the general answers or at least ways of trying to think
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.260]   through an answer are simple enough.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.300]   Is it nature?
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.060]   Is it nurture?
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.460]   Or is it some combination of the two?
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.440]   Is it determined by our heredity and biology or is it determined by our environment and
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.720]   experience or is it some interaction?
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.660]   And certainly, there have been people who've tried to, I guess, discover some sort of biological
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.160]   cause or nature component.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.560]   And there are different theories that you can perhaps, anyone can read about if they
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   are researching on this, prenatal hormone theories, for example, or brain difference
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   theories.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   But the bottom line is none of these theories are, well, certainly not clearly supported
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.680]   by the evidence to date.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:36.560]   So that's not to say that there can't be some sort of biological contribution to these things.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   But it's certainly not clear and it's certainly not determinative.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.600]   So that suggests, I think, that the cause lies more obviously in the realm of, again,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.120]   nurture or environment.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.240]   But of course, there's often an interaction between these two things, between nature and
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.120]   nurture as most psychologists now recognize that you can't really separate out sort of
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   heredity and environment.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.120]   One person's written biology interacts with both cultural context and personal choice.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.240]   And so, it's the old chicken and egg.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.360]   These things impact one another.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.160]   But I think, again, I think it's fairly clear that the major contributors have got to mind
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.840]   the area of environment.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.680]   Well, what here, and again, this is where I think it becomes very case specific.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.640]   I guess for all children born into this world, there is a process of social labeling and
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:50.200]   differential treatment that goes on as people react to, it's a boy, it's a girl, and therefore
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   dress them a certain way, give them certain gifts, and just interact on the basis of that.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.320]   But of course, children can pick up mixed signals and develop confused perceptions of
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.960]   gender roles and can make assumptions.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.720]   If they like a certain thing, does that mean I'm not like the other girls or not like the
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   other boys?
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:26.840]   And then there can be issues of gender envy or even gender idolization, I think, would
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.960]   be a way of talking about it.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.580]   And so, all of those things can go on for a person.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.320]   And then there's also some other, what do you call them, medical psychological conditions,
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   like for example, Asperger's syndrome.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.840]   There's a very high correlation between girls with Asperger's syndrome and their experience
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.000]   of gender dysphoria, which sort of makes sense.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.440]   If one of the, I guess, features of Asperger's syndrome is difficulty connecting with your
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.480]   sort of social context and reading social cues and interacting straightforwardly, then
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   it sort of makes sense you might then also be confused about who you are and where you
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.520]   fit into the matrix of things.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.760]   So again, I wish I had simpler answers, but I think that's sort of the best perhaps we
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   can say at this point.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   >>Corey: No, not simple at all.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.840]   That point alone, I think, is really good for Christians to hear, though.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.000]   It's complex.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And so, I think it forces the question then of how deep is our biological gender coded
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.040]   into us individually?
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.440]   Can we say our souls are engendered?
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.960]   Does the biological me reveal the true me?
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.600]   How would you go about explaining that?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.280]   >>John: Yeah, well, now we're moving into the realm of theology and philosophy.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.960]   And again, it probably won't surprise you that it's a contested field here, and there
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   are different thoughts and different answers that people will give.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.240]   My view is that as human beings, God has given us a distinct body and soul, but they exist
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.760]   in what some theologians like to call psychosomatic unity.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.800]   And so there's an integration there or an interaction there.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.200]   Again, some philosophers talk about this as dualistic interactionism.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   So that it's therefore not possible to sort of have a body of one kind and a soul of another.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.440]   The two are knit together.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.080]   Psalm 139, "You knit me together in my mother's womb."
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.800]   Not just knit my body together.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.720]   The two are given by God.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.480]   Now, again, one of the interesting questions within that is, okay, well, does, as it were,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.440]   our biology determine our personality, or does it simply reveal the person that God
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.440]   has made?
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.360]   Well, I don't know that we really have to answer that question, because the end point
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.360]   is the same.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.480]   There's a congruence.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:19.080]   We have sex bodies, and we are gendered persons, and our sex both reveals and in large measure
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.800]   determines our gender.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.400]   So that's certainly my view.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   Again, if you trace back the sort of history of Christian discussion on this, you've got
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.080]   people like Thomas Aquinas, I think, who thinks that souls are sexless or genderless, and
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.520]   it's only bodies that have gender, and others who therefore speculate that in the eschaton,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:46.240]   we'll all be sort of asexual and that sort of thing.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.360]   My reading of Scripture is, no, no, the resurrection of the body is, whilst it'll be a transformed
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.280]   version of this body, it will be a version of this body.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:04.760]   And therefore, we should expect that we will be sexed and gendered in the world to come,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.520]   even though, as Jesus says, that there will be no continuance of marriage and other things.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.000]   So again, some of those things we'll have to wait and see, of course, when we watch
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.360]   this space thing.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:22.280]   But the simple answer, I guess, to the question is, yeah, no, I think our bodies and souls
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.600]   are designed by God to speak to one another.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:33.000]   We have male or female sex, and masculine or feminine, and gender as a consequence.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.360]   Yeah, that's helpful, and it honors Scripture as well.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   Thank you, Rob.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.880]   Rob will be with us all week, and next up is the question, "Why is transgender such
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.760]   a big deal for us Christians?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.360]   Why are we talking about it on this podcast?
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   Why not let people do with their bodies whatever they want to do?
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.360]   They're not hurting anyone else."
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.760]   We hear that all the time, and it's the next question I have for tomorrow.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.360]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with guest Rob Smith from Sydney,
