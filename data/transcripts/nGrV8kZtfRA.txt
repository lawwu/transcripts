[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.500]   Um, let's move on here.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.200]   Alex, Alex asks, what's the best way to meet other deep workers?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.260]   I'm a freelance writer.
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.060]   I make a living doing deep work.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.680]   I love to meet regularly with other people who prioritize deep work to
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.700]   compare notes, discuss goals, et cetera.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.000]   But I do not know where to find other people like this.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460]   Alex, that's a good question.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.960]   I don't, I mean, I've been thinking about, I don't have an answer, first of all,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.680]   I don't have a great answer for you, but it gets me brainstorming.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.660]   Maybe we should, we should be involved in finding a better
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.040]   way of helping people do this.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.400]   Like, I don't know, Jesse, what do you think about what would be good here?
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.160]   Like, I, let me tell you like a model that's interesting to me.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.320]   Uh, Mr.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.640]   Money Mustache, Pete Adney.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.520]   I was thinking, are you thinking about it?
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.760]   Right.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.640]   You're going to, I had a feeling you're going to mention that.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.940]   So Justin and I have talked about this, but so, so, uh, Mr.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.560]   Money Mustache, who, who, um, blurb digital minimalism.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.840]   So I met him when I was working on that book.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   He's a personal finance guy, uh, made a bunch of money with
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.920]   his personal finance website.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.900]   He lives in Longmont, Colorado, and he bought just a building
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.640]   downtown in Longmont and, uh, they renovated it.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.160]   And it's basically like a coworking space, but it's like a coworking space,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.400]   but it's also a gym, like an outdoor gym.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.640]   And, uh, they have a lot of kegs there for these like evening talks.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.040]   So they bring in people to talk about, I guess, business and stuff like this.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.200]   And they have talks and they, and, uh, craft brewers in the neighborhood
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000]   bring in kegs of beer, it's just created this whole physically located,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.840]   physically cited community about, in this case, people who believe in his
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.240]   sort of whatever it says, financial, financial, uh, advice type philosophy.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.720]   But like, should there be something like this for deep work?
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480]   I think people pay a small fee to go to this thing, like $50 a month or
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.920]   something like that, like some small application, you gotta live in the area.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.040]   Um, yeah.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   But like coworking space, that's like deep work focused.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.960]   Not a bad idea, actually.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.760]   And if we had a building here in Tacoma park where you could come in and I don't
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.200]   know what would make it deep work focused.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.480]   I think I would probably pulling from the Unimodium machine, there'd be
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720]   the common space and then pods.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.160]   Like you go into these pods to do deep work.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.400]   It's not even like, oh, here's my office.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.480]   No, you're you're that stuff can be out in the common space.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   You go into these pods to do deep work.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.760]   And then there's like kind of a more social space.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.920]   And then like another space is just for, I don't know.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.680]   I don't know exactly how it would work, but, uh, that would be cool.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.560]   That'd be cool.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.640]   I could something you could see happening more commonly across the country.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.440]   So, so Alex, I'm just using this as a chance to brainstorm, but I think.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.760]   You know, there's like a deep work meets.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.120]   We work play here.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.240]   That could be cool at a smaller scale, Jesse, like, should we do
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   an event you think at some point?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.320]   You had mentioned this early on in your podcast and yeah, I got lazy.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.480]   I was like, oh, I'll definitely go to that.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   This is before I even, you know, started working here, but then, so I was
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.280]   definitely going to go whenever you announced it.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.600]   Like that could be fun.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   I mean, it seems like a pain.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.000]   That's why I didn't do it because I had no time, but if we had
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.720]   some help, it could be interesting.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.040]   We have, I don't know where we would do it.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.760]   If we would do it here in Tacoma park or do it somewhere where we had more room.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.440]   I just have a lot of people in the DC area who are into this stuff.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.600]   Like let's all get together and just like go down near a Nats game.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   Go down near a Nats game.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   Do it in the dugout.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.160]   It'd be awesome.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.440]   But yeah, we could do it down there.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.120]   We could do it here at the restaurant that the Deep Work HQ is over.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.520]   I mean, I don't know how much space we have here.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080]   I don't even know how many people would come.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   That's probably a lot.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.760]   My only, I'm trying to think my only benchmarks.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.000]   I've done some, some book signings here in DC that were pretty popular.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.360]   I did one for digital minimalism at Politics and Prose and we definitely
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.640]   standy roomed only that place.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.600]   And then when Scott Young was here, we did a joint one down on eight street
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.800]   at a bookstore down there and we definitely, you know, standy room only
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.320]   that place, so I don't know, we might get a, we might get a good crowd.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.880]   It's kind of hard to tell.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.720]   Um, I let's think about that.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.560]   Cause I haven't seen people.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.880]   I mean, I see people now I do speak in events again and stuff like that.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.360]   So I do see people, but that might be kind of cool.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.040]   We get together like a lot of deep life, deep work, deep questions, type people.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.920]   We all get together and just meet people can meet each other.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.200]   Like, Hey, here's some other people that, you know, people, people, people,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.240]   people, yeah, deep people with some people, people, the problem is I'm like
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.280]   an introverted curmudgeon who is a myth and throw up and say, I don't want to,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.920]   I don't want to bother like talking to people.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.880]   Sometimes I'm in that mood.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   And then other times, like I want to meet all my listeners and readers, and it
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.160]   just depends on like my mood for the day.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.560]   Oh, well.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   So Alex, we're working on it.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.400]   All right.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.920]   That's the, that's the long and the short of it.
