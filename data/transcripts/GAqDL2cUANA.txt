[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   Oh, well, okay, let's do one more.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.400]   All right.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.360]   Final question is from Amy.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.240]   She asked, how can I reset my ambitions after burning out?
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.300]   She's talking about how she's overwhelmed with her career, and she's trying to improve
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.040]   at that and she's fresh off of burnout and is lost on where to start.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   It's a good question, because I don't think we, we don't get into this enough.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.080]   Burnout and the sources of burnout, we don't get into that enough when we talk about optimistic,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.640]   forward-looking discussions of productivity and planning, organization, et cetera.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.200]   So let's, let's be clear here.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   You need to do, you know, your lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520]   That's the theme of this episode.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   Lifestyle-centric career planning is a great way.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   It's a theme of block two, at least.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   Know your vision, work backwards to figure out what to do with your career.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.140]   Here's the key.
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.360]   Keep the sources of your burnout in mind when you construct that vision.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.600]   It should be your vision of an ideal life should keep in mind the things that really
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.360]   tax you, the things that tend to accumulate and lead to burnout.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.740]   Your ideal life should be a life in which you're free from burnout.
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520]   That has to be part of the vision.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.920]   I think too often what people do is they invalidate the burnout and the things that lead to burnout.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.220]   Like that's malformed and successful people don't have that.
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.940]   And so my vision of what I'm trying to do with my life has to be one that ignores that.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.780]   And it might be a vision that has all of the stressors, all of the anxiety triggers, all
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.500]   of the things that really don't match well with you and lead to burnout in it.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   And that's not going to work.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.620]   So build an ideal vision of a life should be a life without burnout, which means the
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.540]   things that cause the burnout should be largely absent from it.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.540]   I do this.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.580]   I do this with my own planning, my vision with which I think about my life because my
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.380]   body has this really clear, I talk about this a bunch on the show.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.140]   It has this really clear feedback mechanism on don't like where you're going, the workload,
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.580]   the type of work and it's insomnia.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.420]   I have trouble sleeping when things get out of whack.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.180]   That feedback mechanism, and that's my burnout.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.620]   And that feedback mechanism has a huge impact on the vision of my life that I build.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.580]   I steer away from visions, especially the professional part of my life that are getting
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.380]   after it busy where it's a startup and it's like, let's go and we're going to just get
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.300]   after it and have all these different things going on and calls and meetings and we're
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.300]   going to move and we're going to build this thing big and make $20 million off of it.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.380]   I have to steer away from that because if I have too much going on and then I might
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.300]   start getting insomnia, it'd be very hard to keep up those hard schedules.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.300]   It's a governor.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.460]   So my vision doesn't involve that.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.340]   Think about the visions that you see playing out of my own life.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.140]   They're all slow productivity related.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.340]   It's all based on things that no particular single day matters.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.340]   What matters is that over time, you're coming back again and again to work on this book.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.140]   Over time, you're thinking deep thoughts.
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.580]   Hey, tomorrow, if you're tired, who cares?
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.260]   But this month, you spent a lot of days thinking about this paper.
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.820]   You spent a lot of days working on this book.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.800]   So I've constructed ideal vision that keeps explicitly in mind the specific things that
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.460]   lead to my sources of burnout, my particular definition of burnout.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.420]   I think that's really important.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.180]   If you get drained when you're not feeding off other people, you're very social, your
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.180]   family and friends are important, you better have a vision of your life in which you're
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.020]   not working 80 hours a week.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.300]   It's got to be a vision of your life where you live near family, where you spend a lot
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.900]   of time with community and friends.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.980]   I'm going to give a specific example here.
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.380]   There's a writer whose book I read, and I feel bad because I forgot the name of it.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.620]   I think it's Donald Miller is his name.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.900]   He had a self-help advice book.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.740]   But anyways, the thing that I remember from that book is they bought a bunch of land outside
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.340]   of Nashville and built it.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.820]   They wanted to be like a retreat center and a place where writers and musicians and artists
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.980]   they know could always be coming through and having retreats and working.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.620]   They could be outside a lot, work on the land a lot, have a lot of people they found really
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.620]   interesting there.
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.740]   It was a vision of success for this person in the world of business that really focused
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.220]   on what he needed.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.820]   Probably this would be someone where 90 hours in their office at McKinsey, where you're
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.580]   not seeing anybody and you're just cut off and you and your spreadsheet would be immiserating.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.980]   Your vision is what I'm trying to say here, has to keep your sources of burnout in mind
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.700]   because your vision needs to be one in which burnout is infrequent and unexpected when
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   it does happen.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.860]   I mean, so update your vision and it might require radical change.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.980]   If the source of your burnout is going to be unavoidable, you're in an academic department
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.900]   where there's acrimony through the roof and it just stresses you out and you can't get
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.460]   more than a semester or two without just it wearing you down, you might have to do something
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.640]   radically different.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.980]   You need a vision of your life in which that doesn't happen.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.180]   I want to validate your burnout and say, use that in your planning.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180]   [MUSIC]
