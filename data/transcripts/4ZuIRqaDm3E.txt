[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Hello everyone, it's Good Friday today, but we are making our way quickly to Easter, my
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.840]   favorite holiday of the entire year.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.640]   So why do we celebrate Easter to begin with?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.760]   It's a great question that takes us back to the very roots of our confession and to the
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.040]   very basis of our faith.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.200]   The question arrived recently in the inbox.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.120]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is William.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.040]   I'm a 15 year old new believer of about 7 months.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.320]   Your podcast has been a wonderful help for my journey of faith and I thank God for your
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.520]   online ministry.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.160]   Truly the Lord has blessed me through the wisdom he has given you."
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.040]   My question is this, what is the importance of Jesus' resurrection?
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.140]   Since Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins, why does it matter that he rose again?
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.440]   Is it essential for salvation to believe so?
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.980]   I've heard people deny that he physically resurrected, saying he only spiritually resurrected.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.080]   What difference, Pastor John, would this make?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.920]   It's a great question and there are great answers in the Bible.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.540]   This is not a hard question to deal with because the resurrection is the greatest event, along
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.520]   with the death of Jesus in the universe.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   It is greater than any galactic event that may embrace light years of distance and brightness,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.280]   a million times greater than our sun.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.160]   The resurrection of Christ is greater.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.360]   So before I give three reasons from the New Testament that the resurrection is essential
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.680]   to God's purposes in creation and salvation, let me just say clearly, affirming the bodily
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.920]   resurrection of Jesus is essential to being a Christian.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.520]   Paul says in Romans 10:9, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.960]   in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you'll be saved."
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.240]   Now I know Acts 16:31, it says this, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved."
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.440]   But when he said that, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved," he did not mean
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.480]   believe on a dead man.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.600]   When he said, "Believe on the Lord," he meant he's Lord.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   He's Lord.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.640]   You can't read Paul's letters and think, "He was Lord and now he's in the grave."
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:41.120]   He said in 1 Corinthians 12:3, "No one can say Jesus is Lord, is Lord, except by the
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120]   Holy Spirit.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.600]   He is Lord."
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.120]   You can't be a Christian if you only believe in a dead human being who was Lord.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   You can't.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.840]   He is Lord, and Jesus is Lord, is the fundamental early church confession.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.620]   So here are three reasons why the resurrection and consequently Easter is so important.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.080]   It's important because of, one, the connection between Christ's resurrection and his death.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.800]   Two, it's important because of the connection between Christ's resurrection and our resurrection.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.740]   And three, it's important because of the connection between Christ's resurrection and his present
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.240]   and future ministry.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.620]   Let's take this one at a time briefly.
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.240]   The connection between Christ's resurrection and his death.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.520]   Consider two key passages, Romans 4.25.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:46.000]   Christ was delivered up to death on account of our trespasses and raised on account of
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.760]   our justification.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   That means that the resurrection was God's sovereign act to emblazon the triumph of Christ's
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.060]   death across the universe.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.480]   The death of Christ successfully completed the foundational work of our justification.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.280]   Nobody would be saved without God's declaring us just and righteous before his throne of
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   justice.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:28.680]   And Romans 4.25 says that the death of Christ so completely and successfully secures this
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:37.320]   justification that God put his omnipotent stamp of approval on it by raising Jesus from
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.400]   the dead.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.680]   The bodily resurrection of Jesus vindicated the saving success of the bloody death of
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   Jesus.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.580]   And here's the other text, 1 Corinthians 15.14-18.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.220]   If Christ has not been raised—and he's talking bodily resurrection here because you
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.220]   can see that in the rest of the chapter—if he's not been raised, then our preaching
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.420]   is in vain and your faith is in vain.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.240]   If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.340]   You are still in your sins.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   Now get that because Jesus died to remove the guilt of our sins, and Paul is saying
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.000]   if he's not raised, you're still in your sins.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.300]   Then those also who have fallen asleep have perished.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:36.180]   In other words, Paul's preaching of the cross—cross, death—is pointless if Christ
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.140]   was not raised from the dead.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.440]   Futile, he says.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.180]   And we know it means bodily resurrection because the rest of 1 Corinthians 15 makes that clear.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.440]   That's the kind of resurrection he's talking about.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.400]   You are still in your sins.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.840]   They are not forgiven.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   The blood of Jesus is powerless, useless, a failure.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.500]   It aborted if Christ was not raised from the dead.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   Verse 20.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.880]   In fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.480]   So the resurrection is important because of its connection to the death of Christ.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.400]   Number two, the resurrection is important because of its connection between Christ's
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.420]   resurrection and our resurrection.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.980]   First Corinthians 15.20.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.980]   Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.820]   That means the resurrection is viewed as a one great harvest, and Christ's resurrection
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.720]   is the first fruits, the first stage of the resurrection that guarantees our resurrection.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.680]   Or Romans 6.5.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.580]   If we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.860]   him in a resurrection like his.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.840]   Our resurrection will be owing to our union with Christ who was raised.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.900]   If he wasn't, we won't be.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:12.920]   Or 2 Corinthians 4.14.He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.660]   So Christ's resurrection is important because ours depends on his.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.080]   If he wasn't, we won't be.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.920]   Finally, number three, the resurrection of Christ is important because of the connection
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.360]   between Christ's resurrection and his present and future ministry.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.160]   The death of Christ was the purchase of our salvation, not the application or consummation
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.360]   of it.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.480]   The Bible describes much more to be done for our everlasting enjoyment of the glory of
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.160]   God and the fellowship of Jesus.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:08:00.360]   His saving work goes on in his resurrection body as he intercedes for us and when he comes
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.260]   again in glory to establish his kingdom.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:12.960]   The goal of our eternal life is to enjoy and magnify the living Christ as he rules over
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.360]   his church and gives himself in service and fellowship to his bride.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.680]   It is a salvation of living fellowship.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.640]   If he weren't alive, we wouldn't have any salvation.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.960]   There would be nothing to enjoy forever and ever that is supremely satisfying.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.760]   So no resurrection, no fellowship, no salvation, no joy.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.520]   So consider these texts.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.180]   Romans 6.9.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.960]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.920]   Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.600]   Romans 8.34.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.120]   Who is to condemn us?
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.320]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.600]   More than that, that's really important.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:06.040]   More than that, who was raised, indeed, who is at the right hand of God, who is interceding
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.840]   for us.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.760]   Ephesians 1.20.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.360]   God raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.940]   far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, above all names that are named.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:30.160]   He put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.400]   which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.600]   That's his present ministry today as all-supplying guide and head for the church.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.560]   Acts 17.31.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.920]   God has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.920]   has appointed.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   So judgment is coming.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.120]   Jesus is going to be the man who does the judgment.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   And of this, he has given assurance by raising him from the dead.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.240]   And finally, Colossians 1.18.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:12.020]   He is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.520]   So the resurrection of Jesus is all-important because his death would be ineffective without
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:26.680]   it and because we would have no hope of resurrection without it and because the ministry of Jesus
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:34.260]   that he is performing right now and will perform forever for our everlasting joy would not
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.520]   exist without the resurrection.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:46.880]   Together with the death of Jesus, his resurrection is the all-important event in the history
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.940]   of the world.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.200]   No overstatement there.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   Amen.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.280]   May we celebrate his death and resurrection this weekend in particular.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.840]   And on behalf of Pastor John and the entire team at DesiringGod.org, we're praying that
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:09.400]   you would have a wonderful, incredible weekend reflecting on the implications of Jesus' cross
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.360]   and his resurrection.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.040]   Everything for us, everything for us hinges on these precious realities.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.720]   Have a great celebration weekend.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.760]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   Amen.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   Amen.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.280]   Amen.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   Amen.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
