[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.140]   - This guy did such a great job.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.140]   - This is insane.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.480]   - This is really incredible actually.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840]   - I don't agree with everything you say guys.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.320]   I do learn something new every time.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.160]   - It's a good compromise.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.280]   You guys are gonna look like a winner.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.560]   - I can't brainstorm this right now
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   'cause I've had three glasses of tequila and two beers.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   But I will tell you,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   I think that the best thing
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.280]   that we can do is have the conversation.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.120]   - Of course.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.240]   - And I appreciate you doing that.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.680]   - Really too slumpy, honestly.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   - Well, you can open the top button and flip this up.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.480]   - Here, let me see.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.600]   - You have a nice watch on?
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.640]   - No, not like you.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.480]   Just let me borrow your watch for the day
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.240]   and you don't wear a watch.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.080]   - Yeah, you want it?
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.920]   - No.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.800]   - Does it look better, you think, tucked in?
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   Jim wants a call.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.160]   - Yeah.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.080]   - Is it allowed to sit on your belt?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.240]   - This looks better.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.480]   It looks less like you.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.560]   - Stacks, we're about to start.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.440]   If you have any pull on this guy,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.600]   please get him sooner.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.440]   - Hello.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.760]   - He's not showing up until 9.59.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.600]   - I know.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.440]   - I told you this.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.280]   - Yes.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.100]   - He's barely gonna show up.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.940]   - I'm sorry, he says.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.760]   Okay, great.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.600]   - Doubt it.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   Can we get him, Mike?
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.040]   - He's going to show up at the absolute last minute.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.880]   - 9.45.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.720]   - He did it again last year.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.540]   - Same thing?
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.380]   - Yeah.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.880]   - We will explain how we upstage in two minutes.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.720]   - Yeah.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.540]   - All right, will you be ready?
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.380]   - Yeah.
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.200]   - Okay, perfect.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.040]   Thank you.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.440]   - There he is.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.280]   - Hey, brothers.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.120]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.940]   - I didn't come any earlier.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.400]   - Stacks is here, your man.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.800]   Oh, 9.59, you just got here.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.700]   - Guys, we're running a tight shift.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.540]   - Let's get it ready.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.740]   Come on, guys, you ready?
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.580]   Let's do it.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.400]   - Stacks.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.240]   - Give me that energy.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.060]   - Wish not.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.660]   - And now, give it up for your besties.
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.560]   - Welcome to LA.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940]   - Anybody fly in over 10 hours to get here.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.460]   - If Jason hadn't stolen all the money,
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.200]   we could have given you guys something to eat.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.440]   (laughing)
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.280]   - Don't worry, guys, I'll take care of the parties.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.480]   - Unbelievable.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.840]   - Pretty great.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.880]   - Make sure you get your empty lunch bag
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.240]   when you walk outside, guys.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.400]   (laughing)
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.880]   - So, first off, please join me
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.160]   in welcoming Ray Dalio to the stage.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.000]   - Wow.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.200]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.620]   We got Ray Dalio.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.560]   - I think the basic picture in China,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.600]   the United States, the emergence of India, and so on,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.060]   is the world order's gonna change in a very profound way.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.360]   - When a rapidly rising power seriously threatens
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.520]   to displace a ruling power, shit happens.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.840]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.040]   - 25 years from now, I think the need to work will disappear.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.740]   AI will cause great abundance,
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.520]   but meaning for human beings
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.840]   will be the largest problem we face.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.000]   - I think we're at an incredible inflection point,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.160]   and we all need to be open-minded
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   and understand that, like, the train has left the station.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.440]   - So, it's like, we are, at every moment,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.800]   we are made of different atoms of space,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.500]   yet we believe that it's the same us
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.320]   at every successive moment.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.720]   I think AI is sort of,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.120]   AI is very limited in the computational universe.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.160]   The computational universe is all these possible rules.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.080]   We're gonna talk about whether the,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.040]   I hope we're gonna talk about
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   whether the physical universe--
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.700]   - We are gonna talk about the universe
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.540]   and the nature of the universe,
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.880]   which is, we're gonna talk about consciousness,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.700]   and we're gonna smoke weed,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.540]   and then we're gonna go to lunch, but.
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.760]   (laughing)
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.340]   (gentle music)
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.840]   - So, that's like the number one thing.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.320]   I want it, this Thai beef salad is the number one thing
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.160]   in LA.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.320]   Do you want the Thai beef salad?
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.300]   - Yeah, whatever you recommend.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.140]   Thank you, sir.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.240]   - I can have another Thai beef salad.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.080]   - Hey, is it important?
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.160]   What do you recommend?
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.360]   - The Thai beef salad.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.760]   - Fuck, this is great, look at this.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400]   Wow.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   - I swear to God, when you meet the guys in the audience,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.240]   that's what's amazing.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   They're like fucking real grinders.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.280]   They're like all business people.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.380]   They've all done something.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.640]   They've all taken risks.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.060]   It's really inspiring.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.640]   (gentle music)
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.400]   (dramatic music)
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:58.960]   - The fusion reaction,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.400]   the reaction that happens inside all the stars,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   it's actually the most prevalent reaction
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.700]   in the entire universe.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.540]   What we're trying to do
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.700]   is we're trying to take that reaction
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.680]   and put it in a bottle,
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   in a machine that we can build here,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.200]   and that we can build quickly.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.560]   - Is there pressure to tone down
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.680]   like the consumerism or the giving away money?
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.800]   - No, not really, to be honest.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.000]   Most people think it's cool
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.960]   'cause it's like, it's kind of fun to watch
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.800]   someone receive $10,000 or a Lamborghini or a house.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.600]   Like the last thing we did was I ordered pizza
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.880]   and tipped the guy a house.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.800]   And like, I thought that was cool.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.240]   - We've got a great party for you tonight.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.480]   Obviously, Santa Monica Pier.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.560]   It's gonna be a little crazy, so get there early.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.360]   - Barbie party is this way, welcome to.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:01.080]   (scatting)
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.640]   - So I'll be talking about engineering viruses
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.580]   to go after brain cancer.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.400]   (scatting)
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:38.800]   (scatting)
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:07:03.060]   - You guys are probably gonna be--
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.900]   - Nikki or Nicole?
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.700]   - You're saying Nikki, Nikki.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.740]   - I've called her Nikki in the past,
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.220]   but I can't remember if I'm fucking that up.
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.060]   - Nikki, unless I text you, I will ask her.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.780]   - Do not put this in the fucking video.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.580]   Only make him look good, only.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.140]   No authenticity whatsoever.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.480]   We don't want any authenticity in this video.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.300]   - How many of you are short on sleep?
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.180]   Every one of you, raise your hands, come on.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.200]   So there is a rare mutation that happens in patients,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.740]   these are people walking amongst us,
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.580]   who have a mutation in a gene called DEC2.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.860]   These patients only need four hours of sleep a night
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.180]   to be completely rested the same way that we have
[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.300]   the need for eight to nine hours of sleep a night.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.340]   Are you interested in getting this gene therapy?
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.340]   We could do this today.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.380]   - The reason I picked this title is Silicon Valley's
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.580]   2,851 miles away from Washington,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.500]   and as these people put their eyes towards us,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.260]   I would state the following.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.880]   The reason Silicon Valley's been so successful
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.320]   is because it's so fucking far away from Washington, D.C.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.980]   (audience applauding)
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.820]   Thank you.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.180]   - Luxury beliefs have, to a large extent,
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.580]   replaced luxury goods.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.740]   A core feature of a luxury belief is that the believer
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.900]   is comfortably insulated from the consequences
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.220]   of his or her belief.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.980]   - Jenny, thanks so much for joining us here
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.180]   at the awarding conference.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.020]   - Thank you.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.940]   (audience applauding)
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.580]   - I didn't realize there's so many skills
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.620]   that men are learning at a very young age
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.860]   that women are not.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.340]   They're learning strategy,
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.940]   they're learning capital allocation,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.340]   they're learning just how to take risks,
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.380]   fail, and get back in the game.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.100]   I've been playing poker as a business person
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.820]   my whole life, I just didn't know it.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.480]   (hip hop music)

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.040]   - We don't need Sax, he's not gonna
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.760]   add anything to the side shit.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   Fuck Sax, let him sleep.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.840]   Get him some fuckin' coffee.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.040]   I mean, for real.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.200]   He was out last night with Drake, I think.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.320]   Oh, look, look what the cat dragged in.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.560]   Oh.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.720]   - Yeah, I was busy last night writing an op-ed.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.560]   What did you do?
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.720]   - Oh, oh, it's 9.59, I can set my watch.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   - I read it.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.400]   - I didn't see it.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.560]   Who'd you write it for?
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.400]   - Elon.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:59.520]   - There's an article in Today's New Yorker
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.160]   calling you a super villain,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.680]   because you're advocating peace
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.960]   and protecting the First Amendment.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.160]   I mean, it's like completely upside down.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.040]   - Do you want people to eat their vegetables?
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.640]   - At this point, you literally cannot sell
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.880]   actual press from parody.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.160]   - This session is like my fucking nightmare,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   because I'm so frustrated with Chess, I gotta be honest.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.760]   Just sitting here and getting embarrassed
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.560]   in front of everyone and putting it on the fuckin' internet,
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.400]   it's like.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.720]   - Okay, check.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.560]   - What?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.640]   The fuck?
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.000]   - I can't focus on you anymore.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.320]   - Oh, Jesus Christ, you're such an asshole.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.480]   God, this is like fuckin' 20 years
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.680]   of our friendship right there.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.280]   That's exactly.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.920]   - You know, let's have term limits
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.560]   for members of Congress and Senators.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.600]   Let's not have any corporate PAC money,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.120]   or any PAC money, any lobbyists.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.560]   And also, ban members of Congress from becoming lobbyists.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.400]   This was common sense things.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.920]   - I mean, listen, I think this is the most
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.880]   eclectic and interesting group of speakers
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.520]   that any conference of the year pulls together.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.440]   Yeah, we have problems in the world.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.120]   Graham will say, "Destined for war."
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.960]   Ray Dalio will say, "Fall of an empire."
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.520]   Well, part of what they're doing is sending us a warning.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.600]   But the great thing about America,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.240]   like, we have agency.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.920]   We get together every week and we have this conversation
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.360]   because we actually think you can do something
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.600]   about these things, right?
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   And talking about it is critical
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.840]   to doing something about these things.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.880]   I'm hitting the head.

[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:44.640]   - He looks like fucking Blade Runner.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.960]   That's awesome.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.240]   (dramatic music)
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.440]   - Rock and roll, baby.
