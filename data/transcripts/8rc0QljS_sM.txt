[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   I've been at a loss of words, but not at a loss of thoughts and memories when I learned that my
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.040]   grandmother passed away several days ago. I thought I would try to use this microphone,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:34.080]   use this podcast to try to find the words to honor the woman who's responsible for much of who I am,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.840]   who taught me, silly might be to say, but taught me how to be a man,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:56.240]   taught me about strength, about wisdom, about compassion, love, and that I could do anything
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.600]   that I set my mind to in this world, that anything was possible, and that I, of all people, can do it
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.760]   and not to let the world tell me otherwise. She passed away in Moscow, Russia,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:23.600]   she was 91 years old, soon to be 92. If you're listening to this, maybe the first words I can say
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.680]   is, at any moment life can end, so tell your friends, tell your family, your loved ones,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:44.080]   that you love them. So I tried to write the words, I couldn't, I have some disparate notes,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   but I decided to just speak about some lessons that she taught me, and I hope that it's useful
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   to some of you, to anyone who might be listening. The first lesson is to be mentally strong,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.400]   never to complain, and her life was one heck of a life to test that lesson.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.720]   She was born and raised near Kharkov, which is a Ukrainian city close to Russia.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.480]   In her childhood, she lived through and survived Koldomor, which is a famine in the early 30s,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   1932, 1933, that Stalin had inflicted on his own people, where millions of people have died.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.840]   One of the great atrocities of the 20th century. Just to give you some context,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.680]   the famine that we're talking about led to cannibalism. One historian has written that
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   the good people died first, the people who gave food to others, the people who refused
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.160]   to participate in cannibalism, the people who gave everything they have to their children
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.480]   for the survival of their children, and therefore died before their children did.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   I'll leave it at that. My grandma survived it, and as a teenager, she lived through and survived
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:25.360]   World War II. Imagine a young teenage girl, a beautiful young woman in a fascist-occupied city.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:34.560]   She rarely spoke of those times, but there were stories of no food, desperation, and tragedy.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.000]   And once again, I'll just leave it at that. My grandmother survived, and in her eyes always
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   remained this glimmer of hope amidst the suffering. It's a glimmer that I've seen in the eyes of
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.920]   others that I've met in my life, and it's just always inspiring to see that triumph,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.680]   that triumph over tragedy. And there's something that kind of experience does to the human heart.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.200]   It hardens it, it protects it from the outside world, but it also softens it
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.640]   to allow a deep connection with other human beings.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   And maybe you've seen that I've done a few things with David Goggins, and I'm drawn to that kind of
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.000]   mindset. In him, I see my grandmother, the toughest human being I've ever known. The
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.880]   second lesson she taught me was physical strength. There's all kinds of images throughout
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.400]   my childhood of my grandmother doing incredible feats of manual labor, carrying logs, just
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   carrying heavy things without complaining, just getting the job done. I was a huge fan in Russia,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.520]   there's something called Bogatiry, Bogatyr. I guess similar to America, that would be...
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.120]   America doesn't have centuries of history to where you can go to the period of knights
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   or Vikings. So in America, I guess for a little kid, that would be like a G.I. Joe.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.200]   But in Russia, that was Bogatiry, were kind of like the knights or maybe the Vikings,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.840]   the warriors of ancient history. And I've always loved the stoicism, the power, the fearlessness
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.480]   of the stories told about Bogatiry. I mean, as a little kid, that's all I wanted to be,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   is one of those guys. And I remember at a certain point in my childhood, I can't quite place
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   exactly the time, but I remember realizing, looking at my grandmother, that women could be
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.480]   those warriors as well. My little boy's brain and whatever toys we had, I'd play with. And I
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:12.000]   always imagined that Bogatiry were boys, men going out to war. And when they return as victors home,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.160]   they'd be celebrated by the women, the children of their family. But my grandmother made me
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.560]   realize that women could be Bogatiry too. But more than that, she was this figure in my life that
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   planted that Eastern European seed of admiring strength and physical power and just toughness
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.800]   in a very basic sense that's required to carry heavy things and to fight. I think if I were to
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   really psychoanalyze myself, at that early age is when I fell in love with martial arts,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:58.640]   with the whole concept of martial combat, before I ever, ever practiced anything like it. The kind
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.920]   of sports I played as a kid with soccer and tennis and swimming, all that kind of stuff,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.640]   were very far away from martial combat. But she planted the seed that when I first stepped on the
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.040]   wrestling mat, it felt like home. And even for the first couple of years when I really had my ass
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.840]   handed to me on the mat, the fire that got me to train harder, to work harder, that was my
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:35.200]   grandmother. The third lesson is to think deeply, to be quiet and think until you know the situation,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.960]   you know the right thing to say. And the right thing to say is the one that internalizes,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   considers and thinks through the big picture of the situation. So the emotion you feel,
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.440]   especially when you're young about a particular situation, the desire to be sort of a crybaby
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.160]   about things, about me, me, me, about being upset about this situation or that situation,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   there was something about the way she was quiet and the way she looked over the world
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:18.560]   and the moments when she spoke or words of wisdom, of calm and patience, that was so inspiring
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:25.520]   to a mind that was impatient. She helped me understand that the immediate emotional response
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.760]   to particular situations, the ups and downs of how you feel, influence the perception, the cognition
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.480]   of how everything's interpreted and taking your time, thinking, being quiet
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:48.160]   and speaking when you have something to say is the kind of man I should be. Fourth lesson
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.640]   she taught me was to believe in myself. She made me believe that I'm the most special person in
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.960]   the world and that I can achieve anything. And then she would tell me that since I was a little
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   baby until I was a big baby. And her excitement about the little successes in my life really made
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:19.280]   me fall in love with the successes of others. She inspired me to enjoy the success of others,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.640]   to believe in the people around me, to encourage them, to dream big, to work hard,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:35.360]   to accomplish anything because she did that for me. And you know, it's heartbreaking
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   to think that very few people in my life believed in me.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:50.640]   I was always a dreamer. I reached for the stars and most people, even people who loved me,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:58.240]   gave me what they thought was wise advice to stick to the safe path, to be reasonable, to
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:07.520]   find stability, comfort, all those kinds of things that seem wise in the grand scheme of life,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.720]   to be normal. And she didn't. She told me to go big, to dream big,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   and that I could accomplish anything I wanted to. Everyone is different and I'm not a parent.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:32.800]   And I think that kind of over-the-top encouragement can perhaps spoil some people or give
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:41.360]   them a false sense of ego. But for somebody like me, who was genetically full of self-doubt,
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:50.880]   and forgive me for saying even disliking myself, she was a breath of fresh air.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:11:00.400]   And so whatever dream I have now that still stays with me is the fire she kindled,
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:08.320]   is the fire she kept going, and a fire that will never die because of her.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:16.800]   Over the past several years, there's been many days that I'm grinding to a halt with self-doubt.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:26.720]   I feel that in all kinds of ways I'm a fraud for daring to dream, to go outside of
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.000]   what I'm supposed to do, what other people much smarter than me are telling me I'm supposed to do.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   In those moments, when I say I listen to my heart, I listen to my gut, I really listen
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:50.320]   to the thing that my grandmother left me. It's that fire, the belief in myself
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:58.720]   that I can do anything, that the dreams I have are not just silly dreams.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:08.160]   They're visions of a future that I can create. If I work hard, I can create.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.800]   And finally, the fifth lesson she taught me through words, through her actions,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:27.200]   is about love, is to put love out into the world.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:40.320]   Her husband, Grandpa Gregory, died when he was 58 in 1986.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:51.200]   She loved him her whole life. She loved him after he passed away. And that love, while quiet in terms
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.360]   of her not talking to me about it, was always there in the background, was always in her eyes,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:06.800]   the unshakable love. So that's the love between her and her husband, my grandfather.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.880]   There's something about loyalty, about deep, unshakable human connection in that,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:23.120]   that stayed with me. I seek that kind of love with friends, with really close friends. I seek
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.040]   that kind of love with the world around me. And I definitely seek that kind of love with a life
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:37.760]   partner, with a person that I could, how does the saying goes, ride or die with. I can bury the
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:46.080]   bodies with them. It's kind of a bond that's stronger than any other thing in this world,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.520]   a bond that's stronger than any fundamental force of physics. I could see it in her,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.600]   and something in that stayed with me. But bigger, just love, love of life,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:06.320]   love of the ups and downs of life, love and gratitude of everything around me.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:14.320]   She had that, this glowing joy. That's not a simple joy, but a deep joy that acknowledges
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:23.120]   that life is suffering, that life is hard, and that love is hard. But to appreciate it anyway.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:32.640]   The whole of it, not just the ups, the whole of it. She taught me to love people, love life,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:40.320]   love the world, no matter what the world does to you. And to love unconditionally, simply.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:52.560]   And to not be afraid to be cliche, to be simple, naive. Because that's what love is.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.680]   It's quite simple.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   Love is the answer, as some guy on some podcast once said.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:15.920]   So I wanted to honor this woman that was a great human being in my life and the life of many others
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:23.520]   with these words. And the few folks who listen, I hope, can draw some inspiration from the lessons
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:31.520]   she's given me. To be strong mentally and physically, to dream big, to work hard,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:42.560]   and to put a little bit of love out into the world. And on that point, let me, if it's okay,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.160]   read a poem in Russian that my grandmother enjoyed called Любовью дорожить умейте,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   loosely translated to Learn to Treasure Love by Stepan Shepachev.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.720]   Любовью дорожить умейте, с годами дорожить вдвойне. Любовь, не вздохи на скамейке,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:12.880]   и не прогулки при луне. Все будет слякоть и хороша, ведь вместе надо жизнь прожить.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   Любовь с хорошей песней схожа, а песню нелегко сложить.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.800]   It's a simple poem that a couple of Russians listening out there right now
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:33.200]   perhaps could appreciate. But the gist of it is that love is not easy, life is not easy,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:40.880]   and the best we ought to do is to learn how to treasure love, to treasure the few years of life
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:48.000]   we have on this earth. My grandmother's name is Anne, and my brother and I in Russian would
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.240]   call her affectionately бабаня. So, бабань, я уже слушаю тебя.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:04.640]   I promise I will work hard and hope that your strength, your brilliance,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.400]   your love lives on in my thoughts and in my actions.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.800]   This drop of vodka is for you.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:32.480]   You know, I have shot glasses, but I think she's looking down and
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:41.120]   knows I'm drinking in her memory, so she would want me to drink it out of a real glass.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:18:03.920]   So, бабань, I miss you, I love you, I hope to make you proud one day.
