[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.120]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.920]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.520]   Today I am excited to welcome back to Radical Personal Finance, Jacob Lund Fisker, host
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.760]   or I guess I should say author of one of my favorite books on financial freedom called
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.560]   Early Retirement Extreme, author of the blog by the same title.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   Jacob, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.240]   Yeah, thank you very much.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.800]   I mean, it's been what, six years, seven?
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160]   It's been a long time.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.280]   Last time we had an epic three-hour podcast that for quite a while was the most listened
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.480]   to episode of my show, and we really had a great time.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.840]   It's been now how many years since you retired?
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.320]   Well, first time or second time around.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.680]   I mean, I don't really think of it as retired per se, more like the option to do what I
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.600]   want whenever I want, whatever reason, right?
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.640]   But I mean, I retired, I stopped with my physics career in 2009, and then I had a stint in
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.240]   high finance, Wall Street kind of stuff between 2012 and 2015.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   So I guess technically it's been five years.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.000]   So about five years since you left the world of finance.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.160]   So what I'd like to begin our conversation with today is just simply to ask you a little
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:41.440]   bit about how you view your personal financial philosophy and the path that you've taken
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.680]   with the benefit of hindsight.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.620]   Do you continue to feel satisfied with the path that you've taken with your life and
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.840]   your career, the early retirement extreme lifestyle so far?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.640]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's working pretty well.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.600]   I mean, it's sort of currently being cast within the framework of fire, but to me, as
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   a financial independence retired early, but I never really saw those two things as the
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.120]   main characteristics of my philosophy per se.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.640]   I mean, financial independence was more of a side effect that just followed from the
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.400]   way I was otherwise living.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.520]   So I'd say in contrast to what it has sort of become, it was not really a milestone for
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.600]   me as much as just a checkbox as in like, "Hey, now I can do this.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.520]   I have these options now that I didn't have before."
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.560]   And from my perspective, it's almost like financial independence is so simple that I
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   often find myself wondering why is it not something everybody's doing?
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:58.640]   So I mean, in that sense, I'm living the same way that I've always, yeah, always probably
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   pretty close description.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.720]   I've lived this way for like almost 20 years now.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   So I mean, it's working good for me and I'm getting better and better at it.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.800]   Basically, I mean, my original motivation was to figure out how to live with a sustainable
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   footprint.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.720]   And what I did was to essentially look at the world GDP and look at the ecological footprint
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.000]   of the world and the world population and then calculate very simply how much could
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   I spend if we all had to live with the same amount, same size slice of the pie.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.280]   And that number back then when I calculated in 2000, 2001 was about $6,000 per year.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.720]   And so I wanted to figure out how that would be possible.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.280]   And calculating it now, you get, I think, numbers sort of lag a little bit, but I think
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.840]   the 2019 numbers were 6,750.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.720]   So I've stayed sort of like in the 6,000 to 7,000 range for a while, while having like
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.280]   jobs that paid more, not spectacularly much, but then I just saved that.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.160]   And for like the first four years, I did not even really know what to do with it.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.600]   It was just sitting in a savings account because I knew that I did not grow up in the US.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.240]   Where I come from, this whole stock investing was thought of more as speculating back then.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.120]   So I was just putting it in a savings account with the aim to buy a house.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.880]   So I'm kind of happy with it.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:46.160]   - You're often talked about in the world of financial media for your frugality.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.880]   Famously, many years ago, you were talked about as someone who could live on $7,000
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.680]   a year in California by some of the decisions that you made.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.720]   But what I think a lot of people missed and didn't understand was that this came from
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.880]   a philosophical perspective that had a lot to do with sustainability and ecology.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.800]   Your goal was not simply to spend a small amount so you could quit working.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.640]   Your goal was to have a more modest footprint.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640]   Is that right?
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   - Right, right.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   I mean, it's a very simplistic way of seeing it just in terms of money, but that's where
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.760]   people come from, right?
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.320]   But I mean, admittedly, I grew up like your standard consumer.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.640]   And before that, I started this when I was 24, when I was in grad school.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.160]   So before that, I was sort of the regular consumer gadget, free techno-optimist, just
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   having to have the newest stuff all the time.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.920]   But then I had a little bit of an epiphany at that age, and then I changed track completely
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.160]   and realized I actually did not really know much about how to live well and very little.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.000]   So like with most people, I initially started out sacrificing.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.360]   That's sort of like the trivial, the context-free knowledge.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   You don't know anything.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.280]   So what is the simplest thing you can do?
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.880]   You can just cut things away, right?
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:24.320]   And then over the past 20 years, I've learned more and more skills and learned how to combine
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   them.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.680]   So I've been able to stretch my money further and further and further.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.320]   So I would say at this point, I mean, our lifestyle, we now live in a house in the western
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.960]   suburbs, about eight-ish miles from Chicago downtown, so just where the city ends and
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.680]   the taxation ends.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.400]   And it's rather indistinguishable, I would say, from our neighbors.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.520]   I mean, if you visit us, you can see there's some weird things going on.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.920]   Like we grow lettuce indoors, or we store food, which turned out to be great for COVID.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.000]   And we're like one of â€“ I wouldn't say the only, but we're one of the few people who
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.680]   don't have a lawn in our backyard.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.320]   I double-dig everything up, and now we grow vegetables.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.840]   Last year, we had like 339 pounds.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.200]   I weighed everything.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.240]   I've started obsessing about this, like how well can we do this?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   I've learned woodworking.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.320]   I've learned lots of different things.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:35.120]   So when people think about 7,000, and they're spending, say, 70,000 themselves, they think,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.280]   "Okay, he's living on a tenth of what I do, and I feel like I should have more money,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.200]   so his life must be 10 times as miserable as mine is."
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:51.080]   But in reality, I spend my 7,000, and my wife spends another 7,000, so about 14,000 in total
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.840]   for two adults.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.360]   We spend it very, very differently.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.280]   Our budget looks completely different than sort of the mainstream consumer, or I would
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.040]   maybe even say the typical fireperson.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:10.120]   - What were the influences when you were in grad school that caused you to move from your
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.680]   more consumption-oriented ways into your current philosophy?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.280]   - Yeah, okay, that's a good question.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.920]   So I would say, I mean, back then, it was like Web 1.0, where people did these corny
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.800]   web pages if they had something to say.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.080]   There was no blogs, and no YouTube, no Facebook.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   Even MySpace was not a thing.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.720]   So typically, you would come across some kind of website, and you'd read about that, and
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.960]   then you could follow it around, links to links to links.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.760]   So I can't really point on a single thing like you can today.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.520]   I found this blog, and this guy was cool, and I just did what he did.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.280]   That's sort of the typical story today.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.920]   But back then, it was more put together, a bunch of many different things.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.880]   And I had to sort of make sense out of everything myself, because I didn't know what I didn't
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.680]   know, so to speak.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.400]   But I think if I had to point at a progenitor site, so to speak, I would say there was a
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   site called Burdened.net, I think it was.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:28.400]   It was an anti-consumer site that talked a lot about the other side of our growth economy,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.600]   as in what happens to all our junk, all the crap we buy when we're done using it, when
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.320]   it goes to the landfill, what happens, and where do our resources come from.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.880]   So before that, I was just sort of seeing a very narrow picture of the entire cycle,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:57.560]   sort of like from the supermarket to my shelves and my phone, and then to the trash can.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.760]   That wasn't even much of a thing like Craigslist or eBay.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.960]   So typically, if you bought something and you got tired of it, then it just got filed
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.640]   in the attic, it just sat there.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.440]   Like dispersed entropy of our consumer goods.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.960]   And that led me to the PGOIL community, which was a big thing at the time.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.580]   So that's like always, I would say in general, like three different sort of pressure points
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.580]   for humanity.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:30.840]   There's either population or resources, the resource depletion or the pollution side.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.880]   So at any one point over the past, I would say, 100 years, and probably going from the
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.040]   20s to the 21st century, it'll be one of these three things.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.840]   So my population was essentially solved-ish in the 20th century for now.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.000]   And energy was the thing back then.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   And the concern back then was that the world would very soon run out of oil.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.920]   I mean, the energy consumption per capita peaked in the late 70s on a global basis.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.160]   And I'm not sure, I don't actually think it has recovered yet.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.600]   And of course, we know that in the US, it peaked initially in '72, which completely
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.360]   changed the geopolitical structure of how the US behaved on an international basis.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.840]   And shale gas kind of flipped that back again for a while.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.400]   So my initial goal, based on the footprint, was to try to figure out how to live in a
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   world where resources were harder to come by, so become more self-reliant.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.160]   So that was my original initial drive.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.080]   And then I was in grad school at the time.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:50.880]   I liked doing physics, and they paid me about, I think, somewhere between 20 and 25,000.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.960]   I think in grad school today in physics, you earn about 30k a year.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.320]   And since I was only spending like 6k, I could save the other, right?
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.760]   So that gave me a savings rate of around 75%.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   And so those just went in on a savings account.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.080]   And it was only later that...
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.880]   I mean, initially, those savings were intended to purchase a house in cash, because I did
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.120]   not want to get locked into a mortgage.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.440]   It's like a death sentence, right?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   Something like that.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.440]   Death pledge.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.000]   Yeah, death pledge.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.560]   So I wanted to buy a house in cash.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.800]   And it was only after I came to the US, but that happened very quickly, because you just
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.600]   get infused with this whole market economy thinking that, "Wow, if I invest this at 3%
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:44.240]   instead of 2%, then I would be pretty close to being able to make a living doing that.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.080]   And I would not be stuck in this academic track I was on.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   And I would not have to depend on a job, for example.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.480]   So I just wanted that freedom instead of a house.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.280]   I mean, I sort of started moving around in the world and getting settled in a house that
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.720]   sort of faded out of my now unconventional thinking.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.400]   I mean, ironically, we did eventually buy a house in cash.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.920]   I'd like to ask a question about this philosophy and how you've shared it.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.360]   I've followed your work for many years.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.360]   You've done a little bit more media over the last few months, and I haven't followed every
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.980]   single one of those interviews.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.440]   But I read most of your written content.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.280]   And while I understood that you had an attraction to environmental consciousness and ecological
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.080]   sustainability, and I knew that that was a component of your thinking, that was never
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.240]   the primary thing that you led with.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.960]   You would often lead your message with a conversation about financial freedom and the lifestyle
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.200]   of going sailing on the bay and spending time with no boss.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.500]   And one of the things that I have observed as I watch the world, I see that so many people
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.160]   market their ideas in what I think are ineffective ways.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.960]   And specifically, we're talking about one of those that I think is marketed ineffectively.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:16.160]   Many people who are very concerned about ecological sustainability market their philosophy with
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:21.260]   a sense of guilt to try to cause people to feel bad about their consumption and to cause
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:27.760]   people to say no and deny themselves and stop being a consumer because you should feel guilty
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.880]   for your impact on the planet.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   But I've observed that you can market it with just simply frugality and personal freedom,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   and you can kind of wind up in the same place.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.900]   If you were to go back 10 years, were you conscious of what you were doing?
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.560]   Were you intentionally trying to get people to join you with a lower consumption lifestyle
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.360]   and leading it with a positive marketing message, or did that just naturally occur?
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.640]   No, that was very sneaky and very intentional.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:07.900]   So one of the things we kind of learned with the peak oil movement was that it was essentially
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.120]   preaching to the choir, very much so.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.520]   And it was very hard to break out of this chamber of people because whenever you went
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.200]   elsewhere and said, "Okay, we have big problems here with the oil supply and that is going
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.020]   to cause some suffering, maybe loss of life, etc., etc.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.440]   Very depressing stuff, population bottlenecks.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.920]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:39.620]   And almost always, I mean, when you first find something that is so life-changing, when
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.740]   you first discover that, you feel like telling other people about it, you know, like, "Oh,"
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.500]   you know, right?
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:53.180]   And almost inevitably and without any exception, people would always tell me, "Oh, Jacob, this
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.180]   is so depressing.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.980]   Please, please shut up about it.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.660]   There's nothing I can do about it anyway.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.900]   I'm like stuck in this life, etc."
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.480]   And I'd rather not hear about it.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.140]   You see the same thing with climate change today.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:15.220]   So I figured, well, I mean, like you said, I've been living in this way that is actually
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:22.500]   compatible with potentially solving this problem, at least protecting myself somewhat, becoming
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.740]   somewhat self-reliant, increasing some resilience.
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.820]   But there's also this other side of it, which is I've sort of found a different way to play
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:43.840]   the game, which led to financial independence and not being stuck in this sort of life,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:50.220]   what Thoreau called "lives of quiet desperation," or what I prefer the term "comfortable misery."
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.180]   And I'm not really happy about the way we're living, you know, but at least it's comfortable.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.860]   It's miserable, comfortable, and safe.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.500]   That seems to sort of be what people try to optimize for.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:14.780]   And so the reach by offering, well, you can have this and you can have financial freedom.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:25.780]   And more importantly, you can do something without the most typical approach in these
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:30.940]   communities is essentially that the solution is to build community.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.780]   So say, okay, the climate is changing.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.780]   There's going to be problems.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.780]   What's the first step?
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.820]   Well, we've got to find, we're going to form a community of people who see this problem,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.780]   and then we've got to study it as a community.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.860]   And then once we've studied, we've got to find a community solution, and then we got
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.020]   to implement it as a community.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.340]   So I've tried doing a little bit of that as well.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.940]   You know, I was involved in a nonprofit for a while, almost concurrently with writing
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.500]   the ERE blog.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.780]   That's what I did right after I quit physics.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.900]   But the problem is always, I mean, at the community level, you can sit and talk and
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:20.220]   agree on stuff, but it's hard to do the leadership required to get everybody to pull in the same
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.980]   direction.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.820]   Especially when people as individuals, you know, we essentially as consumers, we've been
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.100]   divided and conquered.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:34.580]   So that we can't really do anything because, well, we had to go to work every day, right?
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.540]   And we had to pay our mortgage, we had to pay our bills and so on.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:44.940]   And so with the financial independence thing, you can try to do sort of attack the problem
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.380]   at an individual level and say, okay, we can't, communities are really difficult, but at least
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.380]   you can do this.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.180]   If you do this and you get all these other benefits, and then some people are of course
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.460]   going to say, well, I don't believe in reality.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.100]   I think technology can solve all our problems.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.580]   And instead of me being frustrated by that, I could say, well, that's great as long as
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.180]   you're spending a little less, you know, that's helping the problem.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.060]   There's no longer hurting the problem.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.300]   And it's kind of the same thing when people ask me, what do you think about the fire movement
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   these days?
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.220]   And I'm like, well, practically nobody is spending 7,000.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.340]   Isn't that like bad or something?
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:29.820]   Well, I mean, if you can take people who otherwise would have spent 100,000 and get them to spend
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.860]   70,000, right?
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:39.660]   That's, you know, for each one of those being sort of converted or changing their lifestyle
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:44.740]   is worth like five of my kind, right?
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:53.300]   So in that sense, I think that has been way more effective than the approach where you
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.260]   go after essentially attacking the problem directly.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:08.100]   - So when you look at the fire movement and you consider, I guess, as one of the more
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:15.300]   well-known inspirations in the space, when you look at the fire movement, I hear that
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.460]   you're satisfied that at least we're moving in the right direction in terms of your personal
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.140]   goal of getting people to consume at a more reasonable level and that we're doing it with
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:32.100]   a more easily marketable message, helping people to live a better lifestyle, focus on
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.360]   financial freedom, and then having the environmental benefits as in some ways an unintended side
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.220]   effect for many people.
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.500]   What are your thoughts though in terms of what you see to the extent that you watch
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.740]   the fire movement at all?
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.700]   Do you feel like things have been changed?
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.820]   Are you happy with the direction?
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.820]   What are your thoughts?
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:57.980]   - Yeah, so I mean, first of all, of course, the fire movement is huge now.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.480]   So it's much bigger than the three or four people that we were like in the 2010.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.260]   So if I make blanket statements about it, I'm probably going to piss people off, at
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.800]   least some of them, right?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.180]   But I think there are two perspectives on it.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:19.220]   So the first thing is that the space has sort of filled out.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:25.460]   Back then, it was quite easy to dismiss me as being this crazy guy who lived in an RV
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.900]   at the time.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.020]   You're familiar with the Wheaton EcoScale, right?
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.660]   - Yes, Paul Wheaton.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.660]   Paul Wheaton says that...
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.660]   Go ahead, you can explain it.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:44.700]   - Yeah, so he made the Wheaton EcoScale to describe the problem with doing outreach or
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.620]   explaining complex things within permaculture.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:56.660]   And I found that the same problem actually exists with the ERE philosophy, because it's
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:03.900]   substantially more complex than just earn more than you spend and put everything in
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:12.140]   an index fund, which is kind of what the intro fire movement has sort of settled on.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:19.300]   So these days, I would say the ERE or the fire Wheaton scale has filled out.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:25.180]   So it's a lot easier to find someone who's inspiring to you, someone who's not too extreme.
[00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:29.380]   And once you've sort of learned things at a given level, you can move on to the next
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.660]   level and find a new teacher to inspire you.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.780]   And you can almost always find another one who knows just a little bit more and when
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.340]   you're ready to move to the next step.
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.140]   And that did not exist in the beginning.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.500]   Even 10 years ago, people didn't really know where to put this kind of movement, what it
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   was.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.100]   At least like promoters of senior living lifestyles.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.220]   There was this huge discussion about what retirement actually was.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.300]   I mean, you're probably part of the early stuff.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.220]   It was immensely frustrating because of course, retirement does not mean the same to someone
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.700]   who does it at age 35, as opposed to someone who retires at age 75.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:23.700]   I'd say sort of like on the flip side of that, of having it having grown much bigger, is
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.580]   that to a large degree, the sort of like the public appearance of the fire movement has
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   changed.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:36.140]   I mean, we started out as a bunch of nerds who wanted to solve the problems of the world.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:42.660]   And now it's sort of been taking over by entrepreneurial business oriented types who are seeking to
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:53.380]   sell seminars and camps and travels and consulting services and what have you.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.700]   And fire has, I mean, the media narrative now for fire, which I think might be somewhat
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.820]   justified is that it's mainly a bunch of software engineers with six figure incomes who, you
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.020]   know, pat each other on the back for being frugal when they spend like 10% less than
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.020]   their co-workers.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.660]   Right.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.700]   And I think there's some truth to that.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:21.900]   And I think the problem with that is that the original intention is somewhat gone.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.300]   That people who are not into the fire movement, who have not familiarized with sort of like
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:33.720]   that it is a very diverse set of people get the impression, well, that's just a bunch
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.460]   of rich people who want to be millionaires.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.820]   That's the impression I'm getting.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:45.060]   And that could be completely wrong because I'm not really such a big, big part of sort
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.900]   of like the active fire movement.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:50.260]   I don't know if that's correct.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.580]   So that's what I mean.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.740]   Right.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.740]   So I'd like to pivot a little bit here because I wanted to get a little bit of your backstory
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.540]   and kind of update it.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:08.060]   But one observation or one area where I'd really like to explore with you is specifically
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.240]   some of the technical details.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.180]   When you stopped writing for early retirement extreme, you went into the investment world
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.500]   and you spent several years working as a professional quant.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:26.620]   And so I think you've often had a deeper level of analysis from the perspective of investing
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:34.340]   and personal financial management than many people who haven't had that kind of experience.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:44.300]   Do you look at, given your background, thinking about big systemic risks, do you think that
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.660]   the way that financial independence is talked about with many people, things like the 4%
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.340]   rule, using index funds, etc., do you think that these are safe ways to pursue financial
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.860]   freedom for most people?
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:03.380]   Well, I mean, not that nothing is safe, right?
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.380]   I think maybe that's the problem, that there's not really this realization that people are
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:13.500]   actually dealing with financial markets and not a savings account.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.020]   I think from that perspective, it's important to understand that the financial markets are
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.900]   a complex adaptive system.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.060]   So it's not an engineering problem as much as it's a socioeconomic or social problem
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.100]   or philosophical problem.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:36.580]   So by a complex adaptive system, I mean that complex usually implies many components that
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:44.600]   are connected in different ways that are not immediately obvious.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.100]   We have many different kinds of products and many different kinds of agents like private
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.700]   investors, institutions, entire governments, and they do not necessarily have the same
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.700]   goals.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.020]   They have different interests.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.380]   And not all of these interests are necessary that the market should go up.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.500]   I mean, if you're like a big bank, you might not care much that the market goes up because
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.500]   you're making your money doing transactions.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.980]   And adaptive means that people are mainly looking out for their own interests and not
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.060]   so much the market as itself.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:25.980]   So the financial markets adapt to the environment as it changes and it adapts to itself.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:33.460]   And I think the problem is when you get down to the sort of like the more simplistic level,
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:39.340]   like what's currently popular sort of in the, I would say, what's a good term for this?
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.340]   Retail analysis is probably a bad term.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:49.700]   Typical fire movement planning is that people like to use statistics to try to sort of get
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:56.860]   a grip on what this complex adaptive system is doing so it's easier to think about it.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:01.460]   And that's where you get things like the 4% rule.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.900]   And the problem with that are things like, well, you take the average of all returns
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.620]   and you get something like 10% per year, right?
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:14.900]   Because that's what the market has returned historically for most of the 20th century.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.380]   And then you can do something like sequence of returns, or you can do the sequence of
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   returns randomly and you can say, okay, the minimum withdrawal rate is 4%.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:27.900]   And the problem there is I think at least that's my impression of seeing people talk
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.460]   about the 4% rule as they treat it very much like a permanent savings account or like an
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.460]   annuity.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.660]   Well, all you have to do is you throw everything in stocks and then you like wave your hands
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.660]   a bit and you say 4% rule in the long run.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:55.060]   And that means you can take out 4% constantly just because historically the proof essentially
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.380]   is in the 20th century.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:02.340]   But I mean, the 20th century, speaking a little bit more as a sort of like an operator, as
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.500]   a professional would have a different view of how this works.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:14.620]   Especially as a quant, you're very concerned about what your sample data is and what the
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:20.620]   population data is and whether those two are the same thing.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:32.860]   So one of the problems, like in the 90s, there were people doing a lot of day trading.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.900]   They almost stopped working, took out credit card debt, and then they started day trading
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.660]   dot com stocks.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.060]   You see a little bit, I mean, we tried to have like a little bit of like a resurgence
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.020]   of that with games, game stonks, meme stonks and all that.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:54.620]   And everybody, as long as the main market goes trends upwards, right, then you can sit
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.240]   and day trade along that major trend and think you're a genius.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.540]   You can even do pretty bad because you have this kind of rising tide underneath you that
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.900]   pushes everybody up.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.360]   So that overall, you'll have more successes and you will have failures.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.080]   So you'll have a positive return rate, even though you might be adding negative alpha
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.800]   to that trend.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:21.180]   So the 20th century had a lot of trends that often go ignored.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:27.460]   The 20th century in the US, particularly where the 4% rule comes from, has some trends that
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:32.660]   might not be sustainable in the 21st century.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.700]   I mean, you had, especially if you do more recent data sets, like from the 80s, you have
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.920]   had interest rates that have just gone from like 20% down to zero.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.820]   So if your investment history or autobiography is from that period, you have, through your
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:56.060]   entire investment career, been operating in a world where interest rates have been declining,
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:02.060]   which all things being equal pushes stocks upwards just because of that.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.180]   Not from any inherent sort of investment strategy in stocks, but just because interest rates
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.180]   are declining.
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:12.940]   The 20th century also has had the US rising to become a dominant economy in the world,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:20.860]   essentially a global empire, if you will, winning the Cold War, sort of underline that.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.940]   That cannot be repeated.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.220]   It's already the world empire, right?
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.500]   So we cannot do that again.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.500]   So you do not get that boost again.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:34.300]   The thing I mentioned earlier about energy use per capita increased until it peaked in
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.340]   the late 70s.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.340]   So that is also on the decline.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:45.160]   So now we're looking more at growth in efficiency of energy use, like the carbon efficiency.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:51.580]   So how much GDP do we get for each barrel of oil, instead of looking at how many barrels
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.700]   of oil can we drag out of the ground?
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.900]   So that's a different kind of economy again.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.660]   So that's changing as well.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:05.220]   And so if you're working in the quant world, trying to analyze these stuff, list off mathematically
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.100]   to find some kind of trading strategy, you want to detrend these things.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:14.660]   So you can see if you are actually adding some like intelligent strategy to this, or
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.500]   you're just riding a high tide.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:25.180]   So the trends for declining productivity growth, because we essentially have the best economy
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.540]   on the planet, right?
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.260]   So it's hard to improve it.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:34.540]   We have picked the low hanging fruit on all the branches, and there's less food further
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.780]   up.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.180]   So we have a lot of infrastructure debt that we need to pay to.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:45.460]   So in that sense, and you can see that if you take the 4% rule and try it in other countries,
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.940]   you don't get 4%, right?
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.580]   If you go to countries that lost World War II, it's more like a 1% rule or a half percent
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.020]   rule.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.580]   Because if you lose a World War, that's pretty bad.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.300]   So that was a long answer.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.420]   It's pretty damaging to lose a World War.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:10.460]   So this is trying to think of what order to approach this in, because the things that
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.660]   you're talking about are things that are important to me.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:23.220]   And I'm not waving my hands and attacking something like the 4% rule with passive index
