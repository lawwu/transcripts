[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   When my parents naturally asked me if there was anything I wanted for my birthday,
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.440]   I threw out the idea that, what if we drove the kids to their house with our au pair,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.800]   and they all could watch the kids for a week, and we could take a 40th birthday trip?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   They said yes to my surprise, and it was time to plan an entirely different trip.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   So, first step, I canceled the kids' tickets to Paris.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We ate the 140-euro fee because, of course, they weren't coming.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.960]   And we canceled our return flights, which, thankfully, because I booked with a few more aeroplane miles, had no fee.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   And now we needed to figure out a plan.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.800]   And so we started with return flights.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.000]   And the reason we did this was because we had a lot less flexibility.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.800]   And so we really had two dates that we could find flights back home, but we only needed two seats.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Fortunately, it wasn't hard to find two seats from Zurich back to San Francisco direct.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   I think we were using a combination of Point.me and AwardTool, but we found these flights,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.600]   And we were actually able to use some of those refunded Air Canada miles to book them.
