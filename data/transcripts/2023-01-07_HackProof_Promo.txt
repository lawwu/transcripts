[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.680]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   My name is Josh Rasheeds.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.640]   I'm your host and today I'm excited to bring back on the show Gabriel Custodiat and we're
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   going to share with you about a brand new course that we are presenting.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.360]   Gabriel, welcome back.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.440]   Thank you and here's a radical idea, Josh.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.640]   It doesn't matter how you get your money or how much you have if somebody takes it.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.840]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.000]   Gabriel and I have been collaborating over the past year on our Bitcoin Privacy course,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.080]   which by the way is still available at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.480]   We have scores of very satisfied students who have gone out into the marketplace, who
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.800]   have purchased Bitcoin completely anonymously, who own it completely privately and anonymously
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.680]   and who continue to enjoy excellent buying opportunities with Bitcoin at low prices where
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.240]   you can stock up and build your personal bank.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.840]   That's available at BitcoinPrivacyCourse.com.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.720]   But in talking about opportunities and where there is needs in the marketplace, we discussed
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   the need for becoming hack-proof and today we are excited to talk about our brand new
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.200]   course that's available at HackProofCourse.com.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.800]   Gabriel, share a little bit about the problem as least as you see it and why we're even
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200]   doing this course in the first place.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.640]   Yeah, so you know the most common person that I consult with is somebody who emails me in
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840]   a panic or calls me in real life and they say that the money is being taken out of their
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.280]   PayPal account or they're getting suspicious emails from Coinbase and now they can't log
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   in.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.200]   So, for example, this Coinbase person, they didn't realize that they were using a Yahoo
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.920]   email address for their account and Yahoo had been compromised the last few years.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.420]   And so an Indonesian hacking team simply had access to that Yahoo email login and they
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.360]   just reset the Coinbase password and bam, they're in.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.960]   And so, you know, the statistics bear out that this will happen to you one day.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.680]   You'll get hacked, you'll get digitally compromised in some way if you don't take an active role
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.960]   in educating yourself.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.280]   And so that's what we're aiming for in this hack-proof course.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.560]   Or it's going to be your child, your parents, and that's also going to affect you.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.480]   And the terror in the voices of my clients in these moments is the terror of I trusted
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.800]   somebody online, I trusted an online platform to protect me or some technology and they
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.920]   didn't and I don't know how this stuff works and so I feel totally vulnerable.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   And you know what?
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920]   They are.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   I think people just don't understand how this crazy digital world works.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.280]   We're encouraged to put everything online when almost none of us understand what that
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   means.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.040]   People don't understand how many third parties we're trusting our data to on a single website.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.640]   So for example, you go to eBay.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   They may have two dozen other companies who are collecting your data, each with their
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.840]   own vulnerabilities.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.720]   And of course, 90% plus of our wealth exists digitally.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.680]   We have online accounts sensitive to our business lives, our love lives, our financial lives.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.880]   A lot of our stuff is online.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.480]   And so at a fundamental level, what we're teaching in this course is a mindset in addition
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.760]   to some tools that will greatly lessen your odds of having your digital life compromised.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.680]   That's what we're shooting for and hopefully allow you to, after putting in some effort
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   to understand it, put your head on your pillow at night knowing that you're as safe as you
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.180]   can be.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.960]   So how do we do that?
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.720]   Well, as with all things, I like to start with the fundamentals.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.800]   So we explain how this works.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.100]   What are data breaches?
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.380]   What are third parties?
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.640]   How do hackers do their thing?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640]   What are their methods?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   What are your vulnerabilities?
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960]   We start with the basics.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.320]   And I'll say that over the years, and especially preparing for this course, I read most of
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.820]   the stuff out there about hacking, scamming, identity theft.
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.520]   And again, like in our Bitcoin course, I was disappointed by what I found.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.700]   I read the most promising book on the topic of scamming, and it simply wasn't up to date.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.640]   It doesn't mention anything about getting off of people search websites, nothing about
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.740]   zero knowledge services, doesn't say anything about doing less with your phone or keeping
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.320]   a minimal computer or using temporary email addresses, offline software, planting your
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.960]   flag on online accounts, doesn't say anything about VoIP phone numbers to reduce your chance
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.560]   of getting SIM swapped.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.320]   So a lot of the information out there is simply not up to date.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.120]   So I at least, I'm looking at the hacker forums where people are selling credit cards by the
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   thousands.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.680]   I know what these people are doing.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.200]   I know what information is already out there.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   I have my podcast.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   I keep a book.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   I consult.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.400]   I immerse my stuff in this daily.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.440]   And so in four hours in this course, I'm going to show you an accumulation of my time understanding
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.840]   how this stuff happens, but most importantly, laying out the practices, the mindset, and
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.440]   the tools that you can live by.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   - And I think that's the most important thing is just to recognize that if you are concerned
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.920]   about these things, there's no magic fix.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.300]   You have to begin with the end in mind.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.720]   You have to begin with good personal privacy practices.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.600]   And it's not that hard to engage in good, if not just better personal privacy practices,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.880]   but it does require a little bit of upfront thinking.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.080]   And in these areas, by the way, many of us are accustomed to the primary vectors of financial
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.280]   risk and financial theft being things like false credit card charges.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.760]   And I think we're wrongly comfortable because there is no fraud, because we are protected
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.360]   from fraud on things like credit card transactions, that then we think that applies to other things.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.560]   But this kind of hacking, these kinds of thefts do not have any consumer protections.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.480]   They are in fact, of course, illegal.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.800]   But if your accounts are invaded and your Coinbase wallet is emptied out, or if your
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.840]   stock account is emptied out, when this is done by a hacker in a foreign country, you
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.040]   don't have much recourse at all.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.080]   And so you have to be the one to protect yourself in advance.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.440]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   Nobody's coming for you, especially in the case of crypto, which is irreversible.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.920]   And I just want to throw out some statistics for people who are trying to grasp what cybercrime
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   is.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.560]   Cybercrime is a $10 trillion industry in the world.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.240]   That's what, $1,400 per person per year, cybercrime.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.440]   And it's only increasing, right?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.560]   And just to focus in on a subset of cybercrime, we have identity theft, which is also growing.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.320]   Every 22 seconds in the US, somebody is a victim of identity theft.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.800]   And at its worst, identity theft victims have psychological effects comparable to being
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.120]   in active wartime.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.360]   Okay, this is no joke.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   And so every 22 seconds, you're rolling the dice.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   Is that going to be you?
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   And if you're not scared, you should be.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.960]   I'm scared and I do this for a living, right?
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.240]   And I'm scared because there are people who wake up every morning in Moscow, in India,
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:13.720]   in Pakistan, in North Korea, people smarter than you or I, and their single goal during
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.860]   their 16-hour workday is to move money from your account to their account.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.800]   There are entire businesses and industries in places like this that are set up.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.000]   How could somebody live with themself doing that?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.860]   Because people outside the West often don't have the same moral consciousness we have.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.200]   You can watch my recent interview with Jain Pandari about that sad reality.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.160]   And so this is what you're up against.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.800]   And so the grandma, and this brings up another interesting question, the grandma in Iowa
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.720]   who refuses to learn two-factor authentication from her grandson is not only, let's say,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:53.080]   losing $2,000 when she's compromised, but she's giving that $2,000 to maybe North Korea,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.980]   who gets a lot of their money from these kind of scams.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.240]   And she just funded five people being sent to death camps.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.960]   Okay, so that's the big picture.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   Here are the consequences, not just for you, for your family, for other people in the world.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.340]   Cybercrime is a huge industry.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.360]   It affects everybody and it's only growing.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.760]   No, it's a good point.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.200]   And I think we often underestimate the impact for us, but also the impact for others all
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   around the world.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.560]   I certainly don't want to be funding any malfactors around the world.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.540]   Given the fact that there's so much information out there for free, I think there's a huge
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:34.000]   value to these digital courses because they're up to date, like you mentioned.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   But who is this course for?
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.680]   Yeah, so obviously it is a course for everybody, right?
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.200]   It's a course for people who care about keeping their money, who feel a moral responsibility
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.040]   to deprive the enemy, people who care about their finances, right?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.980]   What does it matter how much you earn if you lose it to a scammer or an identity thief?
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.080]   It's for people who run a small business and who are much larger targets than anybody else
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.060]   by a huge margin.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.280]   It's for people who work at home and now have their digital life in front of them for 12
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.440]   hours a day, or who are mixing their business and their personal lives on their computer
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.400]   for the last couple of years.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.320]   It's for people who don't like the idea of waking up one morning and having your website
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.900]   hijacked and in control, in somebody else's control.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.340]   It's for people who care about their privacy and for whom the idea of your private details
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.000]   or credentials being on somebody else's computer brings a serious distaste to your mouth.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.160]   It's for people who don't want disruptions to their healthcare, right?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.740]   Medical fraud is a huge scam that is only increasing.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.480]   And everybody in between, it's for people who want to develop a mindset, not just read
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   an outdated list, to-do list that you're going to forget and implement, but people who want
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:58.320]   to lay the bedrock of a locked down digital life that can give them and their family comfort.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.480]   And regardless of the changes in technology in the upcoming years, have the foundation
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.000]   to keep their money, to keep their accounts secure, and to avoid becoming part of this
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   immense statistic of cybercrime.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.000]   So we're presenting the course the way we did the Bitcoin Privacy course.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.880]   It was an extremely successful model.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.240]   We're doing two live classes.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.120]   There'll be two separate two-hour sessions.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.680]   The first will be on February 3, and then the second one will be on February 10.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.760]   We'll present those courses live to all the students who sign up.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.440]   And the benefit of signing up for the live class is that you will have the opportunity
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.520]   to interact with us live in the chat and ask your questions.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   So not only do you get access to the prepared curriculum, the prepared course material that
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.920]   is current and cutting edge and up to date, but you can also ask your very current questions
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.080]   and get specific advice, specific answers to your questions.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.640]   That's coming up on February 3 and on February 10.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.240]   If you'd like to sign up for the course, please do so at HackProofCourse.com.

[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.640]   Gabriel, anything we forgot?
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.840]   >>Gabriel Just to say that according to the statistics I told you, this course will pay
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.960]   itself off very quickly, maybe within months.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.840]   And if you're still on the fence after what we've said here, that's fine.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.440]   Just remember that in addition to us putting out content from our brands, which is intrinsically
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.120]   useful, remember that you engaging with us in this course is also supporting both radical
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.160]   personal finance and watch and privacy.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.640]   So you're not only getting something useful, but you're investing in us so that we can
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.080]   continue to make high quality courses, books, and podcasts.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.280]   >>Ashkahn The reason we're doing this is that some of this is just basically good disaster
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.640]   protection.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   And I think a lot about, I describe it as increase income, decrease expenses, and avoid
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   catastrophe.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.280]   Those are the big three that we do in financial planning.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.000]   And what Gabriel and I are looking to do is look in the marketplace and say, where is
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.080]   there an information shortage?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.640]   Where is the advice and the information that's available not up to snuff, up to the level
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.780]   where it should be?
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:13.320]   And this is one of those areas where we can help you to protect yourself for a little
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   bit of time spent with us, a little bit of treasure spent with us, and then some time
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.440]   putting in place a new mindset and some new practices.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   So go to HackProofCourse.com today.
