[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380]   The pools are awesome at the montage in Maui.
[00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.700]   I want to say there's four tiers of pools.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.460]   There's like the adult pool and then three tiers of kids' pools
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.540]   with little waterfalls between them with rocks that kids can jump off of,
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.360]   weird little water features and multiple hot tubs,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.320]   shallow section for younger kids.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.020]   It was definitely more of a family vibe than some hotels I've stayed at,
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.100]   but we were there with our kids, so that was exactly what we were looking for.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.520]   And this was also true at the Four Seasons,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.720]   but like you never felt like there weren't chairs.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.340]   At the montage, they told us explicitly they had this policy.
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.900]   You could go down seven o'clock, you could sit in chairs,
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.240]   and if you don't use them by nine o'clock, you lose them.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.380]   I appreciated that they had a policy that was stated,
[00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.700]   but because there were not so many people there when we were there,
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760]   at least they had enough chairs for people.
