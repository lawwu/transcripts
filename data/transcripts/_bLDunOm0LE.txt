[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.840]   - Happy Monday morning, everyone.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.080]   Thank you for tuning in and for listening to the podcast
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.860]   as we move well into our 10th year now.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.700]   1,770 episodes in, this is episode 1,771.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.760]   Here we go, and it happens to be
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.440]   on the theme of shame of all things.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.840]   It's about healthy and needful shame,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.600]   if there is such a thing in the Christian life.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.560]   Here's the question.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.160]   Pastor John, hello, and thank you for this wonderful podcast.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.120]   My name is Philip, and I live in College Station, Texas.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.160]   I've noticed that a lot of Christians today
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.200]   equate shame with condemnation,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.080]   thereby believing it is wrong for Christians to feel shame.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.800]   But Paul calls for shame in 2 Thessalonians 3:14,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.440]   or so it seems to me.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.520]   So what healthy role does shame play
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   in the life of the church today,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.040]   and who here is the object of the shame,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.800]   according to Paul in this particular text?
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.160]   One of the reasons this is an important question
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.160]   is that we can sometimes fall into the trap of thinking,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.120]   well, if it's always good to move beyond shame,
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   then shame must always be a bad thing.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.320]   That would be a trap, I think.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.000]   That would be like saying,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.480]   since we should always seek healing
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.520]   from having our skin cut,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   therefore surgery is always a bad thing.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.320]   And you see the difference.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.480]   Having your skin cut by a knife
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.320]   is not in itself a good thing,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   and neither is shame in itself a good thing.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280]   But given the reality of disease,
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280]   being cut by a knife may become a kind of good thing
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   because of what it leads to, namely healing.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.960]   And that's the way it is, I think,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.880]   with shame in the New Testament.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.840]   Sometimes shame functions like surgery
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.360]   to bring us to the healing that we need.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.780]   But that doesn't mean that all shame has a healing function
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.880]   any more than all skin cutting leads to health.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.260]   There is surgery and there is stabbing.
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.200]   So we need to make distinctions,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.000]   and the Bible helps us do this.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.120]   So what Philip, in this question,
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.080]   is drawing our attention to
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   is the fact that there is a proper function
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   for shame in the New Testament,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.760]   a healing, sanctifying function,
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.220]   and he wonders what it is.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.160]   So let's follow the New Testament
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.200]   and draw out the distinction
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.920]   between what I have called misplaced shame
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   and well-placed shame.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.100]   So misplaced shame, the kind we should not have,
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.960]   and well-placed shame, the kind we should have,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   but only temporarily while it does its healing work.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   So here's some examples of what I mean by misplaced shame.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.080]   If you are tempted to feel this shame,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.740]   you should strive to throw it off by faith in Jesus.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.620]   Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord.
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.720]   This is 2 Timothy 1.8.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.840]   Do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.200]   or of me, his prisoner.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   So there are two kinds of things in that verse
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.760]   that you should not be ashamed of,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.400]   shouldn't feel shame about.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.740]   One, speaking about the Lord Jesus.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.920]   Two, being associated with somebody
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.280]   who's in prison for the Lord Jesus.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.480]   And it doesn't matter how many people
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   belittle you or make fun of you,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.220]   which shows us that for the Christian,
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.040]   the source of shame should not come
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.520]   from the false opinions of other people,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.640]   no matter how belittling they are.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   That takes a great deal of self-identity
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.240]   in and for Jesus to live through that.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.280]   Another example is when Jesus said,
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.960]   "Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.440]   in this adulterous and sinful generation,
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.540]   the Son of Man will be ashamed of him
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.800]   when he comes in the glory of his Father
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.480]   with the holy angels."
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   If human opinion is more emotionally powerful
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.760]   than God's opinion of us,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.200]   and if the power of human opinion cripples us
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.240]   and silences us with shame
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.600]   because we claim to be a Christian,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.720]   we're not gonna stand in the judgment, Jesus says.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.360]   And then Peter, in 1 Peter 4, 16 says,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.060]   "If anyone suffers as a Christian,
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.660]   let him not feel shame,
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.120]   but in that name, let him glorify God."
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.180]   So I conclude from these few texts, and there are others,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.720]   that the biblical criterion for misplaced shame,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.440]   the kind we should not have,
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   is don't feel shame for something that honors God
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   no matter how weak or foolish it makes you look
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.640]   in the eyes of others.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.200]   Now, what about well-placed shame,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.140]   namely the kind we ought to have, at least temporarily?
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.800]   Paul says to the Corinthians
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.860]   who were doubting the resurrection,
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   "Be sober-minded as you ought, stop sinning,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.240]   for some have no knowledge of God.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.960]   I speak this to your shame."
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.920]   That's 1 Corinthians 15, 34.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.720]   "They ought to feel shame," he's saying.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.200]   He says again, 1 Corinthians 6, 5,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.020]   when the Christians were disputing with each other
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.160]   and taking that dispute into the secular courts, he says,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.900]   "I say this to your shame.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.160]   Is there no one among you wise enough
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.260]   to be able to decide between the brothers?"
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.660]   Or the text that Philip, in his question, asked about,
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.980]   "If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter,"
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.540]   and these were people who were refusing to work
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.120]   in Thessalonica, refusing to work for a living
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.580]   because they thought the second coming was so near.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.780]   He says, "Take special note of that man
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.240]   and do not associate with him
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.660]   so that he may be put to shame."
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.520]   That's 2 Thessalonians 3, 14.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.180]   So shame is a proper and redemptive step
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.980]   toward repentance and healing.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.640]   And we see that in the very next verse.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.100]   He says, "Do not regard him as an enemy,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.760]   but warn him as a brother."
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.760]   In other words, the cut that you make in his skin
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.800]   by withdrawing your fellowship is surgery, not stabbing.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.780]   So from these examples,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.780]   I conclude that well-placed shame says
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.020]   you should feel shame for having a hand
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.080]   in anything that dishonors God,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.000]   no matter how strong or wise or right it may look
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.140]   in the eyes of men.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:01.340]   Now, when I say that we should feel shame
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.380]   if it is well-placed because of our wrongdoing,
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   I don't mean that we should feel shame indefinitely
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.940]   any more than we ought to spend the rest of our lives
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.220]   on the surgeon's operating table.
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.820]   I call it well-placed shame because it ought to be there,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.060]   but it ought not to stay there.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.180]   So the key question for both misplaced shame
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.180]   and well-placed shame is how do we properly move
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.120]   beyond both of them?
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.320]   How do we get rid of both of them?
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.400]   Now, before I give my basic biblical answer,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.320]   let me acknowledge that there are some people
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.320]   who have been dumped on with so much misplaced shaming
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.720]   perhaps when they were growing up,
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.560]   that their perspective is so distorted about God
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   and about themselves that they will need a lot of help
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.200]   from other Christians and perhaps counselors
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.800]   to see things clearly, like they really are.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.120]   In other words, I'm not claiming that the escape
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.320]   from misplaced shame is always easy.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.680]   In fact, I would say it's rarely easy,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   but there is a way out of both misplaced shame
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.360]   that shouldn't be there and well-placed shame
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.720]   that shouldn't be there long
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.960]   or in any crippling way for the Christian.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.520]   And here's what Paul says about the way
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.360]   he escapes misplaced shame.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   Even though he endures mockery and imprisonment for Christ,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.840]   which ordinarily would be very shaming,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   he says, "I am not ashamed,
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   "for I know whom I have believed,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.000]   "and I am convinced that he is able to guard unto that day
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.480]   "what has been entrusted to me."
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.720]   So there's the key phrase.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.960]   I know whom I have believed,
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.960]   trusted, embraced, treasured, bowed to, love.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.920]   The key for Paul is believing.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.800]   That is, he sees the glory of Christ.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.400]   He embraces the glory of Christ and he treasures it
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   more than the opinions and persecutions of people.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.680]   That's the key, seeing and savoring
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.680]   and treasuring, believing Christ.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:47.000]   And with regard to putting away well-placed shame,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.800]   it's the same key, believing,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.680]   believing in Christ for the forgiveness
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   of what you are ashamed of, Acts 10.43.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   Through his name, everyone who believes
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   is forgiven for his sins.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.240]   Let me give one more glorious promise
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.280]   from God that covers both cases
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   of misplaced shame and well-placed shame,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.600]   so that we can get rid of both of them
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   appropriately, quickly.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.960]   Here's Isaiah 45,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   17, "You, namely you who believe,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.400]   you will not be put to shame
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   or humiliated to all eternity."
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   Which Paul then applies to Christians
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.480]   with these words, Romans 10, 11,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480]   "No one who believes in him will be put to shame."
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:02.120]   No one finally will be shamed in the kingdom of God.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.680]   It will be over.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.440]   - Very good word, biblical, honest,
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.760]   and applied with pastoral care.

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.600]   He does, he makes much of us.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.960]   But why, why does God make much of us?
