[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   At Facebook, there were all these posters up on the wall of the office, very
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.280]   elaborate, beautifully designed posters for like a talk that someone was coming
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.360]   to give at Facebook.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.720]   And it's like, why did somebody put all this effort into it?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.080]   Like, well, it feels really good because a poster is this really constrained.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.120]   It's like finite, it's ephemeral.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.560]   You can start it and within a few hours, like, yeah, there's a search space, but
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.480]   you can find a decent part of the search space pretty rapidly.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.200]   And once you're there, there's this beautiful and very enticing feeling of
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.720]   turning the crank and like making it better and polishing it and trying this
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160]   or that, but when you're trying this or that, like, all of the options are kind
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.040]   of okay, and you're kind of trying them out of curiosity, or like, maybe it can
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.960]   be even better.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.680]   And that's very different from the kind of design where you're just like, I
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.960]   simply don't know how to do this.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.600]   And I think it's part of why those designers loved making those posters.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.100]   It's a snack, it's a treat.
