[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   This week, John Piper's new book launches.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.520]   It's titled Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.800]   It's a trim 150-page book published
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.300]   as a nice little hardcover by our friends
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.720]   at the Good Book Company in England,
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.400]   available now on Amazon, and of course,
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.440]   the full digital book can be downloaded at DesiringGod.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.600]   Pastor John, on this podcast,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.940]   we often talk about fighting sin on two fronts.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.700]   There's an external front of shielding our lives
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.320]   from certain influences, and then there's the internal front
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.000]   of filling our heart with God's glory.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.040]   In the struggles against the sinful use
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.080]   of money, sex, and power,
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.920]   these things can seem far more powerful
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.100]   and more dominating in real life experience
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.280]   than the holy affections of Christ, as you well know.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.880]   What would you say to a young believer
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.880]   who feels this is the case?
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.540]   Are you saying that God's glory is more powerful
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.160]   than the lure of internet pornography, for example?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.840]   How do you quantify the competing pleasures of the flesh
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.480]   and the expulsive power of a new affection?
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.920]   Speak to a doubter who doesn't believe
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.280]   the pleasures in God is stronger
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.440]   than the allure of pornography.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.280]   - Wow.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.560]   That question
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.960]   really
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560]   captures my,
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440]   I really wanna figure this out.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   I mean, I get the difference between the powers of sex
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.600]   and the power of spiritual ecstasies.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.680]   Those are not the same.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800]   So I've got lots to say about this.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800]   Where shall I start?
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.880]   Whenever we talk about money, sex, and power,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.840]   sex always seems to be in a class by itself.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.760]   And the reason for that
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.000]   is the physical dimension of the desire.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.420]   That makes the desire for sex intense and powerful
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.240]   in a way that the desire for money and power do not.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   I'm sure that the desire for money,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.880]   some activity or toy or privilege that money can buy,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   may have a physical dimension to it.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   But I doubt that desire for money and desire for power
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   ever becomes as overpowering
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.160]   in their physical dimension as sex does.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.040]   So my guess is that when a new believer
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.920]   or an immature believer compares the power of sex
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.860]   to the power of the beauty of Christ,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.860]   these can feel like totally different kinds of attraction.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.360]   And the question becomes whether the kind of attraction
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   that the beauty of Christ has
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.640]   can really counter the kind of attraction
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.400]   that sexual hormones create.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.960]   And I see that distinction.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.800]   It's a real distinction.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   The spiritual joys, even ecstasies,
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.920]   which we can know in personal relation with Christ
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.240]   are in fact not the same physical kind
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.200]   as we taste in sexual craving.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.960]   So when I say that the expulsive power
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   of a new desire for Christ
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   can drive out the controlling power of old sinful desires,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.920]   I realize that this is a battle
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.840]   not between two pleasures measured on the same scale.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.160]   One pleasure is dominantly physical, not only,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.940]   and the other pleasure is dominantly spiritual,
[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.680]   not only, but dominantly.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.300]   And this creates a problem for a new believer
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.680]   or an immature believer
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   because spiritual pleasures are so new to them
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.380]   and their capacities for these pleasures
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.380]   may be so undeveloped that they can scarcely imagine
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.600]   that a godly spiritual pleasure could be intense enough
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.920]   to conquer an ungodly physical pleasure.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.440]   And another difference between these combatants
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   is that the desire for sex gets its power
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.360]   from an immediate, narrow, focused,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.640]   visible or touchable sensation,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   but the desire for Christ and the enjoyment of Christ
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.780]   is not that way.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.320]   It's not narrow in the same way.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.400]   It's the pleasures that we have in knowing Christ
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   are larger in their focus, deeper in the soul,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.680]   more lasting and durable,
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.280]   taking in more of your personality
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   instead of just focusing on your body,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.740]   and more personal and more relational.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.960]   And this means that the cultivation
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.520]   of the controlling power of the pleasures
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   that we have in Christ,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.800]   in other words, the effort to make them
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.880]   the controlling pleasures happens over time.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.160]   It doesn't just happen in that little moment there
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.440]   while we're facing the battle.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.480]   While the sexual pleasures are arriving,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.180]   bang, with such enormous force,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.180]   which means that the warfare of pleasure against pleasure
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.600]   is not simply fought in the moment of immediate combat,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.000]   but over time as we attempt to go deeper and deeper
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.680]   in our knowledge of Christ and our dependence on Christ
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   and our enjoyment of Christ.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.680]   For example, the shield of faith that Paul says quenches
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.920]   the fiery darts of the evil one.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.920]   Maybe they happen to be sexual and flaming darts this time.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.040]   That shield is not something you leave in your arsenal
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.400]   and only whip out when the arrows are flying.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.720]   The shield of faith represents a daily,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.400]   ongoing cultivation of growing knowledge
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.920]   and growing trust and growing delight
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.640]   in our friend and king and savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.960]   hour by hour, day by day, week by week,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.760]   month by month, growing the effectiveness of this shield
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   when the arrows happen to fly.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   So let me try to illustrate practically
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.120]   what I'm talking about,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.440]   but the growing and the intensification
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   of this counter desire of spiritual pleasure
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.080]   over against the immediacy of the physical pleasure.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   Basically, the idea is every day we fix our attention
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.160]   on the beauty of Christ in the way he deals with money
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   and the beauty of Christ in the way he deals with sex
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.120]   and the beauty of Christ in the way he deals with power.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.960]   And the biblical principle is that beholding,
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.720]   I'm getting this from 2 Corinthians 3, 18,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   beholding, looking at the peculiar glory of Christ,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.760]   we are transformed into his likeness
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.280]   so that his beauty in relation to money
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.880]   becomes our beauty in relation to money
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.080]   and his beauty in relation to sex,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   our beauty in relation to sex
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.960]   and his beauty in relation to power,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.440]   our beauty in relation to power.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.400]   So here's how it works for me.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.720]   I'll just give you concrete strategies
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   that John Piper tries to follow.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   When I drink in the word about Jesus
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.780]   being so unencumbered by possessions
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.740]   that he had no place to lay his head,
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.740]   my amazement at his poverty, poverty that made many rich,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.080]   moves me, it moves me, it shapes me,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.520]   it frees me from my love affair with money, I admire it.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.640]   And when he says, "Foxes have holes
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.000]   "and birds of the air have nests,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.120]   "but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head,"
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.840]   I love him, I love his simplicity,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.320]   I love his freedom from the love of money,
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   I love his readiness to risk all for the mission.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.520]   And when Paul says, "Though he was rich,
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.320]   "yet for your sake he became poor,"
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.280]   so that by his poverty he could make many rich,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.960]   I see him, I love him, I'm drawn to him,
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.800]   and I find him giving himself to me.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.220]   And his freedom from money
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.640]   starts to give me freedom from money,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   and his vastly more admirable beauty
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   so far surpasses the tycoons of Wall Street.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.920]   Why would I wanna be like one of them?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.760]   He's so free, so loving, so bold, so sacrificial.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.100]   Everything about him is more attractive
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.000]   than all the rich people I've ever known.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.520]   So that's the way it works for me.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.360]   Beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.520]   I am changed into a person who doesn't love money.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.360]   That's the way it works.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.160]   Or let's take sex, for example.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.200]   When I look at Jesus' sexual life, same thing happens.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.120]   Decades, three decades of, well, maybe two,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.160]   of masculine virility.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.580]   He had an adolescence, I presume, a puberty.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.580]   So one and a half or two decades of masculine virility,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.640]   yet not one single millisecond
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.640]   of a sinful thought or feeling or immoral act.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.680]   Women were hanging on his words, following him around.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.120]   Former prostitutes wept over him
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.680]   and wiped his bare feet with their hair.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.020]   He lived a life from one angle
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.020]   that you could say was supercharged with sexual temptation,
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.000]   and he never sinned.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   He never once committed any lustful thought or act.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.740]   He denied himself perfectly
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.060]   without denying the goodness of sexuality.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.820]   I watch him, and as I watch him, I love him.
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.100]   I admire him.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.820]   I stand in awe of his purity of mind and body,
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.180]   and I find myself in that admiration,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.340]   hating my own little compromises,
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.740]   and I find myself longing to be pure
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.300]   and to be found holy at the last day
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.340]   and above reproach and glorious in purity,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.340]   and his purity sexually is contagious.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.060]   Or here it is, here's the way I do it with power.
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.340]   Just recently I did this.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.020]   You can do it in lots of ways,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.320]   but when I looked at him in Gethsemane recently,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.500]   and he said to his disciples
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.220]   that chopped off an ear to save him,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.220]   do you not think that I cannot appeal to my father,
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.400]   and he will at once give me more than 12 legions of angels?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.100]   Well, now, a legion is about 3,000 soldiers.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.540]   12 legions is 36,000.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.580]   36,000 angels would be enough to rescue him,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.860]   and he says, "I can do this.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.200]   "That's power.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.560]   "That is power," and he didn't do it.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   He walked into the jaws of the lion,
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.740]   and he was killed.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.580]   Why?
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.540]   Why did he use power that way?
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.940]   And it's so glorious.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.020]   It's so beautiful.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.420]   It's so loving.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.540]   It's so kind.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.020]   It's so self-denying.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.140]   It makes me say, "I wanna use power that way.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.720]   "I wanna lay it down for the cause of love,
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.620]   "or I wanna turn it for the good of others
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.100]   "the way he did."
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.340]   So to the young believer, or the immature believer,
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.100]   or the doubting believer, I would empathize with you
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.260]   that the power of sex in the moment of temptation
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:15.140]   seems stronger, largely because it's physical,
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.060]   and greed and craving look so powerful,
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.860]   when you wanna crave to look cool,
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.980]   or crave to be powerful.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.680]   They look so powerful in the moment,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.420]   but I would plead with you to believe and to pursue.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.380]   Christ has depths and heights and unexpected dimensions
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.580]   of pleasure for you,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.920]   that if you will go hard after him day in and day out,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   these dimensions of pleasure will transform your life,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.460]   and they will pull the power plug
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.980]   on those sinful temptations.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:53.960]   - Brilliantly helpful.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
