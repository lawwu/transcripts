[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.920]   that chapter which we read at the beginning, the first epistle of Peter in the fourth chapter,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.840]   and reading again the first five verses, the first five verses in the fourth chapter of
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.080]   the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.400]   Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.840]   the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin, that he no
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.440]   longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.280]   will of God.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.440]   For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.240]   when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banqueting, and abominable
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.960]   idolatries; wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.800]   of riot, speaking evil of you, who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   quick and the dead.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.960]   Now here we are meeting on the first Sunday night of a new year.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:28.880]   Of course, in one sense that is a completely irrelevant fact, and yet if we only use it
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.760]   properly, it can be a very useful, a very important, and a very significant fact.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.160]   But we must use it in the right way.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.640]   Surely there is nothing which is quite so sad, so pathetic about the world, as the way
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.480]   in which it uses, or perhaps I should have said abuses, special occasions such as this,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   Christmas, the coming of a new year.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.480]   We have seen it again this year, as we see it year after year.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.560]   The way, I say, the sad way in which the world abuses these special times and seasons in
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   our lives in this world year by year.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   Now I don't want to stay with this, but there are two things that always strike me about
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   the way in which the world faces these occasions, Christmas and New Year in particular.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:39.440]   The first is this, the extraordinary readiness of the world to fool itself and to bluff itself.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.080]   Isn't this an amazing thing?
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.600]   How the world can persuade itself that there is some unusual spirit of goodwill about at
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.560]   Christmas time, and how it can persuade itself that somehow, because we pull down an old
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.360]   calendar and put up another one, that things are going to be different.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.800]   After all, they say it's a new year, you know, all the difference in the world between five
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.640]   to twelve and five past twelve midnight.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.360]   The world seems to be able to bluff itself, to fool itself, to rouse itself, and to persuade
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.920]   itself that somehow or another, this is going to make some vital and material difference
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.560]   to them.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.200]   And the result is, of course, that the world behaves as it does.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.920]   To borrow some of the words that are found in my text tonight, it's excessive riot.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.960]   That's how it celebrates these things, that's how it faces them.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I say it's just a part of the way in which the world can bluff itself and delude itself
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.640]   and rarely fool itself.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.640]   Is there anything that is so sad about the human race as its capacity for doing just
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.440]   that very thing?
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.160]   But of course, still more serious in many ways is the thing that accompanies that, the
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.480]   second thing to which I'm adverting hurriedly in passing.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   And that is the way in which the world, while it does all that, obstinately persists in
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.120]   its refusal to listen to, or to pay any attention to, the one thing that can really help it.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.320]   Oh, I don't want to condemn the world.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.560]   I'm talking about the tragedy of the world.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.920]   I'm saying that there's nothing which is so pathetic as this.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   The world in its trouble, clutching at any straw, working up something that has no existence,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.440]   lashing itself up into a state and a condition in order to find some relief, in order to
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.480]   feel a little bit of happiness and of joy.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.920]   Poor old world.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.600]   There isn't much joy in it, is there?
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.640]   There isn't much happiness.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.720]   It's a world of confusion and of trouble, of tragedy on all ends.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.600]   And then so the world, I say, tries to give itself a little relief.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.640]   And yet while it's doing all that, it will not even consider the one and only thing that
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.040]   really can help it, the only thing that really could put it right.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.080]   It's here facing it.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   It's been here facing it throughout the running centuries.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.240]   But the world won't look at it.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.200]   As we are told here, wherein they think it strange that he run not with them to the same
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.000]   excess of riots, speaking evil of you.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.080]   It won't look at it.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   It ridicules it.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.240]   It says, "Don't bother about that.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   What's that got to say?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Chapel, church, Bible."
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.520]   Remote, played out, belonging to the past.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.240]   And so you see the world at one and the same time does these two things.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   It fools itself with its illusions, though it knows that nothing ever comes of them,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   year after year, still goes on doing it.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   And yet while doing that, here is this one thing which really could change everything
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.240]   and put everything right.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.240]   But the world will not pay attention to it.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Well now, my friends, let's take advantage of this opportunity, therefore, of looking
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   at this thing which the world is spurning and which it so despises.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   Oh, thank God that at inner it we've come so far as to consider it and to look at it
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.240]   and to listen to it.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   That's a great thing, you know.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   When you're in the house of God, you're in a very special place.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   This is not a mere collection of men and women.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   There's something more here.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   We have a gracious and a very wonderful promise which tells us where two or three are gathered
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.240]   together in my name, there am I, in the midst.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   The Son of God said that, and he never breaks his promise.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.240]   He never goes back on his word.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   He is in this meeting, and he is here in all the glory of his divine saviourhood and personality.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.240]   And he is here full of those gracious promises.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:17.240]   Oh, that some needy soul might meet with him tonight and find in experience, experimentally,
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.240]   that what he offers is effect into reality.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   This is the wonderful thing, you know, about meeting in the house of God and considering
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   the Christian gospel.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   You never know what's going to happen.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   "The souls who came to scuff remained to pray."
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   Men and women who came in in one condition went out in another.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   This is what's been happening throughout the running centuries.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   The Apostle Peter is writing here to people, you see, who at one time lived this kind of life.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:57.240]   In walking in lasciviousness, lusts, excessive wine, revelings, banqueting, abominable idolatries.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   But they were no longer like that.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   Peter's writing to them because they were no longer like that.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   They'd been delivered out of all that, and they'd been delivered from that by the preaching of this gospel.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.240]   This same gospel, this old message which I'm preaching to you tonight.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.240]   The whole condition of these men had been revolutionized.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.240]   They were now the saints of God.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.240]   They were now adorning the Christian church, and they've got this blessed hope ahead of them.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   They've been received of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:35.240]   What Peter calls here, "The manifold grace of God."
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Very well. Now let's look at this message.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   "Praying and trusting that those who are in this congregation,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   who hitherto have known nothing about this kind of thing, may know it this very night,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   and may go out of this service rejoicing in a manner that they've never known hitherto."
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   Well now, what has it got to say?
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   Well, here is the right way of looking at life and all that happens to us in life.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   How do we do so?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   Well, let me take up some of the phrases that are used in our text.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   Here is the first.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   "The rest of his time."
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   He says, "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin,
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:25.240]   that he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   but to the will of God."
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   Didn't this phrase strike you?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   "The rest of his time in the flesh."
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   Now then, what is this? What is this time that he's talking about?
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   Well, you might translate it if you like, "might live the rest of his life in the flesh."
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   But what is life?
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   Is there anything more important than that we should be right in our way of looking at and assessing the future?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   January the 1st, 1961, the first day of a new year.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   We are all looking into the future.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   But what is there so important as that we should rightly assess the future
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   and know exactly the way to look at it?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   In other words, let me put this question, what is our life in this world?
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   How is one to regard it?
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   What are we to make of it?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   What should be my attitude towards my own personal life at this moment?
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   How rarely do we stop to do that and to consider what it's all about.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   And that is, of course, because the world will not allow us to do that.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   It's never been more difficult in this world just to stop and think and to ask the first great question,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   what is life? What is my time in this world? What is it?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   The world keeps us so busy.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   Papers, books, radio, television, every conceivable thing to take a man out of himself.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.240]   And we spend the whole of our time in looking everywhere except at ourselves.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   And this is the supreme tragedy, isn't it, that it's possible for men and women to go through life in this world
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   and never ask themselves this question, what is life?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   What am I? What is all this about?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:29.240]   Now that is the kind of question which the Bible tells us we should always be starting with.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   And all I want to do this evening is to put very simply before you at Inuit this aspect of the matter,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   the time aspect.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.240]   You don't blame me for doing that, do you? Well, we're all doing it.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   We say this is 1961, new calendars are up.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.240]   All right, well, now that means we are talking about time,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   and we are interested in time, and we are dividing time.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   And it's very right that we should do so.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   But we must go on beyond that and divide up the whole of our life.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   And how can it be divided?
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   Well, according to this teaching, the way to divide life is this.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   What is life? Well, here it is.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   Time past. It's in the next verse.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   Verse 3, "For the time past of our life should suffice us, may suffice us, to have wrought the will of the Gentiles."
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   All right, I'll take up that phrase.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.240]   The time past of our life.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.240]   Here am I standing in this pulpit on January 1, 1961.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.240]   What's my life? Well, I'll divide it like this.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   Time past. 1960, 1959, 1958, 1957.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   Back and back I go to that day when I was born.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   Now there's the time past of my life.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   It's gone. I've lived it.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   It's a reality. It's a fact.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   There is a sector, a section of my life that I have lived.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.240]   I can't go back and live it again. It's gone.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   I can never retrieve it.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   The time past of my life.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   And there's a time past in your life.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   Well, let's come to the second division.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   What's that? Well, it's the present.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   This moment.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.240]   This very hour that we are now here in this chapel.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   We are here now.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.240]   Well, here it is. This is the present.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   Very well, but then we come to the third division.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.240]   And what is that? And here it is.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   It is the rest of our time.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   The rest of our life.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   And you know the whole of life is divided up in that way.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   That is the total. That is the lot.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:46.240]   The time past, the present, the rest.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.240]   But we can't leave it at that, can we?
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.240]   You know, this rest of our time, this rest of our life,
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   oh, it tells us a great deal, doesn't it?
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   It tells us this, you see.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   If there is a rest of my time in this world,
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   it means of necessity that there is a definite length to my time in this world.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.240]   There's a definite limit.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   If I can say past, present, and the rest,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   it must mean that there is a definite total.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.240]   And I've taken off that much of the total.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   I'm here at the moment.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.240]   Well, that's all that's left. There is a rest.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   But it is the rest in a very definite total.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   It is the rest of a limited section of time that has been allotted to me.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   So much has gone.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   So much remains.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   And only so much.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   And there it is, described as the rest of your time.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   How much is this?
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.240]   Ah, there's the rub.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   We don't know, do we?
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   But you know, it's definitely determined.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   God knows.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   There is an allotted spend to every one of us.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   There is a time to every man.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   There is a definite portion of time.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   So here we find ourselves tonight on January the 1st, 1961.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   The time past, it's gone.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   The present moment.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   And the rest of our time.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   Is there anything in this world that is quite so difficult as just to realize that?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   What can we do to remind ourselves of this?
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   My friend, it's true of every one of us in this congregation at this moment.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   There is for you a certain limited portion of time, the rest of your time.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   And that's all there is.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   I almost feel that it would be a good thing for all of us
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   to go back and do something that was done to us as when we were children and when we were taught to count.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   And to add and to subtract. You remember they used to have beads.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   And there they were on a steel bar or a bit of tin or something.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   And you had all the beads on that side, ten of them if you like.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.240]   And then you moved one over. Nine left.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.240]   You moved another over. Eight left.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   Another over. Seven left.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   And as you go on adding to this side, you're subtracting from that side.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   You know, that's life.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   We've gone a long time past. We've subtracted from what? From a total.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   We are moving one over at this moment.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   Ah yes, but you see, there's only a given number left.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   I think there'd be nothing more valuable in life
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   than that every one of us every morning should have something like that.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   And we move over a bead and say, "Another day has gone."
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   That means there's a day less coming.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   Oh, but you see, this is utter morbidity. Morbidity.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.240]   This is realism. This is truth. This is fact. This is life.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   A man who doesn't face this is a madman.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   Shall I put it in another form?
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   Let me try another illustration in order to impress this truth.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   I remember once how it fell to my lot to be having tea
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   with a man who was a very well-known and quite famous tenor singer.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   He was a well-known soloist.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   And I was having tea with this man,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   and I don't remember quite how the conversation got to this point,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   but I remember mentioning certain portions of music to him,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   and one in particular which had a very high note.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   And I said, "Do you feel at all nervous as you come to that part of that particular aria,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.240]   when you know you've got to strike that note?"
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   "Well," he said, "I wouldn't so much say that I feel nervous as I approach it."
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   "I'll tell you how I approach this and how all tenors approach this."
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   "Well," I said, "what is it?"
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   "Well," he said, "we look at it like this.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:18.240]   We say that every man has got a given number and a given number only of top C."
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:23.240]   And he says, "This is what I feel every time I sing that or anything else that has that note.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   Every time I hit that note, I say to myself, 'Another one has gone.'"
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   All right, the man was very serious.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   He knew that there was a time limit to the power of his throat,
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   to the capacity of his larynx,
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   and every time he used one of these precious notes,
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   there was one less to be used.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   And our life is like that.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   The rest of your time.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   Time past, present, the rest of your time.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   And I say, "I don't know," but you see, that's a part of the consideration that the Bible puts before us.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   It is because we don't know that we should think so seriously.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   And I therefore leave this by asking my question,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   "Have you realized until this minute
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   that there is only this limited portion of time left for you in this life and in this world?"
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   Because whether we like it or not, it is a simple fact.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   The rest of your time.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   It may only be an hour, it may be a day, it may be a month, it may be a year,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   it may be ten years, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, I don't care how far you go.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   There's an end, there's a limit.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.240]   The rest of your time.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   You know, the moment you enter into this world, you're beginning to subtract.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.240]   One day less.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   One year less.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   One decade less.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   And the man who lives is born to die.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   Life is a great process of subtraction.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Past, present, rest of your time.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Well, now then, in the light of that, let us go on to the second great consideration.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   If this is true, and it is true, the second principle is this.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   That we therefore ought to be very seriously concerned as to how we are going to spend the rest of our time.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   That's what he's saying.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin."
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.240]   That he should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   All right, I've only got a limited time, and here's my question.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   How am I to live it?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   How am I to use it?
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   That's all I've got.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   What am I to make of it?
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.240]   Now this is the very question I say that the world never faces.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   The world just goes on.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   Thinking about circumstances and chance, and accidents and possibilities.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   Oh, that's nonsense. That's folly.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   Here's the question to ask.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.240]   I've only got this limited amount of time.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   What am I going to do with it?
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   Now then, listen to what we are told here.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   Because the teaching is, first, that there are only two possible ways of using it.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   And only two.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   A man can either live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, or else to the will of God.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   And there are no alternatives.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:25.240]   We are either going to live to the will of God, or else we are not going to live to the will of God.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   Well, now let's take that second one first.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   He says, "the lusts of men," and he puts it later like this.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   He says, "the time past of your life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles."
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   The will of the Gentiles.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   The lusts of men.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   What does he mean by this?
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   Well, if you like, that's the way of the world.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   So the first way of spending the rest of our time is to live it and to spend it entirely apart from God.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   That our whole outlook shall be governed by the ideas and the wills of men.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   He talks about the Gentiles, and he mentions the Gentiles for this reason.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.240]   The ancient world, you see, was divided up into the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   The Jews were the people of God, and they'd got the law of God, and they were aware of what God had said.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   Now that's one way of living, but there was this other way, the way of the Gentiles.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   And they were pagans, they were godless, they had a multiplicity of gods, and they used their own ideas and imaginations.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   Well, there it is, the will of the Gentiles, the will of men, the lusts of men.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   That's one way in which you can live, that is a way that so many millions in the world are living tonight.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.240]   But let's look at it, let's examine it. What are its characteristics?
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   Well, the first characteristic is that it is entirely without any spiritual content.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   Here he says in verse 4, wherein they, these people who are living that sort of life, think it strange
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   that ye run not with them still to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   He says these other people, amongst whom you once were, and you used to live their life and share it with them,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   they're surprised that you're not still doing it, they think it's strange, they don't understand you.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   They say, "Why are you so different? Why aren't you still joining with us?
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   Why have you gone from us, and why are you living in that different way?"
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   They think it's strange, they don't understand it.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.240]   And why don't they understand it?
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   The answer is, of course, that they are spiritually dead.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   And they have no spiritual light and no spiritual understanding whatsoever.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   They're without God, without hope, and without God in the world.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   "What do you mean?" says somebody. "Well, I mean this."
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   You see, they never have any thought about the soul.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:04.240]   They never realize the truth about themselves as men, that they've got souls or spirits within them.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   They think of themselves as animals, reasoning animals, clever animals, but nothing more than animals.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   No thought of the soul, no thought of God.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   God doesn't enter into their calculation.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   They live as if there were no God.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   They're entirely without God.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   They're living entirely according to the will of men, the will of the Gentiles.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   In other words, their outlook upon life is that it's something that's entirely confined to this world.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   They know of nothing beyond it, they never think of that.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   "Oh," they say, "what do we know about it? In any case, there's no time, death will come soon enough.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.240]   Just let's live for the moment, eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   But they never think of death and what lies beyond it, they never think of eternity.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   They never consider the unseen realm at all.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   They're always looking at the seen, at the present, the things that they can buy and handle and touch,
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   houses, refrigerators, televisions, decorations in Regenstriet.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.240]   "Ah, these are tangible things," they say, "and they live for these," and they never think of anything else.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:16.240]   They're absolutely bound by earth, by time, by man.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   They know nothing at all about the spiritual realm.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   And if a friend of theirs happens to be converted and become a Christian, they say he's gone queer,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   there's something the matter with him.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   He's not doing what he used to do. He's always talking about these unseen things.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   It means nothing to them. Why?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   Well, as Paul says, "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   neither can he for they are spiritually discerned."
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   Oh, what a terrible thing it is to be living a life that is bound by this world, man, the earth, time only.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   There's its general characteristic.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   What are the manifestations of that kind of life?
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   How do people who have such views of life, how do they live?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   Well, here's the terrible answer given here.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   "The time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries."
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   Oh, I needn't stay with that, because the world is still living that sort of life.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   That's how they've been celebrating Christmas.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   That's how they were celebrating the coming of a new year last night, wasn't it?
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   It's a wonderful thing to joke about whiskey. Isn't it marvelous?
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   Whiskey, and more and more whiskey.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   They gloat in it, they burst of it, they think it's wonderful,
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   and they work up an atmosphere of brightness and of good.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   This is life. But look at it, look at its character.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   "The lusts of men."
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   It's a life of lusts, my friend.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   Men given a mind by God, being controlled by appetites, desires, cravings, inordinate affections,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   no discipline, riot, excess.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   These are the terms that are used not only here by the Apostle Peter, but in other epistles.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.240]   You'll find it in Ephesians 4 and 5, and in other places.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   That is the typical description of this worldly life of men.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   And it needn't always be very violent, you know.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   It needn't always be in rags, it can be very polite.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.240]   But it's lust.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   Some men have a lust for drink and other, and for the lung, lust for sex and flesh.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   Ah, but there are men who have lusts for learning and for knowledge,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   and for positions and honors, and money and status.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   The same lust.
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   And you're seeing it on all hand at the present time as men and women turn their backs upon God.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   It's a life of lust and of riot, excess, no discipline.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   And what is the result of it all?
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   Well, you notice how he puts it, "The time past of your life, surely," he says,
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   "may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles."
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   He says, "Is it conceivable that you as Christians should turn with any longing in your eye and look at that sort of thing?
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   Surely you've spent enough time doing that sort of thing."
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   Why? Well, because it is what it is.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   It's an utter waste. It's unprofitable.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   It doesn't lead to anything. It's of no good. It's of no value to anybody.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.240]   It only leads to pain, to heartbreak, to the breakdown of all the sanctities.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   It robs men of his chastity and of his purity and of his honesty.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   There's nothing uplifting, nothing ennobling.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   It's always taking away, it's draining, this excess that exhausts.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   "The time past of your life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles."
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   Can any man who's ever really looked at that sort of life feel any desire to go on with such a life?
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   No, no, you've spent too long already in it. Give it up. Turn away from it.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   It's a totally profitless existence.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Well, there is one possibility, the life according to men and according to the Gentile.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   But there is another way. Listen.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   The life that is lived according to the will of God and according to the will of Christ.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   He should no longer live the rest of his life in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   Now let's look at this other type of life that is held before us in the Scriptures.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   What is this life? What are the characteristics of this life?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   Well, this is a life that is revealed to us by God, not men.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   This isn't what man thinks, it's what God thinks.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   It's a life that we'd know nothing about if God hadn't revealed it to us.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   We know the other type of life.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   Men think it up, they invent new games, new pleasures, new ways of exciting themselves.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   And it's man's ingenuity, man's invention. This isn't, this is God.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   This is something that is revealed in God's book and in God's law.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:26.240]   What is it? Well, you see, it's the exact opposite of the one I've been talking about.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   This is entirely spiritual.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   This is a view of men as a creature made in the image of God.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   Not an animal, not a collection of lusts and passions and desires, but man made in the image of God.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.240]   Man was meant to be the friend of God.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   Man with a soul and a spirit that are bigger than his body and bigger than the whole world.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Man, yes, as one I say deliberately, was bigger than this world, because he's only a pilgrim in it.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   This isn't the only world. It's a temporary world, it's a passing world.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   It's a world in which a man is a stranger and a pilgrim.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   Peter's already been saying that to these people in the second chapter.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   He says, "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul."
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   Strangers and pilgrims.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   This is not the only world, it's not the only life.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Man is a stranger here.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   He comes, he lives, he goes.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   Yes, time past, present, rest of the time, and then on into an unseen, eternal, spiritual realm.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   That's what this other view tells us.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   That life in this world is only a preparation for the life that is to come beyond the veil.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.240]   That doesn't detract from this world.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   That doesn't derogate in any sense from the glories of this world and the possibilities.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   But it does say this, that this world at its best is a mere preparation for that other world, that endless world, that is lying out of sight beyond us.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   That is God's revelation with regard to men and with regard to men's life in this world.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   Very well, what sort of life do people live who hold that view of life?
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   Well, here it is. Look at the first verse.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind."
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   What mind? Well, the mind of Christ.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   This is the characteristic of this life.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   Here is a life that is lived as the Lord Jesus Christ lived it.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   What's the characteristic of his life?
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   Well, he didn't live to satisfy his lusts, his desires and passions.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   No, no.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   The great characteristic of his life was this, that he lived to do the will of God.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   He said so.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   "I am come to do the will of him that sent me."
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.240]   That was his guiding star, the law of God, the will of God.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   Not what he wanted.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   "There he is in the garden of Gethsemane, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   He was tempted in all points, like as we are, yet he never sinned. Why?
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   Well, because there was discipline in his life, there was control.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   But still more important, it wasn't a life, I say, of just the gratification of his own lusts and desires.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   It was a life of thinking of others.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   "For as much then as Christ hath suffered for us."
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   Peter has been saying that. Listen to chapter 2, 24.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed."
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   You see, he wasn't living for himself and saying, "What can I get out of it?
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   More money, more drink, more food, more sex, all for me. Let's have my fill."
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   Let everybody else look after themselves. No, no. He didn't consider himself.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   "For Christ hath suffered for us."
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   He came into this world, he says it again in chapter 3, 18,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.240]   that he might bring us to God."
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   He didn't live to please himself. He lived to do the will of God. He lived for us.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   He sacrificed himself, he gave himself.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   "Arm yourselves likewise with the same minds," says Peter.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   This is the way to live. Not just taking all along, but giving, sacrificing, self-abasement.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:26.240]   And what does this kind of life lead to?
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   Oh, the valuable nature of this life.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   A life of helping others.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   A life of giving a helping hand to the suffering and the weak,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.240]   and those who are sinful and forlorn. He gave himself. He died.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   This is the characteristic of the life.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:53.240]   Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   The world is as it is tonight.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.240]   Because men and women are not living this life, they are living according to the will of men,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.240]   and they are not living to the will of the Gentiles.
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   "It's mine, I must have it, I want it."
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   That's why marriage goes, that's why everything goes,
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   that's why nations are piling up their armaments, wanting this competition, greed, I and the other.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   Now, my friends, the rest of your life in this world can be spent in one of these two ways.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   You can either go on living the sort of life with which we are all so familiar,
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   or you can live like the Lord Jesus Christ lived, to the glory of God, to the ennobling of men,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   standing as a great figure above all animal creation, the friend of God,
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   in communion with the Heavenly Father, and doing good, and sacrificing,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   and lifting up the whole of life and the whole of man.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   It's one or the other.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   That's the first consideration he puts before us.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.240]   But let me add a second consideration very briefly.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   You, I say, can live one of those two ways of life, but remember this,
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   that there is a very definite end to it, whichever way you're going to live,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:16.240]   and that at the end there comes a judgment.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   Listen to verse 5, "Who shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead?"
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   Oh, Peter goes on saying it, "Time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   and if it first begin at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel?
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?"
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   You know the business of preaching is to confront people with facts,
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   and these are the facts.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:59.240]   I have only a short time left in this world, the rest of my time,
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   and then I die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   And it's absolutely certain, it is inevitable, it is unavoidable,
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   everybody shall stand before him, the quick, those who are still alive, and the dead.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   There is to be an end of time, not only my time, but the whole of time, the whole of human history.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   Christ is coming back into this world, and he'll come back to judgment.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.240]   And how will he judge us?
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   Well, he'll judge us entirely on this principle as to how we have spent our time in this world.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:52.240]   "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   These are the solemn words of Scripture that I feel constrained to hold before you this first Sunday night of this new year.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   Listen to this.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.240]   It's in the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation,
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   outside are the dogs and those that have work abominations, they're outside.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   He is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   This is how you should think about life.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.240]   You've only got a short time left, the rest, and at the end,
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   there is a terrible judgment when God will judge the whole world in righteousness
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   through his Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   And our eternal destiny will be announced and promulgated in that judgment.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   O beloved people, is this the supreme consideration in your mind and in your life?
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   Do you ever remember that you've got to give an account of the deeds done in the body to the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   This is the revelation of God.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   This is the message of this book from the very beginning to the very end,
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   that every one of us shall have to render up an account of how we've lived,
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.240]   how we've spent our time in this world,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   what we've done with the powers and the faculties that God has given us.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   And not to realize this and not to base the whole of your life upon it is sheer madness.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   You can't control the rest of your life, I mean the length of it.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   You don't know, nobody knows, but it's limited and it must end,
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.240]   because there is judgment coming and we've all got to face God.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   And that's the question.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   Have we lived to the will of God or have we lived to the will of men
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   and to the lusts of men, to the will of the Gentiles?
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   Oh, how I thank God that I've got my last word to say to you.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   There it is, life, time past, present, rest of my time,
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.240]   death, God, judgment.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   And who can stand?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   Who's lived his life to the glory of God?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:58.240]   Who's lived this Christ-like kind of life of self-abnegation and self-humiliation and self-sacrifice?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.240]   Who's done it?
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:07.240]   Who can say that he's lived his or her life in this world according to this rule?
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   and all thy mind and all thy strength, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   Who's done it? Who can stand?
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   No, no, as I look at the law I say, "If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.240]   We are all sinners, every one of us.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   We have lived to ourselves, we've been selfish,
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   we've lived this kind of life in various ways and manners.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   We are all guilty, the whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   Is there no hope? Thank God there is.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   Listen, "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,"
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   thank God for this blessed word, on January 1, 1961,
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   "Christ has come in, into this world, into this life of ours, into time, has come the Eternal,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   from the everlasting bosom, when the fullness of the times was come,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   he was made of a woman, made under the law, he's entered into it."
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   And do you know what he's done? He's changed everything.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   He's introduced a new possibility.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   Let me put it simply like this.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   Were it not for the fact of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   I would say without any fear of contradiction,
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:40.240]   without any fear that I could be mistaken in any respect at all,
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   that every one of us would spend the rest of our time in this world
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   exactly as we'd spent it before.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   I mean that.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   "Oh," you say, "but what about New Year's resolutions?"
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   Yes, I say, "Back to you, what about them?
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   Do you keep them? Can you carry them out?"
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   No, no, our wills are too weak.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   Man, by his own effort, can never change the type of his life.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   The rest of his time will be like the past of his time.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:21.240]   "Oh, but the Son of God has come,
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   and he introduces a new and a glorious possibility.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   What is it? Oh, it's this.
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   As I look back across the time past of my life
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   and see sin and shame and failure and everything that I hate,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   I can't get rid of it, but blessed be his name, he has done.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   He's taken it, and he's taken it away.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   God has banished it. It's gone. It's blotted out.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   I can't do that. No man can. Christ can, and he's done it.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   He can cleanse and clear the past.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   Christ has suffered for us in the flesh.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   Who, his own self, bear our sins in his own body on the tree?
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   Are you worried about that past of yours?
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.240]   Well, my dear friend, just believe this. He's taken it himself.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.240]   He was on the cross. He was taking your sins and bearing their punishment.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   By whose stripes we are healed.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.240]   The past has been atoned for.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.240]   It has been blotted out. It's been wiped out.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.240]   Never look at it again.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.240]   Ah, but you say, what of the future?
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:39.240]   Life is still the same, and though it's going to be January 2nd tomorrow,
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.240]   I know that life will be exactly as it was on the 31st of December.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.240]   It's no use pretending. All this nonsense of a new year.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   I know that there's nothing in it. We've done it year after year,
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.240]   but the world is still the same. The world, the flesh, the devil, and I'm still the same.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   And what's the use of saying something in Westminster Chapel on a Sunday night
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:02.240]   when I know that tomorrow I go back into the same world as exactly as I was before?
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   Oh, no, don't you make a mistake about that.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.240]   If you believe in this Christ of God, you will not be the same man.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   Peter says that these people were not the same.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   He says, you know, you're no longer Gentiles.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   You no longer need go on living that life.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   Surely you will agree that you've spent enough time at that.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   You don't want to go on with that. The time past will suffice for that sort of life.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   No, no, there's another life. What makes it possible?
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   Well, this is the offer of Christ Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:38.240]   He not only died that we might be forgiven, he died to make us good.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   He not only came into this world to bear our sins and their punishment,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   he came to give us new life.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.240]   He came to give us a new birth.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   He came that we might be born again.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.240]   He came that we might be made new men and women.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   He came to give us a new nature.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   Now, that's Christianity. It's not merely forgiveness.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.240]   It is a new beginning.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.240]   Not because it's January the first. No, no.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.240]   But because the life of God comes into you as soul.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   It's not a matter of calendars or almanacs.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.240]   It's a matter of the operation of the Spirit of God.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   These people, look how they had been living.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   The time past of your life would suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings,
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   and abominable idolatry. They'd been living like that.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   They were no longer. Why?
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   Well, they'd been born again. They'd had a new nature.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   They'd had a new life. They'd got a new outlook.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   And not only that, there was a new power in their lives.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   The Spirit of God had entered into them.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.240]   Christ had taken up his abode in them.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   They're new men.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   You see, this isn't mere theory. This isn't mere teaching.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   Let me give it to you again in these noble, eloquent words of Paul.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.240]   Be not deceived.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   And such were some of you,
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   but, blessed but,
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   such were some of you, that's how you were living,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   you couldn't help yourselves, you were besotted, you were sunken,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   such were some of you, but,
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   ye are washed,
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   but ye are sanctified,
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   but ye are justified,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.240]   in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   and by the Spirit of our God.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   If any man be in Christ Jesus,
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:59.240]   he is a new creature,
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   a new creation.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   All things are passed away.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   Behold,
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   all things
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   are become new.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   This is the only message under the sun tonight,
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   that can offer to you the possibility that the rest of your time in the flesh
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.240]   shall be entirely different from the time past of your life.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   Nothing else.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   You can't do it by your willpower and your New Year's resolutions.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   They're not worth the paper they're written on.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   They're not worth the breath that is uttered to them.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.240]   The world can't. The world can't change itself, hasn't it proved it?
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   Year after year, every one of us knows that.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   Your organizations, your education, your everything, it can't do it.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   It's failed completely.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.240]   But the gospel of Jesus Christ can do it.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   Why? Well, because it is the power of God unto salvation,
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.240]   to every one that believes in him.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:19.240]   Just as you are, having realized the truth this evening,
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   you have but to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   You have but to believe that he died for you and for your sins.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   To know that all your sins are blotted out,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   that you need never have any worry about the past any longer.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   You have but to believe that and you will receive life anew.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.240]   God will put a new nature into you.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   You won't do it, God will do it.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.240]   It's the operation of the Spirit of God,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   the mysterious operation that the Lord Jesus Christ was talking about in Nicodemus.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   Like the wind, you can't see it, you can't hear it,
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   but you don't know where it comes from or whether it goes.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.240]   He will put into you a new principle of life.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   You'll be amazed at yourself and, as we are told here,
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   everybody else will be amazed at you.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   Wherein they think it strange that he run no longer with them
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   to that same excessive riot, speaking evil of you.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   They'll say, "What's happened to him? He no longer is with us.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   He's not doing what he used to do. What's happened?"
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   They don't understand it. They think it's strange.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   Of course.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   It is the miracle of God.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   The miracle of the new birth, the new life and the new nature.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   But it is offered to you freely this evening
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   by the Son of God himself.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   The rest of your time,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   it's only very short of the best.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   And there is one who is ready and waiting to judge the quick and the dead.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   You included.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:59.240]   Oh, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   and begin to live this new life to the will of God
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   instead of the old life to the lusts of men.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   And then you'll have nothing to fear.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   In the judgment you may die in the flesh,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   but you'll live according to God in the Spirit.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.240]   And when you die it'll mean going on to be with Christ.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.240]   And what is eternity?
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.240]   The glory of being forever with the Lord.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.240]   Amen.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   So let it be.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   Let that be your desire.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   Just as you are if you've never done so before.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.240]   and thou shalt be saved
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.240]   and you'll be eternally safe.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   Amen.
