[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.340]   All right.
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.600]   Let's move on to a question from Kavindra, who says,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.320]   Cal, I have been implementing ideas from digital minimalism
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.120]   in a world without email.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.840]   And I have found that my workday has so much extra time in it.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.200]   Aside, everyone finds this when they actually
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.560]   begin being much more intentional about their time
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.640]   allocation, when they become much more intentional
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.560]   about the processes by which they collaborate,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320]   they realize that I only need this much hours
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.160]   to get my work done.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.000]   It's a little bit of a secret.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.280]   Going back to the question, I only
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160]   need less than 3/4 of my work hours
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.360]   to be completely on top of my duties.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.840]   Now that I have this time, I am realizing
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.080]   that there is much in my not work buckets that I can tackle.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.200]   However, I do not want to mix non-work things
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.680]   with being at the office for my own mental clarity.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880]   And I also don't want to look like a slacker.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.320]   Do you have examples of how people
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.520]   handle this in between time?
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.280]   So Kavindra, my standard suggestion
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.640]   here is that you should take a phantom part-time job.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.600]   So this is my terminology for the very common occurrence
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.120]   among my listeners and readers, where
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.280]   they get very intentional about their time,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.440]   realize that end processes, time and processes,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.120]   realize they have a lot of extra time in their day.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.560]   They can stay on top of their job
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.960]   with a lot of extra time, which again, is not surprising,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.760]   because most people are terrible at the mechanics of what
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.960]   they do for a living.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.560]   So when you're not terrible, you realize
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.120]   you don't need as much time.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.800]   And what I recommend is this idea of you really treat it
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.960]   like I have a part-time job, and that's
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.880]   what I do in that extra 1/4, in your case, 1/4 of my time
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.240]   that's free.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.920]   And you schedule your work for this phantom part-time job
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280]   just like you're scheduling your work for your main job.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.920]   And it happens during the workday.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.280]   And you can decide if you want to, let's say,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.600]   end your workday implicitly at 3 and then switch
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.320]   to your phantom part-time job or interleave your phantom part-time
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.640]   job during the day.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.440]   Or like a lot of people will do their phantom part-time job
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.360]   first thing in the morning, then switch over
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.640]   to their other job because there's
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   lots of meetings and stuff that happen more
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.440]   in the afternoon, the morning.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   However you want to do it, but you really
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.680]   treat it systematically like I have two jobs.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.760]   You call the second one a phantom part-time job
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.280]   because you don't make it visible
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   and you don't talk about it.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.640]   Now what do you do with your phantom part-time job?
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.640]   You have three options.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.240]   One, you use it to move to the next level
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.480]   or open up new opportunities in your existing work.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.880]   So you could be dedicating this time to, let's say,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.080]   cultivating a new rare and valuable skill that's
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.200]   going to give you a lot more options or control or autonomy
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.120]   once you do it.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.240]   Two, it could be a side hustle.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.880]   I am starting-- I want to write a novel.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.440]   I'm starting a business on the side.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.760]   I'm starting a podcast, whatever it is.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.640]   So you're working on a side hustle that
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.320]   may just be for interest or it may
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.520]   be that you want it to eventually generate enough
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280]   income that you can renegotiate your main work situation
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.920]   to be maybe part-time itself.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.800]   Or three, your phantom part-time job
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.400]   is a completely non-professional personal interest.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.840]   I want to master coffee appreciation.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   I want to master a genre of fiction or whatever,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.200]   just something high-quality leisure
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   that you really want to invest in and get better at.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.120]   The key thing here about the phantom part-time job
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.760]   is that it's focused.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   You are putting this time towards one thing
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.640]   repeatedly and carefully planning when it happens.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.280]   That is going to get you away from this weird scattered
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.600]   feeling of just I'm slacking or doing lots of hobbies and work
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.760]   and or getting lost in rabbit holes on the internet.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880]   So I love the focus of the phantom part-time job.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.520]   Choose one thing.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.920]   I am going to do this thing over the next six months
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.800]   during my work hours in the 1/4 of the work hours I have free.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   When you're that consistent and focused,
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.520]   you can do really cool things with that time.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
