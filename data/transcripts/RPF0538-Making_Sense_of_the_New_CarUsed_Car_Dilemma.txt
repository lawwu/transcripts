It's a fact of life that cars or vehicles are mechanical devices and mechanical devices over time wear down and wear out. If I offered you an unrestored car from 1950, you'd say no. You don't want it because it doesn't do what you need it to do.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:08:00.380]   We're not driving vehicles from 1950 that are not restored or from 1970. The vehicle has a life span and the earlier you buy it, the better in terms of the maximum possible life span. This is important primarily for its ability to do the job that you're buying it to do.

[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   We're going to talk about the benefits of a pickup truck.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   So if you're in a new car, you might need to buy a new car.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   So if there's a technological issue that really helps you, I alluded to pickup trucks earlier. A pickup truck that is new today has about three times the tow rating of a pickup truck that you could buy 15, 20 years ago. And so it might be worth it for you to go ahead and buy that newer, stronger vehicle because it'll do the job that you need it to do. And there may be other ancillary benefits. Example, you might need to buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:39.160]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean. Perhaps you're going to buy one for your company and you're going to wrap it with your company logos.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.240]   You can't buy a new car because it's clean. Perhaps you're going to buy one for your company and you're going to wrap it with your company logos.

[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   can't buy a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:54.840]   Well, now it doesn't make a lot of sense for you to shop around to save $5,000 by buying a used vehicle instead of a new vehicle when your aftermarket equipment is going to be about $75,000.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:09.460]   You're not getting that much of a savings for it. So you might have some of those other benefits from the new car. What are the disadvantages of buying a new car? First obvious one is do you have the money? Can you afford it? Because the new car is going to cost more upfront.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:38.920]  ,

[00:16:34.540 --> 00:17:03.440]   40. Well, let's compare new car for 40, 3 year old car for 38, 37, 36, 35. For $35,000 would you buy a 3 year old car with 40,000 miles on it instead of a brand new one at 40? I don't think I would. I would buy the $40,000 car and the reason is I can run that math in my head. If I buy a $40,000 car, I'm going to
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:32.360]  , I'm going to have a $30,000 car that doesn't have those three years. And that means that I can enjoy over the next three years, basically free use of the car. I'm not going to have repair costs. I'm not going to have, I'm going to have a longer lifespan. If the difference were only 40 versus 35, I'm still probably going to go with 40. Assuming I have the money, of course. Well, let's keep walking it down. 34 33 32.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   32 33 32.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   to go for it 30 now we could continue this game and your answer would of course be it depends depends on the actual factors depends on the market depends on the vehicle, etc, of course, it depends, but there is a number somewhere at which you would be willing to take the three year old car versus the new car. That number would be different for each person.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.400]   But on the aggregate.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.400]   But on the aggregate.

[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.400]   That number.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:16.400]   Is about 20% per year for the first year and 15% per year for the year after that.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   The general industry numbers would reflect that that $40,000 car.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:27.400]   If that car is one year old, it loses 20% of its value almost immediately.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   And so after one year, it'd be worth about $32,000.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.360]   40% of its value.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.360]   And so after one year, it'd be worth about $32,000.

[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:28.200]  berger.com/triple-of-the-world. That's important to know. Now different vehicles with different attributes will have other terminal values. If you were having a big flatbed truck or a dump truck, the terminal value of a 30-year-old dump truck would be a whole lot more than $1,000. Why? Because somebody could buy it and as long as it works, they could buy it and they could run a business with it. And they could move loads of dirt from place A to place B, charge people for that, so it's going to be worth more than $1,000.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:57.140]   My little old Toyota Corolla that I owned for years didn't do anything except move people. I couldn't load dirt. But that's that terminal value. So the appreciation goes down, down, down towards that terminal value. But as you own the car, what's happening with the repair costs? Remember, those are going up. And those repair costs could range from minimal to significant. So if that 40,000 dollars is going to be used for a repair, then it's going to be a lot more than $1,000.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.140]   So if that 40,000 dollars is going to be used for a repair, then it's going to be a lot more than $1,000.

[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:48.040]   So let's get out of the weeds on depreciation, but you need to understand that.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.800]   You can't escape the cost.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.740]   You're just going to either pay the cost in terms of depreciation,
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.880]   or
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:54.960]   you're just going to either pay the cost in terms of depreciation,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   or

[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   or
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:12.960]   If you analyze all these factors, I think what you'll find is an ability to discern what would be appropriate for you in your situation.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:24.020]   For personal automobiles, frequently, you don't need those new car attributes.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.020]   For personal automobiles, frequently, you don't need those new car attributes.

[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   For personal automobiles, you simply usually need something that's going to work most of the time.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   So, we don't use them all that much. Most of the driving of a personal automobile is not extreme duty. It's just light duty.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   It's just light duty. It's just light duty.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   It's just light duty. It's just light duty.

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:25.020]  , and we usually don't keep our cars for very long.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.020]   Most people don't seem to think that far down the road as far as their vehicle purchase, and they either have a change in their circumstances, which lead to them wanting a different type of vehicle, or they get bored with the vehicle and want to move up to something different. So, personal automobiles aren't usually used to maximum capacity. And in personal automobiles, things like downtime become much less efficient.
