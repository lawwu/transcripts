[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Today, we tackle the subject of new cars.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   A question came in on the Twitter a few weeks ago
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   about leasing a car, and I sat down a couple of times
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and recorded a show on car leasing,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   but there always ended up being two distinct parts of it.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   See, the major problem with leasing a car
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   is not the lease itself.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The major problem is that you have to lease a new car.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So I realized that first we need to talk about new cars
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   as compared to older, used cars,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and then separately, we can talk about leasing
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   versus some other form of new car financing.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So today, we talk about buying a new car.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Now, new cars are one of those things that get a bad rap
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   in the personal finance space for good reason,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   because frankly, they can be very expensive
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and very deleterious to your personal wealth.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   However, I want to explain to you why.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   See, I don't approach most topics in finance
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   with a dogmatic approach.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   It's not that I mind dogma.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I just want dogma to be applied in the place
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   where dogma is important,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and not to be mixed up in places where dogma is not.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And I want to explain to you why new cars,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   for most of us, are usually not the best idea.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   But you can listen to these reasons,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and then judge for yourself.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So if you were going to buy a car,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   what would be some of the benefits that you could get
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   from choosing to buy a brand spankin' new car?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, of course it would smell great.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It would be very clean and very beautiful.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You could peel a lot of little plastic
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   off of the things yourself.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   You could make sure that nobody else's muddy boots
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   had soiled your carpet.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Those things are simple and obvious.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But what are some of those other benefits
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   that don't wear off in a few weeks
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   after the new car smell has effectively disappeared?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   In my mind, one of the biggest benefits
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   of your choosing to buy a new car
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   is you can get exactly what you want.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   As someone who's purchased a variety of used vehicles,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I have learned that you can usually get
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   most of what you want,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   but it's very rare for you to get exactly what you want.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   When you home in on the particular type of vehicle
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   that you want, the particular make and model,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   you then start thinking about what attributes,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   what combination of features would be most helpful
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   or most appropriate to your intended use case,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and then you have to order those.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I recently bought a pickup truck,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   and my ideal pickup truck, it had to have a crew cab,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   but I wanted to have a long bed,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   a crew cab and a long bed.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But I was also committed, more than having the long bed,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I was committed to having a diesel engine in it,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   a particular diesel engine in that particular vehicle.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And so that was essential,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   was the diesel engine and the crew cab.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The long bed I put on the list of,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   "Well, it'd be nice to have if I can,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   but I'm not going to make that the only thing I get."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Similar thing with four-wheel drive versus two-wheel drive.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I didn't mind either way,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   but I probably would have been happier
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   to have a four-wheel drive,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   but I was happy to have a two-wheel drive.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I didn't have to make a solid decision.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Well, I wound up with the diesel engine,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   which was a must-have,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and the crew cab, which was a must-have,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   but I wound up with a short bed,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   two-wheel drive pickup truck.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now that fit my needs,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   but it wasn't exactly what I wanted.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But I couldn't hold out for exactly what I wanted
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   because I needed to buy the car,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   and I was shopping in the used car marketplace.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And you can't force somebody else
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   to sell their vehicle just when you want,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and you can't force them to sell it
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   at the price that you want.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   If I were going to go into a new car dealership
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and buy a new pickup truck,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   then it would be very easy for me to sit down
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and have a chat and say,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   "Listen, I want a four-wheel drive
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   crew cab pickup truck with a long bed,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and I want this engine configuration,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   and oh, by the way,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   let's go ahead and put the towing package on it.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Let me choose the paint.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Let me choose the interior color."
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And you can spec out everything
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   to be exactly what you want.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   So here's the question.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   How important to you
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   is the ability to spec out exactly what you want?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Here you'll need to think about your use case.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Do you intend to use this vehicle
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   just for transporting your body
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   from place A to place B,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   or your body and one or two
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   or a handful of other people
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   from place A to place B?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   In that context,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   just about anything will do the job.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You need to have exactly the right thing
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   in order for you to have your body moved.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But if you were doing something like I was doing,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   buying a pickup truck,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and let's say that you would spec out
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   a very heavy camper,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   in your case,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   it might be very important to you
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   to have the sufficient
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   gross vehicle weight rating on your vehicle,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and you need to spec it out
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   exactly how you want it to be.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Or perhaps you're going to load on
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   some kind of aftermarket equipment.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   In this case,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   it's very important that your vehicle
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   be manufactured according to your specifications
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   so it can do the job.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And you have to decide,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   how important is it to me
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   to get exactly what I want?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   If it's very important
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   to get exactly what you want,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   you will probably move in the direction
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   of a new car versus a used car.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   What are the benefits, are there,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   of a new car versus a used car?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Well, another obvious
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and very important benefit
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   is a new car will have
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   the maximum possible lifespan.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   When a vehicle is manufactured
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and put on the road,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   in that very first drive,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   the clock starts running.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Its lifespan starts ticking down.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   There is, for any vehicle,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   a maximum potential lifespan.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And the earlier the vehicle is
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   in that lifespan,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   the more time you can drive it,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   the more time you'll have
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   with that vehicle.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's a fact of life
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   that cars or vehicles
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   are mechanical devices,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and mechanical devices,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   over time, wear down and wear out.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   If I offered you an unrestored car
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   from 1950, you'd say no.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You don't want it,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   because it doesn't do
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   what you need to do.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We're not driving vehicles
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   from 1950 that are not restored,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   or from 1970.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   The vehicle has a lifespan,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and the earlier you buy it,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   the better in terms of
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   the maximum possible lifespan.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   This is important primarily
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   for its ability to do the job
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   that you're buying it to do.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   You want it to do the job
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   that you're buying it to do.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   If you need a car
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   to pull your camper,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   well, it needs to be able to do that.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   If you need a car
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   to get you down the road,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   it needs to be able to do that.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So it needs to be able to do the job,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and you want it to do the job
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   for the most amount of time.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And you want it to do the job
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   for the most amount of time
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   with the lowest repair costs.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   So imagine for a moment a chart,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and on the horizontal axis,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   the x-axis, you have time
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   going from left to right,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   and your mind goes from
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   zero units of time
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   up to the maximum units of time.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And on the up and down
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   vertical axis, the y-axis,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   you have cost.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   A new car at the beginning
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   will have very low repair costs.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   In fact, for a brand new car,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   that may just be factored
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   into the deal that you worked out
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   with the dealership.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You may not have to pay
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   for any repairs
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   while the car is under warranty.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So that line of costs
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   starts at the bottom left,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and it goes up to the top right
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   in an increasing line.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now, it's not an exact 45-degree line.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's probably more of a geometric curve
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   where it's very slow
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   and low in the beginning,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   and then it starts to increase
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   significantly at some point.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   But there's another cost,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   which is depreciation.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And that line starts off on the left
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   at very high,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and it comes down to very low.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That one is also not
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   a direct 45-degree declining line.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Rather, it actually comes down
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   massively in the beginning,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and then it starts to smooth out
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   over time.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   These two lines
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   are your costs.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And early in the car lifespan,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   there should be very low
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   maintenance costs.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Late in the car lifespan,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   high maintenance costs.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Early in the car lifespan,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   there's high depreciation costs.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Later, there's low depreciation costs.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So you're paying either way.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   You're either paying with
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   repair costs,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   or you're paying in depreciation costs.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The point is, the new car gets you
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   the maximum possible lifespan,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   which if you're choosing a car
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   that you can or intend to drive
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   for a long period of time,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   that can be very important to you
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   because it can be a real hassle
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   for you to go and to get a new car
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   all the time.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   In addition, one of the benefits
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   of buying a new car
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   is the useful lifespan
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   may possibly be expanded or extended
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   because of your good care
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and good maintenance practices
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   practiced on the car
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   from the very beginning.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   For example, you may be able to make sure
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   that that vehicle has always had
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   high-quality synthetic fluids.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, in the short term,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   high-quality synthetic fluids
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   versus conventional fluids
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   may not make a big difference
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   to your vehicle lifespan.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But when you can stretch that out
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   over decades,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   those fluids might make
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   a very big difference
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   or your simple ability to ensure
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that the maintenance on the vehicle
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   is performed on the appropriate schedule.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Cars don't just break.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   If they're maintained,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   there's really very little reason
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   why a car should ever break down
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   if it's maintained
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and if it's proactively maintained.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So if you bought one
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   from the very beginning
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   and you made sure
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   that the maintenance schedule was done
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   and you knew what the lifespan is
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   of the various bits of equipment,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   you know that we changed the oil
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   on this schedule,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   we changed the tires on this schedule,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   we changed the belts on this schedule,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   there's no reason why
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   you couldn't have a vehicle
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   with proactive maintenance
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   that never left you stranded
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   over the course of 20 or 30 years.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And it's a whole lot easier
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   to do that if you've owned the car
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   from the beginning.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So by buying new,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   you could get the maximum
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   potential lifespan
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   and the maximum potential reliability
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   by knowing the maintenance history.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Now there could be
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   some other benefits of a car.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   For example,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   a new car might give you access
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   to the latest technology.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Consumer Reports recently
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   has gone to the position
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   where they find that
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   the new crash avoidance systems
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   are mandatory.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They love all of the new
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   crash avoidance systems,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   the emergency braking systems
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   that are available on new cars.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You might look at something like that
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and say, "That's really important,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and I can't get that on an old car.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's hard to retrofit.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So I'll just go ahead and get a new car
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   so I can do that
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   because of the safety upgrade."
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Or perhaps you appreciate
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   getting a newer car
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   that has an excellent crash rating
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and is very, very safe
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   for the occupants
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   in case of a crash.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Well, you may not be able
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   to get that on an older car,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and so you may need to buy a new car.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So if there's a technological issue
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   that really helps you,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I alluded to pickup trucks earlier.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   A pickup truck that is new today
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   has about three times the tow rating
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   of a pickup truck
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   that you could buy 15, 20 years ago.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And so it might be worth it
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   for you to go ahead
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   and buy that newer, stronger vehicle
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   because it'll do the job
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that you need it to do.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And there may be other
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   ancillary benefits.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Example, you might need to buy
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   a new car because it's clean.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Perhaps you're going to buy one
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   for your company,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and you're going to wrap it
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   with your company logos.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   A lot easier to do that
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   with a new car with straight sheet metal
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and clean paint
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   than an older one
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   with a bunch of dents in it, perhaps.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Or if you're going to be adding
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   specialty aftermarket equipment
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   to the vehicle.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Well, now it doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   for you to shop around
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   to save $5,000
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   by buying a used vehicle
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   instead of a new vehicle
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   when your aftermarket equipment
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   is going to be about $75,000.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You're not getting that much
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   of a savings for it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   So you might have
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   some of those other benefits
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   from the new car.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Well, what are the disadvantages
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   of buying a new car?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   First obvious one is,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   do you have the money?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Can you afford it?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Because the new car
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   is going to cost more up front.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And here I would encourage you
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   to think about the available cash
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   that you have.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Now, poor people often wind up
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   in a difficult situation.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   They frequently will be driving
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   an older car that's requiring
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   more repair costs,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and this older car that's requiring
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   more repair costs
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   is taking money out of their pocket.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   But then, in order to solve that,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   they often go and sign up
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   for a new car payment,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   which does have the benefit
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   of taking those older repairs
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   out of the way, mostly.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But now those older occasional repairs
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   are replaced with a consistent,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   regular car payment.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So I would just say,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   do you have the money?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I've never borrowed money on a car.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I don't intend to ever
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   borrow money on the car.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I don't see any value
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   of borrowing money for a car.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Just simply pay for your stuff.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And if you do that,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   it keeps your life in a simple
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and peaceful place
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   that is really healthy.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   It's good for your mind.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   It's good for your wallet.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And it's good just for
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   the peace of your life.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And you don't wind up wondering
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   if you're going to wander
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   out of work one day
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   and see the repo man
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   driving off with your vehicle.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   So do you have the money?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   If you don't have the money,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   don't buy it.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   But the big cost, of course,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   is depreciation.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Now, what is depreciation?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Depreciation is the decrease
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   in value that an asset has
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   simply by virtue of it being older.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Think about this.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   If you were going to buy
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   a new car for $40,000
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and you had the choice
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   between buying a brand new car
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   for $40,000
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   or a three-year-old car
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   that somebody has put
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   tons of miles on for $40,000,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   which would you choose?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   The obviousness of that answer
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   is what drives the car marketplace.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You would be a fool to pay $40,000
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   for the three-year-old car
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   when you could go buy the new one
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   for $40,000 and enjoy
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   all those other benefits
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   of the new car.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Now, as we start walking down
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   those numbers,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   we're going to at some point
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   come to a change.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Let's pretend new car is $40,000
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and now that three-year-old car
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   is available for $39,000.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Now, which would you choose?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Most people are still going
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   to go to the 40.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Well, let's compare new car for 40,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   three-year-old car for 38,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   37,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   36,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   35.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   For $35,000,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   would you buy a three-year-old car
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   with 40,000 miles on it
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   instead of a brand new one at 40?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I don't think I would.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I would buy the $40,000 car.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And the reason is
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I can run that math in my head.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   If I buy a $40,000 car
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   that doesn't have those three years,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and that means that I can enjoy
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   over the next three years
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   basically free use of the car.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I'm not going to have repair costs.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'm not going to have
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   a longer lifespan.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   If the difference were only
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   40 versus 35,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I'm still probably going to go with 40,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   assuming I have the money, of course.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Let's keep walking it down.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   34,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   33,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   32,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   31.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   How about 30?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Which would you go for at 30?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Now, we could continue this game,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   and your answer would, of course, be
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   it depends.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   It depends on the actual factors.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   It depends on the market.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   It depends on the vehicle, etc.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Of course it depends.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   But there is a number somewhere
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   at which you would be willing
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   to take the three-year-old car
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   versus the new car.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   That number would be different
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   for each person.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But on the aggregate,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   that number
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   is about 20%
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   per year for the first year,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and 15% per year
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   for the year after that.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   The general industry numbers
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   would reflect that that $40,000 car,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   if that car is one year old,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   it loses 20% of its value
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   almost immediately.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And so after one year,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   it would be worth about $32,000.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   40% minus 20% equals $32,000.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And then each year ongoing,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   it loses about 15% of its value.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Or at least that's what most people
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   on the aggregate across the whole marketplace
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   feel that vehicles are worth.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So at the end of 12 months,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   the $40,000 car is worth $32,000.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   At the end of 24 months,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   the $32,000 car is worth $27,200.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   At the end of 36 months,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   that car is worth $23,000.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   At the end of 48 months,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   it's $19,000.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   At the end of 60 months,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   it's $16,700, and on and on.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   If we continue that number each year,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   notice that the value continues to go down,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   but because it's based upon percentages,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   it goes down a little bit less
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   in dollar amounts each year.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   60 months, it's $16,700.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   End of 72 months, it's $14,199.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   End of 84 months, it's $12,069.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   End of 96 months, $10,258.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   End of 108, 108 months, $8,720.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And at the end of 120 months, $7,412.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So if you bought a brand new $40,000 car,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   you could expect at the end of 10 years
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   or 120 months,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   it's value to be about $7,400.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Now think for yourself
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   about the current car marketplace
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and see if that matches up
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   with your own experience.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I'm recording and publishing this show
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   in April of 2018.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   So think of a 2008 vehicle
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that new cost about $40,000.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Think what you'll find
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   if you were to do research on it
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   or to think about it,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   you'll find that most vehicles of that vintage,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   if it cost about $40,000 new,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   would probably be worth about $7,000 to $8,000
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   in today's dollars, today's market.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So this is depreciation.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Over the course of that 10 years,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   the original owner of the vehicle
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   has lost $33,000.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   $32,000, $33,000.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Now what have they gained
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   for that $32,000 or $33,000?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   The use of the car.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   They've been able to use the car
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and get the benefit of the transportation
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   for them and their goods
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   for those 10 years.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   That's the trade-off they're making.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   So the value of the vehicle is being used up.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Now at some point in time,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   the age of the vehicle starts to become
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   less and less relevant.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And it has more to do,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   the value of the car has more to do
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   with the usefulness of the vehicle.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   There is a terminal value of a vehicle.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   That ultimate terminal value
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   is the scrap metal price.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Depending on scrap metal prices,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   it's probably around $500 to $1,000.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I've taken cars and scrapped them.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   At the time, metal prices were higher,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   but one time I scrapped a car
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and it was about $600 that they gave me for it.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   That was what the recycler could take,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   crush the car, and sell the car,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   the value for in the recycled metal marketplace.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That number will vary,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   but you should always have a guess of that number.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I'm going to tell you right now,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   if you have $500 in your head,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   that's pretty much a good value.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   The next bit of terminal value
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   is just simply does it work?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Does it move you from point A to point B?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And so here would be,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   that terminal value is probably about $1,000.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   In my market here in South Florida,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   any vehicle that works
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   is going to be worth $1,000.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Now, if it works and it has air conditioning,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   it might be worth double,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   but if it works, it's worth $1,000.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   And I've bought a couple of cars here and there
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   for terminal value, for in that number.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Years ago, I bought a 1998 Toyota Corolla.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I bought it for $500,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   and it was one of these situations.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   The car was old, but it worked.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It was in not great condition, but it worked.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And so it was at its terminal value.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I drove the car for a number of years,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   have kept it around,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   it's been used by other people,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and then I sold it for $1,000.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So it did its job.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   It worked.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And that car will really,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   as long as it's running,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   really need never be worth less
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   than that $500 to $1,000 range.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   That's important to know.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Now, different vehicles with different attributes
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   will have other terminal values.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   If you were having a big flatbed truck or a dump truck,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   the terminal value of a 30-year-old dump truck
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   would be a whole lot more than $1,000.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Why?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Because somebody could buy it,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and as long as it works,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   they could buy it and they could run a business with it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And they could move loads of dirt
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   from place A to place B,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   charge people for that.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   So it's going to be worth more than $1,000.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   My little old Toyota Corolla that I owned for years
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   didn't do anything except move people.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I couldn't load dirt.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   But that's that terminal value.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So the depreciation goes down, down, down
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   towards that terminal value.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   But as you own the car,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   what's happening with the repair costs?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Remember, those are going up.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And those repair costs
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   could range from minimal to significant.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So if that $40,000 car owner
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   paid $33,000 to own it for 10 years and use it,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   the question is,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   how much money does the next owner,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   who buys it when it's 10 years old for $7,500,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   how much money are they going to pay
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   over the next 10 years in repair costs?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   This is the great unknown.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   With some vehicles, that cost can be very high.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   With some vehicles, it could be not so much.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And this would have to do with the make and the model,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   the usage by the owner,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and how well the maintenance was done on that vehicle.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And here's where in used car pricing,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   you should be very, very sensitive
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   to the mechanical state of the car
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and not so sensitive to the price.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   It may be well worth your interest
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   to buy that 10-year-old vehicle for $10,000
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   if it was owned by a single owner
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   who was meticulous in their maintenance
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   and was using the car every single day
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   over those 10 years
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   and can show you all of the maintenance records
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   for the last 10 years
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and you can see that proactive maintenance was done,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   fluids were changed regularly, et cetera.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I'd quickly be willing to pay $10,000
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   for that $7,500 car
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   if that owner had all of that proof and data for me
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   where if I were to stumble across that $7,500 car
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and see that it had been beat up,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I could discern that the maintenance hadn't been done,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I might not even pay $5,000 for it
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   because it would be no deal at $5,000.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   So let's get out of the weeds on depreciation,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   but you need to understand that.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   You can't escape the cost.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You're just going to either pay the cost
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   in terms of depreciation or repairs.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So which cost will be less for your context?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   That's the question.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   If you analyze all these factors,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I think what you'll find
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   is an ability to discern
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   what would be appropriate for you in your situation.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   For personal automobiles,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   frequently you don't need those new car attributes.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   For personal automobiles,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   you simply usually need something that's going to work
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   most of the time.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Most personal automobiles aren't really driven all that much.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   They might do 8,000 to 12,000 miles a year,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but in terms of the capacity of the vehicle,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   that's not really that much.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   The car could do 10,000 miles a month
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   and it would work fine.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   So we don't use them all that much.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Most of the driving of a personal automobile
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   is not extreme duty.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It's just light driving.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And we usually don't keep our cars for very long.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Most people don't seem to think that far down the road
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   as far as their vehicle purchase,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   they either have a change in their circumstances,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   which leads to them wanting a different type of vehicle,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   or they get bored with the vehicle
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and want to move up to something different.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   So personal automobiles aren't usually used
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   to maximum capacity.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And in personal automobiles,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   things like downtime become much less important.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   If your car breaks down and it's in the shop for a week,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   that of course could be an inconvenience.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But it's not really costing you all that much money or time.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   If you were to compare this to a business
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   that's actively making money on their vehicles,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   that difference would be significant.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   In the Southeast, there is a large grocery chain
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   called Publix, and Publix uses these nice green trucks.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   My understanding, just from reading the door stickers,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   is that Publix leases all of their trucks.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Why do they lease their trucks?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   They have worked out some kind of deal, I'm sure.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   But if you think about a grocery store like a Publix,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   or in your area maybe it's a Kroger or a Walmart
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   or anything like that,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   what you'll see is their trucks have to be reliable
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   because the grocery store is running
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   on a just-in-time inventory management system.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And there's a central warehouse or a regional warehouse.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   That warehouse has most of the supplies.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   And then each day, perhaps multiple times per day,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   a semi-truck is getting loaded up from that warehouse
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   and is moving things to the store to be sold.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And there's a computer system that's maintaining
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   very little inventory in the back of the store
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and is consistently and quickly moving things
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   from the distribution center into the store.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Well, in that context, if a truck breaks down
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   on the side of the road,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   there may be a bunch of products that run out on the store.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And that could result in customer dissatisfaction.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Customers annoyed and say, "That's it.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   They don't even have this. I'm going to go shop somewhere else."
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And it could result in lost sales.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Customer comes in, wants to buy something.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   It's not there. They have to go to another store.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   That's money that's not into Publix's pocket.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   That's money that goes into Walmart's pocket, etc.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And so for a company like Publix,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   they need their trucks to be very reliable.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And I don't think I've ever seen a Publix truck
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   broken down on the side of the road.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I'm sure it happens, but I don't think I've ever seen it.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And so for them, the cost of depreciation of a vehicle
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   will be not so bad--
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   sorry, not such a cost as the cost of downtime on a truck.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   This could be applied in your business as well.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Perhaps you are a roofer,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and you're running a crew of roofing guys.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And those roofing guys are using your dump truck,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   loading up the roofing materials.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And if you think about the labor costs of, say,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   a crew of eight guys that are going to go
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and rip a roof off a house,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and the cost of making sure that your jobs are lined up,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and the revenue that can come in if you can run a tight schedule
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and move your eight guys from house to house right on time,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   that cost, your consistent cost to your business,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   is very significant.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And if your dump truck is down with mechanical problems,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   that can result in an entire week of lost productivity.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You've got eight guys not able to work,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and you're going to be paying them for some of their time.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   You're missing jobs. You're bouncing customers around.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   That could be a serious problem for your business.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   If you compare the cost of depreciation,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   you might find that the cost of depreciation
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   is relatively low compared to the scale of your daily wages
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   that you're paying for all your guys.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   So you'll see a business need that uptime with their vehicles
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   far more than they need to save every last dollar.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   But that's not the case with most of our personal automobiles.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   If your car's in the shop,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and you've got to get a ride to work a couple days,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   it's not going to make you lose $30,000
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   because you didn't get this re-roofing job done on time.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So with personal automobiles,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   we simply don't usually use them to maximum capacity.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And so there's probably a sweet spot there
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   where you can buy a vehicle that has depreciated a little bit,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   but that still has lots of maximum useful life left.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Usually, depending on the person, depending on the car,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   this is why most personal finance advisors
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   will recommend buying a car that's a few years old.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Anywhere, two, three, four years old.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You can get a good deal on a car
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   that still has a huge amount of useful life left.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And those cost savings can be substantial.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Now, numbers, remember a $40,000 baseline car,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   at the end of 36 months,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   that $40,000 baseline car could be worth $23,000.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   You can buy that car for $23,000,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and that 36-month-old car could very well last you for a decade
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   with very low repair costs
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   because you're using it pretty lightly
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   as compared to the maximum useful lifespan of the vehicle.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   If you buy new cars, if you choose to do that,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   the best thing for you to do is to keep those
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   for a long period of time.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   If you'll keep a car for a long period of time,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   your total out-of-pocket outlay will be substantially less.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Let me use an example case here.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Pretend that you buy, every three years,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   you buy a new car,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and each year you buy a $40,000 car.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So you're always buying a new $40,000 car.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Now, how you're buying it doesn't matter,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   whether you're leasing it or buying it,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   just you're always getting a new $40,000 car.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And then you're selling that $40,000 car after three years.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Well, a $40,000 car, 36 months later,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   you can expect it to be worth $23,120 of value when you sell it.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   So that equals a depreciation of $16,880 in those first three years.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   What that means is if you were to buy and sell a car
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   every three years for 30 years,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   your total loss of value for depreciation would be $168,800.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Let's say that you stretch that out from three years to five years.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Well, now, if you keep your car for five years instead of three years,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   your $40,000 car would be traded in at the end of five years for $16,704.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   So your depreciation loss every five years is $23,296.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Take that out over the course of 30 years,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   and you wind up with $139,775 of depreciation cost.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And final example, let's say that you only buy a new car every 10 years.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   $40,000, but you buy the new car every 10 years.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   That means that you buy it for $40,000 and you sell it for $7,412.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Well, now your depreciation cost is $32,588.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And here your total loss of value over 30 years is a total of $97,000.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And so what you see is keeping your car for three years
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   costs you $168,800 over 30 years.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Keeping it for five years costs you about $140,000.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And keeping it for 10 years costs you only about $98,000.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   That's a big savings, about $74,000 of savings
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   by keeping your cars for 10 years versus three years.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Now you, of course, will have to take that
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and figure out your maintenance costs
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   because you would have more maintenance and repair costs
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   keeping your cars for 10 years versus three years.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   But would you have $74,000 more total over that 30 years?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   It's hard for me to imagine it.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Which brings me to my final point.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   The reason that this works in the United States
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   is not because it's always better to buy used cars versus new cars.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   The reason that the used car marketplace is so strong in the United States
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   is because so many people constantly buy new cars and trade them in.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   The good market for used cars that you can get for a deal
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   exists because so many people buy new cars.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Think about it.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   If everybody bought a new car and kept it for 10, 15, or 20 years,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   would you always want to buy a 10 or 15 or 20-year-old car?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I think more and more people would be pointed towards the new ones.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And this exists in some other countries.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I've traveled in places, and you start looking at used car prices,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   and you say, "Man, this doesn't make any sense."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It only makes sense just to go ahead and buy the new car
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   and get all of those other benefits, getting exactly what you want,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   maximum possible lifespan, maximum potential reliability,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   latest technology, make it exactly how you want for the total amount of time.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   That makes more sense than buying the used car
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   because there's not an abundant supply.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Same thing happens with the size of the middle class.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   If the middle class--or if there's a big middle class
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   and there are lots of people that are going out and buying new cars,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   keeping them for a few years, trading them in,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   that creates a large number of good quality used cars that you can buy.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   But if you go to a country where there is no middle class,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   where you have a very small, wealthy elite,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   and you have a massive, poor lower class,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   then that strong marketplace of used cars doesn't exist,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and so you don't have that to draw on.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   So in thinking about this, you'll have to analyze your situation.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And my advice, just like just about everyone else,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   is unless you have some major need for that new car,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   or you have the money and you want it,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   and you've decided this is something that's important to me,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   for your simple personal transportation,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   it usually makes more sense just to go ahead and buy a used car.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   You save a lot of money up front, and you get plenty of lifespan.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   There's a big market supply that you can probably get
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   just about exactly what you want.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The vehicle has loads of reliability left in its lifespan.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   You can get great technology, et cetera.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So there's no reason to pay that brand new price.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   But don't get too mad at the people that you see driving new cars.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Always remember that it's their actions that's creating the market
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   that you're taking advantage of.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   By all means, help them to save their money.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   But if they don't want to listen to you, I wouldn't yell too loudly.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I would just offer to buy their car from them when they're done.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Thank you for listening.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   You've honored me with your time and attention,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   with some ideas and strategies and tactics and techniques and tools
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   make a plan to take action on it.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   Listening does lead to learning,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead to a life change.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   So take action.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   and share it with somebody that you care about.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   That helps the person that you are engaging with,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   and it also helps you because teaching others
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   is one of the most effective ways for you to learn
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   and for you to cement your learning.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Three, if there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and if you're gaining financial benefit from Radical Personal Finance,
