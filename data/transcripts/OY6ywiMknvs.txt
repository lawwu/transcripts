[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So to cultivate a deep life, one of the things you have to do is take in a lot of high quality
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.960]   information. Information relevant to your current work. Information relevant to ideas or projects
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.920]   you might one day soon do with your work. Information relevant to just making your life
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.920]   in general more meaningful and satisfying. The problem of course is there's also a lot of noise
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.880]   surrounding this signal. We live in a distracted world. We're bombarded by information. So we need
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.720]   some way to efficiently keep track of the information that matters. That's what I want
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.360]   to talk to you about today. The system I use for keeping notes on information for all parts of my
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.240]   work and life. Now here's the thing. There's a lot of these types of systems discussed online.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.480]   Typically there's complicated software coupled with even more complicated note-taking philosophies
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.600]   for how to use that software. As you will soon see, my system is the opposite. It is minimalist.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   It is as low friction as I can make it while still having it functionally capture notes in a way that
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.800]   I can one day use. So I'm going to start by explaining why when it comes to note-taking
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.480]   I lean towards extreme simplicity and then I'll walk you through the three different
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   types of ways I take notes in my actual life and work. All right, so why don't I use complicated
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   systems and software? Well, this comes down to friction. Friction is an important concept.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.880]   When we're talking about work, friction describes the extra effort or time or complexity that
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.080]   surrounds the actual task you're trying to accomplish. Right? So that's what we mean by
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.880]   friction here. In some cases when it comes to work, friction doesn't matter. So I have an example.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.720]   This is actually one I go into in detail in my upcoming book, Slow Productivity. It's an example
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.440]   about how the New Yorker writer John McPhee works on his articles, his famous long-form articles.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:15.200]   TLDR, there's a lot of friction in his approach. It is a very slow, over-complicated approach to
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   preparing his articles. I won't give the full procedure here, but it involves, among other
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.440]   things, typing up every single note from every interview that he did, organizing them, cutting
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.720]   them out with scissors, having these slivers of paper that he moves around in the different piles,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.880]   grouping these piles into themes, putting the themes in the folders. And then when it comes
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.280]   time to write a particular section of his book, taking out a piece of plywood, and he starts
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.800]   arranging slivers on the plywood in the order that he might want to actually use them so that when he
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.920]   finally writes, all that information is written. So that's a ton of overhead. It's a ton of friction.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:03.440]   In this case, it doesn't matter. The primary thing John McPhee is trying to do is think deeply and
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.120]   write really well. So friction in this context slows him down in a way that's actually beneficial.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.960]   It allows him to organize his thoughts. It allows him to better recognize what's working and what's
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.280]   not working. He doesn't want to speed up here. To give John McPhee an app on his phone that allows
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.000]   him to just tap his Air Bud and immediately start talking, and it will transcribe automatically into
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.920]   a New Yorker article that a Zapier script will then take and send off to a script that will then
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.680]   run it through chat GPT to look for errors and then automatically send it to his editor. He
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.840]   doesn't need that. He needs to take a long time. Friction is fine. In other cases, however,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.800]   friction can be a real problem. Note-taking, I think, is one of those cases. When information
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.600]   is coming at you, your time to act, your energy to think, both are probably pretty limited.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.280]   So if I have a relatively complicated system I have to boot up and start using markup code to
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.800]   take this article I just randomly came across and enter it into my system and cross-reference it
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.920]   with the right Zettelkasten categorization system so it will semantically link to other related
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.960]   articles, I'm probably just going to say, "Forget about it." That friction stops me from taking
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.440]   action. Or if I have friction over something I need to do, like reading a book, I have an
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.080]   elaborate way of how I'm going to copy every note from this book into my system. I might not just
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   read that book because I only have so much energy for reading and I might be taxing every last bit
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.280]   of energy I have just to tackle this book. You make that 20% harder, I might not just read the
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.680]   book. Or I'll read it and say, "Forget it. I'm not taking notes on everything." And that
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.360]   information then is lost. So when it comes to actually capturing information from all the
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.760]   stuff that's out there, unlike, say, writing a long New Yorker piece, friction is a problem.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.640]   So you want your note-taking systems to lower that friction so that you can actually
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.960]   capture effectively as much of the important information as is possible.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.320]   Another problem with elaborate systems is that they often aim to take everything out of your
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.440]   brain. It should be in this external system. The system will organize the information. You don't
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.400]   have to remember anything. When you want to know about something, the system, you can dive down in
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.440]   the system and it will unearth for you everything you've encountered that's relevant to it.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.280]   I actually think when it comes to the big things in your life, be it big work projects or be it
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.200]   things about just the way you live, keeping some of this in your brain is not a bad thing.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   Because what your brain is doing with this information is updating its internal schemas
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.320]   that it used to make sense of the world. And if information is useful, if it's in your brain,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.160]   it's going to get integrated into these systems. And then when you apply these systems to try to
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.400]   make decisions, you'll remember this information or at least some of it. Okay, this is relevant
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.960]   to me. This idea sticks. In other words, when it comes to big ideas and important information,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.600]   you want your brain to be part of the curation filtering system. You remember, yeah, this book,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   it stuck with me. It had these examples I remember were really important for X.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.320]   Now you might have to still go to your notes to see what those examples are.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   But the fact that your brain remembered that book was important.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.320]   That I think is crucial. We don't want to outsource everything out of our brain.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.840]   We want it to be involved in filtering and prioritizing, curating, and trying to make
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.320]   sense of information in the background. Simple systems allow that because they're not trying to
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.080]   capture everything relevant to the information you come across.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   All right, so let's actually talk about my systems. I'm going to break this up into three sections.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.000]   The first, let's deal with books. I read a lot of books. Hopefully you read a fair amount of books
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.880]   as well. There is information in books as relevant to your work. There's information in books as
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.360]   relevant to your life. The last episode, we had a big long thing about how to actually encounter
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.040]   self-help information of various levels of quality. That's important. So how do you take notes on
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.600]   books? Well, I'm going to show you my method. I'm going to draw here just so you'll bring up for
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:27.840]   those who are watching. If you're listening, go to the deeplife.com/listen episode 287. The video
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.320]   will be at the bottom. I'm going to draw a picture of a book page here, Jesse, so I can show you.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.040]   We'll pretend like this is a real book page. And then I'll take some sample notes on it. So I'm
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.920]   putting some like words on here. The method I use for taking notes on books, I call it the corner
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.800]   marking method. And it is as low friction as you can possibly make note taking on books while still
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.040]   actually being useful. Here's what I do. If there's something on this page, like the page you see here
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.360]   that is interesting to me, or I want to remember, first thing I do is I mark the corner like this.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.120]   So just mark a line across the corner. Now I know if I'm flipping through this book that that page
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.720]   has something important on it. What do I then do with the information on this page
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:22.400]   that is actually I want to remember? Simple marks in the margins. Right? So I might, for example,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.480]   put a little box. See here. I might put a little bit of a box around text that's important. Or I
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.040]   might just put a little bit of a checkmark next to a line. Or I might put a curly brace next to
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.800]   a paragraph that I want to remember. Just small marks in the margins to indicate what lines are
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.840]   important. Occasionally, I might scribble a little note to myself as well. If there's like a particular
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.520]   thing that reminds me of. That's it. This barely slows you down as you're going through a book.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.280]   Mark, mark, mark. I usually keep, you'll see me, I'll have a pencil in my teeth as I'm reading.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.440]   I'll pull it out. Mark, mark, mark. That's all it is. So it barely slows you down. But here's
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   the reality of the corner marking method. If you go back to that book way later, so it's out of
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.680]   your working memories a year later, it's five years later. I've done this before. And you start
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   going through that book, looking for the pages that are marked in the corner, and then reading
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.640]   the sentences or paragraphs that have been marked in the margins. You will in about five minutes,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.320]   reconstitute all the important ideas from that book. So it's a very effective way of capturing
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.480]   that information. It's not in some fancy system where it'll automatically like show you all the
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.960]   quotes, but you get to them almost as fast. It takes a little bit longer to go through the book,
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.480]   but the information is there. So the low friction here is important because it doesn't
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.200]   prevent you from reading. In other words, if the effort required to read, you're just there
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.160]   in terms of what you have available. Corner marking note-taking barely changes that effort.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.720]   So it's not going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Hey there, I want to take a quick
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.880]   moment to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.040]   Without Burnout. If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.560]   to like this book. It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.400]   instructions for putting it into action. Now, if you pre-ordered this book before it comes out on
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:30.160]   March 5th, I have some bonuses I want to offer you as my way of saying thanks. These include a
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.400]   chapter-by-chapter audio commentary from me, the author, and a crash course that will teach you
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.120]   how to put the ideas of slow productivity into action in your own life right away. So to find
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:51.200]   out more about the book and how to redeem your pre-order bonuses, check out calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   Everything you need, you can find there. All right, thanks. Let's get back to it.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.680]   You'll still read that book. On the other hand, it is still going to be effective for getting
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.080]   the information you need. The one shortcoming, which I don't think is really a shortcoming at
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.600]   all, is that you still have to remember, "Oh, that book, vaguely speaking, had some important
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.480]   ideas about X." So later, when you need some important ideas about X, you do have to remember
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.560]   to go back to that book and then use the corner marking to very quickly hone in on where those
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:24.800]   ideas are. But as I mentioned before, that's not a problem. I want you to have to try to remember
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.640]   that book is useful. If you don't, it probably wasn't that useful. And remembering that book
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.120]   is useful allows you to then, and I do this all the time, even without remembering the specific
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.400]   quotes, use the gist of what I learned from that book in the schemas of knowledge that I'm
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.280]   constructing and modifying and growing in my head. So that's not really a bug, but a feature.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.880]   You do have to remember some about what's in what book, but you can do that. You'll become a better
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.560]   reader. You'll become better at remembering and connecting books without having to reference
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.480]   your system. And when you need the specific examples, this very simple system will get
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   you there very fast. All right. So that's the part one. Part two, projects. Now, typically,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.000]   what I'm thinking here is professional projects, but we'll see this can apply to
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.680]   personal projects as well. So think about my life. I write books. I write articles
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.320]   for popular press, like magazines. I write academic articles. All right.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.600]   Where do I keep notes relevant to these things? It's like I have a book that maybe
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.480]   is due in three years. I'm not going to start writing it for another year.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   I come across a podcast interview and I'm like, "Ah, this is relevant to that book." Where do I
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.440]   put this? Where is my magic system that I put it? My approach is to store notes relevant to projects
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.880]   in the location where you will one day work on that project.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:56.320]   So for example, I write my popular press articles using Scrivener.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   So if I have an idea for an article, I'll create a Scrivener document for it. If I come across an
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.560]   article or a link or even just a brainstorm that is relevant to that article, I will go to the
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.760]   Scrivener project for that article. I will go to the research folder for that particular article.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:20.000]   I will add it right there. I write my books in Scrivener. So I'll have a Scrivener
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.360]   project for a book, be it a book that I've already been paid to write or a book I haven't even
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.760]   pitched yet, but I'm thinking I might one day want to write. And as I have ideas, I go to the
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.480]   research folder in the Scrivener project for that book. That's where I put it. And then when it
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.200]   finally comes time to work more seriously on an article or a book, everything potentially relevant
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.160]   that I've come across is right there, ready for me to use it. Low friction. I'm not gathering it.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.520]   I'm not navigating a system and hoping to encounter interesting ideas. I'm not hoping my system is
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.920]   going to write the book for me. Hey, just give me all the ideas. No, no, no. Ideas are hard.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.320]   You have to think really hard about what's going to make sense. The information needs going to be
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.240]   there when you get there. All right. It's not an elegant system. An article might find its way to
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.200]   a couple of different projects, but it works. Same thing for my academic articles. So as a
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.560]   theoretical computer scientist, my papers are largely mathematical. So we write them using a
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:22.720]   rendering engine called LaTeX. Any scientist knows about this. I use software for it called
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.160]   Overleaf. It's web-based software for writing these articles because it's collaborative. So
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.680]   my collaborators and I can write at the same time. I just put relevant notes for potential papers,
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.920]   create an Overleaf project, start adding sections and subsections.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.000]   Any ideas or notes I have about that project goes right into the document.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.560]   And then when it comes time to write that paper, we start adding sections to the beginning of this
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.400]   document, pulling stuff from later on. And at some point when the paper takes shape,
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.280]   we hide all the notes and we're left with just the polished paper.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.920]   You can do the same thing for personal projects. Wherever you plan a project, and this could be
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.360]   just like a folder in Google Drive, that's where you should go and put the inspiration pictures,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.640]   the ideas, the recommendations for contractors. Put the notes immediately into the place where
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.920]   you're going to one day do the work. Big believer in that for making effective use. And bonus,
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:23.280]   there's always a bonus to all these approaches. The bonus here is that every time you come across
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.320]   something new for one of these projects, I come across a link that's relevant for an article.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.640]   When I go to add it to the Scrivener research folder for that article,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.160]   I encounter again and again, everything else I've already found.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.680]   And that refreshes a mental picture of that project in my head and my head can do
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.600]   some more background processing. You know when some of the best ideas for my books or articles
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.520]   come? Like six hours after I add something new to the research folder, because it loaded all that
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.080]   stuff up again, my mind was like, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that." And then it's thinking about
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.400]   it and some new cool angle comes up and now you're rock and rolling and you get a real insight. So I
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.160]   think it's an effective system, but minimal friction. It's the easiest possible thing.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.240]   Load, type it in, out. All right, final thing. What about ideas about your life?
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.720]   Big ideas about living a more meaningful, sustainable, deep life.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:22.160]   I'm inspired by what I saw in this movie. Maybe I should get really into this particular hobby.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.800]   Where do you store ideas not connected to work or projects, but to your own life?
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.320]   Here, I think you should have an awesome notebook. This is where having a notebook
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.400]   that's actual form is cool and aspirational and just interesting to you is, I think,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.000]   important. This is where having a really cool pen is really important. So all of that fetish
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   that surrounds note-taking and systems, most of that is not applicable to your work. It can't
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.760]   keep up with the volume of stuff relevant in your work. You can bullet journal until your fingers
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.240]   bleed. You're not going to keep up with working on six New Yorker articles and three academic
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.520]   articles in a book per year. There's probably 400 or 500, maybe 1,000 different notes to get
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.840]   taken for that. You're not going to keep up in your paper notebook with that. But your life,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.280]   you can. Ideas about your life, you can keep up with in a physical notebook.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.160]   That's where you want the cool one. That's where you want the form of the notebook to matter.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.280]   For a long time, I used Moleskine. Long-time listeners know this. Earlier this year,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.560]   I switched over to a Remarkable. So it's a digital notebook, which I really love.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.520]   Again, it's ridiculous because it's like $500 or something, right? It's stupid. But I love it
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   because I have like 15 different digital notebooks in there now, and I could just go to any of them
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.480]   at any time. And I really love the technology. We did a whole thing about it on the show.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.040]   But whatever, the point is, it's cool and aspirational. To me, it's interesting.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.960]   That's where you have your cool notebook for keeping track of ideas about your life.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.040]   And all you need there is some sort of semi-regular process of reading through these.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.680]   The very simplest thing you can do if you're using a physical notebook
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:09.920]   is when you fill it, put aside an hour to review it, and to only copy into your new notebook,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.760]   short summaries of the most important or lasting ideas from your previous notebook. So there's a
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:23.680]   very natural triage you can do that way. See what sticks and what you lose interest in over time.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:32.240]   So that's my approach. It is low friction. It is simple. Very little custom software is required.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.680]   One cool notebook and whatever else you're already using for your work.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.760]   But because you're adding very little friction, you can keep up. And the stuff that matters will
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.840]   get captured and put to the place where it matters. And then, of course, you get all the bonuses.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.360]   So again, for books, the bonus is having to remember which book had what is a feature,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.840]   not a bug. It allows you to continue to work with and build on these ideas after you first
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   encounter them. When it comes to your projects, having your notes where you want to actually do
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.400]   the work is not just efficient, but it allows you to re-encounter the gestalt of what you know about
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.440]   that project again and again as you grow those notes, allowing your mind to work more with it.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:18.160]   And cool notebooks put you into that mindset of a cultivator or crafter of your own life.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.840]   So we're sort of hacking the brain here. We want the brain to be involved in the process of dealing
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.040]   with information, but in ways that doesn't overload it or overtax it. So that's my system.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's not as exciting as other systems. Some other systems, people actually,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.720]   make this clear disclaimer, like building systems. And that's fine. I mean, if that's like your hobby,
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.280]   I think that's fine. If you like building the complicated system because you get enjoyment in
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.680]   the system, you might actually take more notes because you really love the use this cool system
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.040]   you built. It's like when you build a pool and you customize it, you really want to have a lot
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.720]   of pool parties. So I get that. But if that doesn't appeal to you, don't worry. You do not
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.520]   need a super complicated system, but you do need something. So this is my suggestion. At least
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   that's one place to start. It doesn't really give us, Jesse, like a complicated software package we
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.240]   can sell. That's the only problem. - On our new Shopify store?
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   - Yeah. Our new Shopify store is going to have like a Moleskine, a Uniball micro pen for marking
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:25.840]   like the corners of book pages and like a Scrivener subscription. I don't know. It's not as fun.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:32.240]   I could rabbit hole on that stuff pretty hard if I wanted to. Like note-taking systems,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:41.040]   I could get going down there, but I resist. All right. So there you go. That's what I had to say.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.520]   All right. So we have some cool questions coming up roughly on this topic and some related. First,
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:53.680]   however, let's hear from some sponsors. Let's talk first about our friends from Cozy Earth.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:03.520]   Oh, I love my Cozy Earth sheets. This is true, Jesse. Last night I was actually noting this
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.800]   fresh pair of Cozy Earth sheets on our bed. And I was so happy to be in that bed. They really are
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.760]   so comfortable. I am such like a Cozy Earth cult believer at this point. It's really comfortable
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.800]   stuff. So what am I talking about? If you haven't heard me talk about it before, Cozy Earth, they
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   describe themselves as life-changing luxury. I agree. Cozy Earth bedding is the most comfortable
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:30.720]   bedding I have ever slept in. It has ruined me to travel. It has ruined me to the occasions when
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   they're dirty and we have a non-Cozy Earth pair of sheets on our bed. They really are that good.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.720]   They're bamboo. That's the material. It's 100% premium viscose from bamboo. So they're naturally
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.640]   temperature regulating and breathable. So you can sleep comfortably all year round.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.440]   They get softer with every wash. I think that's what's happening with mine. I think that's why
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.600]   I noticed it last night. I was like, this is getting really comfortable. They've been named
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.480]   on Oprah's favorite things five years in a row. Can't go wrong with that. They have a 100 night
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:07.120]   sleep trial. So, hey, try it a hundred nights. If you don't like them, it's in the back. They'll
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.640]   give you a full refund. But you will because they are super comfortable. They also sell a bunch of
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.720]   other stuff, ultra comfortable loungewear, plush bath towels, and more. We own multiple Cozy Earth
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.680]   loungewear items of clothing. I will admit this because the comfort of the sheets you want to
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:30.880]   bring with you when you're doing other things. I am a huge Cozy Earth believer. So if you've never
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:37.600]   tried Cozy Earth, I've got awesome news. You can save up to 35% off Cozy Earth right now. Go to
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:44.320]   cozyearth.com and enter my promo code CAL at checkout for up to 35% off. That's cozyearth.com
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.600]   promo code CAL, cozy, C-O-Z-Y, earth.com and use that code CAL.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:59.280]   I also want to talk about our good friends at ExpressVPN. Look, if you're going online,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.120]   you need to use a VPN, not just in public, in your own, the privacy of your own home.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:09.200]   And here is why. Even if you're talking to an encrypted website,
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:16.240]   the header of your packets is plain text. And I'm using a lot of geeky terms here,
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.800]   Jesse. It's my only excuse on this show to use computer science talks. I'm going to. I'm going
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.120]   to lean into this. The header of your TCP/IP packets, which is something everyone worries
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:30.880]   about, it's plain text. So anyone can see what websites or services you're talking to,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.880]   even if they can't see what you're saying. So if you're in public, anyone with an antenna can just
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.080]   say, oh, that guy over there in Starbucks is, you know, spending maybe like a little bit too long
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.160]   on the Cozy Earth website. I don't know what's going on here. Right. They see it. But even at
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   your home, your internet service provider, they can get all the statistics on what services you're
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.880]   using, what sites you're accessing. They can sell that data and they do. Right now they sell to
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.400]   advertisers, but who knows what else they could do with it? VPN protects you from that. The idea is
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.160]   simple. When you use a VPN, instead of directly connecting to a site or service, you connect
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.920]   instead to a VPN server. You tell that VPN server with a special encrypted message that no one can
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   read. This is the site or service I really want to access. The VPN server does it on your behalf,
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.320]   encrypts the response and sends it back. The guy with the antenna at the coffee shop,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.520]   your internet ISP, they learn nothing about what you're doing. All they know is that you're using
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.640]   a VPN server to do something. Your privacy is then maintained. So you need a VPN server. And
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:39.680]   if you're going to use a VPN server, use the one I use, which is ExpressVPN, best in the business.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.640]   They have been around forever. It's easy to use. You fire up the app, click a button and it's on,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.440]   you use your sites and services just like before. All this happens automatically in the background.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.720]   You can use this on all of your phones, laptops, even routers. You put ExpressVPN on your router,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.400]   everyone who uses your Wi Fi is automatically getting this protection. And they don't even
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.200]   have to do anything. They've got servers all around the world. So wherever you travel,
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   there's probably one nearby, they've got a lot of bandwidth. So the connections are lightning fast.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:14.160]   ExpressVPN is the easiest way to get VPN protection. So secure your online activity
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:23.760]   by visiting ExpressVPN.com/deep. Today, that's e x p r e s s vpn.com/deep. And you will get an
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:33.120]   extra three months free, but only when you go to ExpressVPN.com/deep. All right, let's move on to
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:40.240]   some questions. What do we got first today, Jesse? First question is from Margo. I'm a mother to a
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.600]   nine month old, and also work as a professor at R1 University. Right now I have a lot of time when
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:50.560]   I'm doing something that engages my hands or body, but not my mind, often at least five hours a day
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.280]   between mother and house duties. I have good and bad days on what I do at this time. Any
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.480]   suggestions on how best to use it? Well, I'd be careful about this idea
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:06.880]   of best using it. Because what we're talking about is just time you're not working.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.240]   So another word for that is your life outside of work. So when you say, "How do I best
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.960]   use my time outside of work?" You're really asking, "How do I live well?" In some sense,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.760]   it's a huge question. And what I'm worried about here is that the type of organizational
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.880]   productivity thinking we might apply to your work as a professor is going to bleed into this work
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:39.440]   outside of your job as a professor. But life outside of work is about a lot of different things,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:45.920]   many of which have very little to do with the efficient use of your time and resources.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.080]   So I don't want you to think about optimizing your time outside of work. I don't even want
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.320]   you to evaluate your time outside of work. And what I'm trying to do here is not critique,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:04.560]   but give you an excuse to relax about this. That's saying it's okay. Not excuse, permission,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.640]   let's say, giving you permission. You say you have good or bad days with what you do with this time
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.800]   outside of work. I don't want you to think about any of these days as good or bad. I want you to
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.960]   think about them as days that interesting stuff happened. You had a good moment with your kid.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   You blew off the whatever chore you were going to do because it was sunny and you went for a long
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:33.120]   walk with a friend. That's a good day. You read an interesting book. This is the permission I want
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.520]   to give you, Margo, is work is hard. So be organized so you can get as much done as possible
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.480]   in a small amount of time and have flexibility, not be stressed out outside of work. We just
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.760]   roll with it. It's not good days. It's not bad days. It's intentional days. And sometimes
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:57.440]   intentional is like, I am going to get after, we got to get the cars oil changed and I got to get
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.520]   the forms in for the kids' camps. And maybe it's a day where you're really getting through a lot
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.960]   of stuff. Intentional might be, I'm not touching the thing of chores. Like me, I'm taking the baby
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   and we're using the ergo and we're going hiking. So it's not good. It's not bad because it's not
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.280]   work. So let's think about it in a different way. And I'm basically talking to myself, Margo. So
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.240]   I'm using you as an excuse. It's not good days or bad days outside of work. They're just days.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.160]   So you and I together, Margo, can make a pact that we're going to relax. And dare I use a word,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.560]   oh, I'm going to hold up my book here. Go slower. So those who are watching or seeing me holding up
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.600]   slow productivity to the camera, they're slow down in our time outside of work.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.920]   All right. What do we got? Should I, by the way, Jesse, I'm doing a bunch of
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:52.960]   podcasts, you know, the promote the book. Yeah. Like I'm traveling out, uh, out West to do a
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:59.040]   bunch of stuff. I got to think of a way to subtly have slow productivity on the screen all the time
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.760]   when I'm on these shows. Just talk really slowly. Well, but I mean, I'm thinking like physically,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.840]   so like, like a necklace around my neck and the book is just hanging.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   And then like, if I use a little, uh, motor, like a servo motor, I can have the book kind of shake
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.880]   a little bit every once in a while because that draws the eyes. So that's what I'm thinking is
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.760]   like when I'm on like Andrew Huberman show, I got slow productivity hanging around my neck
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.360]   and like every minute it like shakes a little bit and maybe like there's like a red chase light that
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.320]   goes around it. That way I don't have to be, you know, talking about my book all the time.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.640]   It'll just sort of be there. Or here's my other idea for people who are watching. You'll see this.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.760]   I want to have like an articulated arm. And so behind me, it's on a backpack and battery
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.880]   powered backpack. So while I'm talking every once in a while, the book just kind of comes up from
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.800]   behind my back, kind of like on like an articulated arm kind of waves a little bit and then just
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.520]   descends back behind. That's what I'm thinking that way. I don't have to be like a self promoter.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:05.680]   It also needs to get on a Pat McAfee's bookshelf on his desk. Oh, is that the key? He's is he,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.960]   who's the guy who stands up? That's Pat. That's Pat. Okay. Yeah.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.440]   Because he has books up there when he's reading a new one or whatever. And that gets a lot of eyes.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.520]   I worry if I was on that show, he would crush me on the head.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.560]   He just seems like a guy who could just be like, boom, and just like crush you on the head.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.920]   Well, he's a kicker. I don't think he's like that big of a guy. He's probably pretty big.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.480]   He's like a strong guy. Yeah. I mean, you go sleeveless on your national show,
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   your televised national show. There's some confidence there. I don't do a lot of sleeveless.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:46.480]   Maybe I will. No sleeves, fully articulated robotic arm that just raises the book behind my head.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.680]   All right. Enough nonsense. What do we got next? Next question from Pineapple. Can people with
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.280]   ADHD really improve their ability to learn new things and actually remember it?
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:03.360]   A hundred percent. Yes. So Pineapple, I want you to keep this in mind. If anything,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.640]   and what I'm basing this on is earlier in my career, giving advice when I focused mainly on
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.000]   student advice. There's a lot of the themes you hear today from me were back in the advice back
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.640]   then. I had an audience size and time back then that I interacted more deeply with my readers.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:26.400]   I would spend an hour to a day actually just helping students who would email me and I would
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.760]   help them apply their advice. A lot of students I heard from, it was non-trivial percentage,
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:38.400]   had ADHD or some other type of neurodivergence. And what I heard from them is it is more important
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.520]   for us to be thinking intentionally about these things than other people. And in particular,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.000]   the general approach of being more structured about your time makes a big difference,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.720]   especially with ADHD. Very intentional and structured about when I work on this,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.760]   how I work on this, what systems I use to work on this. That is very important because you're
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.560]   minimizing the need for you to have to latch your attention onto the objective
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.560]   in an ad hoc fashion, bypass other distracting influences and focus on it.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.080]   And sometimes what I've heard from the, again, these same students is having that structure
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   that worked well with ADHD turned it into more of a superpower because now what it allowed them to
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.560]   do was to activate hyper-focus on a regular basis. When you have the structure, I'm going to work on
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.320]   this. Here's how, when I work on it, the distractions are out of here. You could turn on
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:37.680]   the flip side of some of the ADHD is the flip side is the ability to focus incredibly intensely.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.880]   And then you would get these super deep work sessions. So you could unlock almost like a
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.520]   cheat code that other people didn't have. Now, I want to condition this by saying the other thing
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:53.040]   I learned working with students who had ADHD or similar neurodivergences is there was also very
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:59.280]   specific things they had to do. Very specific ways they modify, for example, my study advice
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   to fit better with the best practices for ADHD. And typically this was working with
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.720]   the counselors or doctors that were already helping them with ADHD.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:16.960]   So you have to sort of customize this advice with best practices for this particular context.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.640]   But I've heard a lot that, yes, you do want to worry concerns about distraction and a bias
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:32.080]   towards structure and intentional systems for your attention. This is like really powerful.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.560]   If you have ADHD, even if you have to modify the types of things I talk about, the more
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.920]   realistically fit your triggers and what works with you, it's worth going down that path.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.240]   You don't want to just open yourself. Like I'll just figure it out.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.920]   Right. You don't want to abandon having structure or advice when it comes to your attention,
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.120]   because that's when things get hard. I remember, Jesse, when I had to finally make the decision,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.000]   I can't answer these emails anymore. It's kind of traumatic. It just, there are so many,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.520]   it just grew as the books grew and it became too many. And I was trying to answer some,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.320]   but that was hard. And finally I had to just not answer any. Yeah. Yeah. I remember it was
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.040]   traumatic. It was nice. There was like kind of a glory period where my audience, I could like fit
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.640]   my audience into an auditorium. Like we knew each other and I really could. And I learned a lot,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.360]   you know, doing like this one-on-one, a lot of one-on-one work is really useful.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.720]   So I sort of missed that. All right. What do we got next?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:36.240]   Next question is from Jason. There's been a lot of talk lately about declining attention spans
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.960]   and the dwindling ability to actually learn things. I recently read Gloria Mark's book,
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.160]   Attention Span. I'm interested to know your thoughts on Gloria's four myths of attention span.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:52.720]   I like Gloria's book. I blurbed her book. I think my blurb is on the cover of that book.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:59.760]   I have them here. So you can find her four myths of attention span at her website,
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:10.560]   GloriaMark.com/attention-span. So the book has four myths of attention span. So four things that
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.000]   we think is true about attention, but are not. That's what Jason's asking. So let's go through
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.960]   these one by one. And then I'll tell you whether or not I agree or not that this is a myth.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:28.560]   All right. Gloria's first myth, we should always strive to be focused and should feel guilty if we
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:36.640]   can't or can't be. Yeah, I completely agree with that. That's a myth. To strive to always be
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:43.520]   focused is absurd. It's like talking to someone who wants to get stronger or an athlete and be
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:49.120]   like, you should strive to always have your muscles in a state of load bearing strain.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:54.800]   That's crazy, right? There's only so much load bearing strain you can do. Like modern
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.240]   bodybuilding orthodoxy says, really, you want to have eight to 10 sets per week per muscle group,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.600]   right? Like otherwise it's overload. So just because you need to know how to put hard strain
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   on your muscle and do it on a regular basis to get stronger, it is obviously a reducto ad absurdum
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.160]   to then say, therefore it is good to always have your muscles under strain. Same thing with
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.520]   attention. Focus is important. You need the focus to produce things of true value using your brain,
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.280]   but to then extrapolate from that to say you should always be in a state of focus is absurd
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.640]   because that's impossible. So I agree. That's definitely a myth. All right. Gloria's second
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:39.120]   myth, mindless activity that we do on our computers and phones is wasteful of our time.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.360]   Now I agree here as well. I'm going to draw from my book, Digital Minimalism to tell you what I
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.840]   believe. So the whole premise of that book, like why did I write that book? Not because I believe
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:58.560]   there is some intrinsic evil in particular activities, but because my readers and
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.960]   listeners were reporting to me, I am spending more time on these activities that I know is
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:13.200]   useful or healthy. This is when distractions become a problem. When you know they are keeping
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.880]   you away from things that are more important, that they are lowering the quality of your life.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.400]   That's when you say this is a problem. And that was the problem people began feeling around 2016,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:28.560]   2017, this tipping point where more and more people who bought their iPhone in 2010, because
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.800]   they saw the Steve Jobs speech about having your iPod and your phone combined, like that's awesome.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:38.240]   Woke up seven years later and said, I'd checked as 150 times a day. I'm not paying attention to my
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.680]   kids. I'm not socializing anymore. I feel strung out and anxious. I'm not doing the activities
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:50.160]   that used to matter. That's the problem. So there's nothing intrinsic. This is evil to look at it.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.400]   It's I can't help but look at this when I'm trying to do bath time with my kids.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.960]   That's when it becomes a problem. Good analogy here would be something like alcohol,
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.520]   right? Same thing. It's not, Hey, you should never touch alcohol. That's bad.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.840]   But what's the cliche about it? When does it become a problem when it's messing up your life?
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.120]   And I think that's what happened for a lot of people with their relationship with their phone.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.560]   So yes, you want to measure technology from your values. Is it helping or preventing me
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.120]   from doing the things I care about? So it's perfectly fine to have perfectly distracting,
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.560]   low quality things in your life. As long as it's not having a footprint that keeps you away from
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.680]   things that you value promise for a lot of people they do. And then the real problem becomes when
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:40.720]   we look at kids because they can't help it. I'm yet to find a 13 year old who you give
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.560]   unrestricted access to the internet with on their phone. And they're like, I use this a little bit.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:50.800]   You know, I want to go outside and play. Nah, you're a kid. That thing is going to brain worm
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.040]   in there. So we got it there. We have to have some more protection. All right. But so far I'm on
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:01.200]   track here with Gloria. All right. Myth number three, the inability to focus on our devices
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.840]   are due primarily to notifications and our lack of discipline. That's an interesting one.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:15.760]   I agree with the notifications piece. That's like 2003 thinking notifications are the problem.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:22.400]   I get the notification that I have a new email and that's the problem. And if I just turn off
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.120]   my notifications, I'll be fine. No, that's crazy. We come back to these things again and again,
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.920]   not because we were notified, but because what they're offering us, whether we were notified or
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:40.800]   not. And it is a complicated picture when it comes to work. You can turn off your email notifications,
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.200]   but you're still going to check that inbox once every six minutes. Why? Because of the hyperactive
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   hive mind mode of collaboration. This is the core of my book, A World Without Email.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.240]   We work out so much of our collaboration through asynchronous back and forth messaging.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:40:00.880]   These conversations required many back and forth messages. They're timely. So now I have to keep
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.520]   checking my inbox so that I can see your most recent message and bounce it back to you. So you
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.480]   can bounce it back to me and I can bounce it back to you and get an answer before lunchtime.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.760]   So we check our work email all the time in this example, not because of notifications,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   but because we have a collaboration method that requires us to constantly check this work email,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.160]   because that's how we keep these asynchronous conversations going.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:26.960]   On our phones, it's more complicated. I don't go back to Twitter compulsively if I have a
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:33.120]   problem with Twitter because of a notification, but because of what it gives me. It presses these
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.520]   emotional buttons. There's an addictive design element to it. I don't need a notification to
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:43.760]   grab a cigarette if I'm addicted to smoking. It's already wormed its way into my rhythms of the day.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.640]   So yeah, notifications have nothing to do with it. Discipline is complicated.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:53.680]   Often directly speaking, it's not discipline. I can't just fix my email problem by being
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.440]   disciplined. I'm not going to check my email. The whole structure of my work requires me to do it.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.480]   So I have to put in place an alternative structure collaboration that does not require email.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.360]   A little bit harder when it comes to your phone and in some ways a little bit easier.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.400]   Yes, I agree. Just white knuckling it. I don't want to look at these digital cigarettes is hard
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.040]   because they're helping you paper over voyage in your life. They're giving you emotional stimulation.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.640]   They're scratching deeply human urges you have in a very superficial way,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:24.160]   but you need to scratch those urges and it's easier to be seeing something on social media
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.680]   or pornography than it is to actually fulfill those human urges with real relationships with
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:36.240]   real people. But there is a discipline aspect to that as well, but it's just indirect.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.360]   It's the disciplined construction of a more intentional cultivated deep life
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:48.320]   that begins to make the superficial pleasures of the attention economy superficial and
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.680]   optional. It's that disciplined effort to actually build into your life. What really matters
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.320]   to get a taste for it that makes the digitized junk food no longer appealing. So ultimately
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:07.360]   discipline will be involved, especially with the non-work digital life, but it's not the obvious
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.920]   discipline of just avert my eyes and grip my knuckles. It's a more indirectly subtle,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.880]   relentlessly applied discipline to build a life where you don't just avoid those things,
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:23.840]   but you find them increasingly intolerable. So look at that like I 80% agree.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.320]   Number four, fourth myth, flow is the ideal state we should strive for when using our technologies.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:37.120]   Yeah, I agree. Flow state, be wary. It's overrated. We have this argument a lot. Flow state feels
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.920]   great. And there are certain times in work where a flow state feels great, for example,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.640]   but also there's a lot of important work activities that are not a flow state. It's pulling teeth. Why?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.000]   Because you're straining your brain to do something that is past your comfortable ability, which is
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.800]   critical. If you want to get better, produce your best work flow state requires that you get,
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.280]   you fall into a zone, which requires that you're like right in the sweet spot of like, I have to
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.480]   focus, but I can do this pretty well for the guitar player. Flow state is when you're playing a hard
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:11.200]   song. You can play well, it's great. You get lost in it. Your fingers are doing it. Deliberate
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.800]   practice is when you were learning that song in the first place and you couldn't play it fast
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:20.240]   enough. And that feels like the opposite of flow. You feel every second when you're trying to,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:25.360]   with your full concentration, do something you cannot yet do comfortably. So flow state's great,
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   but it's not the be all end all goal. When it comes to technologies, Gloria's right.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.560]   Be very wary, especially addictive video games want you to get into a flow state because you
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.560]   look up seven hours later and you've been focusing on that thing all day long. They want to just pull
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.040]   you from one experience to another. There's no more purified example of a flow state than the
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.240]   TikTok interface. Swipe, swipe, swipe, swipe. You know, just, oh, here's something, here's
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:56.080]   something that's not good. Oh, that was really good. This one wasn't, but if I swipe some more,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.920]   I should get some more. They get you lost in this flow state. So there you go. They've just gathered
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.760]   three hours of data on you. So Gloria's right. In technology use, flow state's not the goal.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.840]   In work in general, flow states are great, but they're not the only thing that's good. So I think
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.800]   we sometimes, we probably sometimes put too much popular emphasis on them. And by the way, Mahaly
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.920]   Chaksetmehy would agree with this, right? I mean, he, he, he studied these very specifically,
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:27.360]   the context of psychology. He wasn't saying you should be in a flow state all the time. He,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.240]   he said, there's a very observable thing that's important and we can measure it and we should
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.600]   understand it. But people took it and said, flow state's all that matters. So some wisdom in those
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.920]   So thank you. Who asked this question? Jason. Good question. It was a chance to go over Gloria's
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   four myths. And I recommend that book attention span. If you read my book, World Without Email,
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.240]   I have a whole long section on Gloria Mark. I talked about her, her whole story. I've interviewed
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.960]   her on multiple occasions, really one of the top thinkers on attention and distraction. So
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:02.400]   definitely check out that book. If you're a fan of what we talk about here. All right. What do
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.160]   we got next? Jesse. Next question is from Ramiro. I'm working on my dissertation with a full-time
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.040]   job and need help on my reading and writing. Some days it's almost impossible for me to be able to
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.520]   concentrate. I read and reread to no avail. Time-blocking has helped, but I still get
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.480]   distracted. How can I concentrate better? Well, first of all, Ramiro, don't feel bad.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.320]   This is hard. You're doing something that's like very difficult. Now, because of my line of work,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.680]   I encounter more people who write dissertations under unusual circumstances than the average
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.120]   person. So I sort of hear a lot about this and it's really hard. And I want you to think about
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.320]   this like, I don't know, you're training for a marathon while you also have a busy executive
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.960]   job, right? It's hard to do and it's not always going to go well. So first thing I want to do is
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.800]   just tell you you're doing well and not every day is going to be great. And actually what you're
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.560]   doing is really hard and you can't just expect I have my system and every day is good. So we're
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:06.560]   okay. Now, beyond that, what tends to help? Well, if you're going to tackle this really hard thing,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   I think my marathon example is a great one because how do people who are busy,
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.520]   who train for marathons, and I know people like this, I've got friends who do this. My sister's
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.720]   a big marathon runner. They do it in the morning. It's the only thing that works. It's the only time
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.080]   they get up early. It sucks though running in January at like five in the morning is a great
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.480]   alarm clock. So keep that in mind, but it's the only time that they can consistently,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   they know consistently how they're going to feel like kind of tired, but they haven't used their
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.160]   brain at all. There's no decision to be made. There's no work to do yet. They just go out and
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.960]   they do it. That's how people train for marathons. This is what I see for dissertations and full-time
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:48.640]   jobs. If it's a busy job, you got to get up earlier and have like a 90 minutes, a two hour block in
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:54.480]   the morning, full ritual locked in, then you're done. That you can be consistently successful with
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:59.600]   probably 80% of the time. It's going to be a much higher hit rate than trying to fit dissertation
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.400]   work into your day later in the evening or try to make time for it after your brain is exhausted
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.080]   from everyday work. Here's the thing. If you have an office job, for example,
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:14.880]   one hour of the avalanche of context switching caused by the hyperactive hive mind workflow,
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:20.160]   the having to check your inbox once every six minutes, one hour of that is going to torch your
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:28.240]   brain. Like try to work on a dissertation. Here's my experiment at 8am first thing you do, or at 10am
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.880]   after an hour of hyperactive hive mind, you are going to feel about 50 IQ points dumber
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.920]   in that second scenario. If you're doing this at the end of your day, after hyperactive hive
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:44.000]   minding all day long, sending and receiving 126 emails, pretty soon your dissertation is going to
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:52.560]   start to read like a third grader wrote it. Pretty soon your reappraisal of Thomas Aquinas's just war
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.160]   policy is going to have a whole long section where you're just transcribing the lyrics from that song
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:04.560]   war. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. It'll just be that for a few pages.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:12.080]   Then your advisor will be like, "Ramiro, this appendix here full of pictures of tanks you drew."
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.640]   You'll be like, "Yeah, I did a different camo pattern." This is nice, but I don't understand
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.920]   how the enlightenment reappraisal of Thomas, Thomastic scholarship on just war really plays
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.080]   in here. That's what it's going to be like. You got to get to this before work melts your brain.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.160]   You got to do it in the morning. That'll actually work, but you need ritual, you need structure.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.440]   I'm going to give you a reading assignment here, Ramiro. Get my book, Deep Work,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:43.600]   searching the appendix for Brian Chappell. You're going to find a story in there about Brian
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.280]   writing his dissertation while having a full-time job. I did in the morning, but I want you to focus
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:57.760]   on the specificity of his rituals. He had it dialed in to the point of when he went to the bathroom.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.440]   Having that ritual, here's where I work. I do this and I make this one cup of coffee,
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:07.120]   then I work this long. That allowed him to just make constant progress,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.000]   no matter what else happened in the day. It's like running a marathon, Ramiro. You got to get up and
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.960]   lace up your shoes before the sun comes up. It's the only way to do it. All right. Let's do one
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.360]   more question here. >> I was dying about your
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.120]   description of John Hicks. >> That's where you end up, man. Where
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:29.680]   are you after five hours? We're podcasting today at the end of the day, and the only thing that's
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.880]   saving us is it was a teaching day. On teaching day, it's like I'm in front of the class and I'm
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:40.560]   not doing email and stuff like that. It's the only thing saving us from this turning into like
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:46.320]   a Joe Rogan type podcast. I'm not sure. He's a good interviewer, but you know what I mean. I'll
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.640]   just start going off my gut and talking about kettlebells or whatever. The only thing saving us
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:56.080]   is I didn't do a lot of email today. >> You also have your strategies in place
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.280]   where you don't fall victim to the hyperactive high of mind, right?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.960]   >> Well, that's true too. That's right. That's right. What I'll usually do is just consolidate,
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.680]   and it can be a beast because I have a lot going on during book launch time. It's like a two-hour
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.960]   block where it's just like, "Rah." I get on top of everything and then I ignore everyone for another
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.840]   week. You don't want to talk to me after that two-hour block. I usually just go exercise after
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.360]   that. But yeah, that's how I do it. I'll do these mega blocks and then just be a bad emailer for
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.200]   four days. >> Have you still been doing the
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.520]   labeling technique that we talked about on a prior show?
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.680]   >> Right now, it's just like the water's coming to the ship and I'm just down there with the
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:40.640]   bilge pump. Because book publicity is like everyone needs everything at the same time that your normal
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.040]   job's going on. And everything else normally is happening in your life, and it's all happening
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:50.960]   at the same time. The good thing is, because it's my eighth book, I've done this before,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.480]   I've designed these systems for my publicity teams, these interactive protocols, how we
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:03.520]   interact and do all the work. So I have it dialed in. So I've really minimized the urgent
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.240]   communication and how I do it. That'd be a very narrow book. I should one day write a book about
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.520]   the systems I use to help publicize books without burning out. That's a small audience book, Jesse,
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:19.120]   but I've given that a lot of thought. All right, what's our final question?
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.200]   >> All right, we have Caitlin. I always have more work than can fit into the two to four hours I'm
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.280]   comfortable working. I'm seriously struggling. I'm pretty good at time blocking my mornings and
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.480]   get a minimum of one to two deep work hours in every weekday. But once I take a break,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.520]   I find it nearly impossible to get back to work. Even when I try to regulate simple tasks such as
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.280]   admin work and grading to the afternoons, I struggle. How can I turn my afternoon time
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   blocks from 100% wasted time to time I'm actually accomplishing something?
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:56.320]   >> I'm thinking math. What's going to sharpen your mind and get you that energy you need?
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.480]   Good afternoon, hit a math. No, Caitlin, I've got a good answer. And in fact, you're lucky
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.200]   because I'm going to label this question, our slow productivity corner question of the day.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.440]   This is the segment where I answer a question where the answer can come from my
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:21.680]   upcoming book, Slow Productivity, which you should preorder. Find out more at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:28.640]   So why am I going to treat this as the slow productivity corner question? Because I'm going
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:34.880]   to give you some nonstandard productivity advice here, Caitlin. Right. So what I'm seeing here
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:40.960]   is you're exhausted. You're getting to the afternoons and your mind is saying no mass,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:47.040]   right? I don't want to grade. I can't do any more email. It's exhausted, which I empathize because
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:51.120]   I get there a lot as well. We have the same job. Caitlin's a professor. I've been there before.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:59.360]   So I empathize here. This is not something wrong that's happening with you, right? So this is not
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:07.840]   a discipline failure or your system being non-optimized. I think this is your body and
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.640]   in particular, your mind telling you something about the current state of your job. It's like,
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:20.560]   this is too much. I'm not liking it. I'm losing that mojo. Now, this is very common. I think this
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.640]   is a common in academic jobs, a lot of other jobs too, just because you can kind of hit these points
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.200]   of stagnation where it's no longer fresh and there's nothing. So I think your mind is telling
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.120]   you something here. So here's my non-traditional productivity advice. Don't tell your chair
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:43.760]   and don't tell your Dean. Do less, end your work earlier, spend longer on things, give yourself
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.000]   longer times to finish things. So basically, and this is why I call it the slow productivity
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   corner question of the day, let's embrace some slower productivity. You're at a phase of whatever
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.400]   is going on in your life and your relationship with your work right now, that the pace that
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.640]   you're going, which was probably the like assistant professor, I'm going for 10 year pace,
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.440]   isn't working with you anymore. So what would happen if you took some things off your plate?
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:12.560]   What would happen if you end your day? I don't have to tell people this, but you're kind of
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.800]   winding down your day, three o'clock. What would happen if you're taking longer on projects?
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:25.440]   So you don't have to work on it as much. You get a few hours in the morning, a long walk,
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:32.000]   some admin, you see some students, like you're kind of checking out and getting into other
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.640]   things by the late afternoon. I think you're going to find a couple of things. A, it's not going to be
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:45.680]   as big of a hit to your output as you think. Because I think you're ailing a little bit
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.120]   right now. So your mind's probably not on board with anything you're doing right now.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.600]   And you're going to find, okay, I'm spending more time doing less stuff, but the quality is good.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.480]   And overall, actually, like papers are getting published and my class is pretty well organized,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.720]   and I'm just giving myself a breather. You might find your output is fine. Second thing you're
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:08.400]   going to notice is no one else is going to notice. It's subtle. It's just like you don't set up
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.240]   meetings in the afternoon. You're saying no to more requests for committees and journal stuff,
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:15.920]   but no one knows you're saying no more. Because remember, right now you're saying, no, I'm just
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:21.600]   making up a number to like 30% of the requests. It's like 30%. So people have experienced you
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.160]   saying no, you move that to 50% of your requests. Who's going to know that? They just know that
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.080]   sometimes you say no to me. Sometimes they don't. That's the way it was before. They're not doing a
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:34.480]   hidden Markov chain analysis here to try to understand what's the base rates of assigning
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:39.200]   positive or negative responses to my request. They're like, eh, whatever. Oh yeah, Caitlin
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:47.760]   can't do this. Let's just ask Jesse. People aren't going to notice. I would also couple this with
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.280]   a serious new non-work interest. I start spending a lot of time on that.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:00.880]   In the afternoon, kind of surreptitiously, let's reinvigorate your connection to life.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.560]   You probably want to, if we're going to throw things out here, if you're too much on your phone
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.880]   right now, it's a great time for an information diet. It's a great time to do a digital minimalism
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.280]   style declutter, change your relationship to your tools. That's going to help you, I think,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:19.120]   from a mental health perspective as well. When you are working, look for more adventurous places
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.240]   to do this. There's some articles I wrote on my newsletter and blog earlier in my Georgetown
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:29.280]   career where I spent more time on campus just before we had a bunch of kids at home and I was
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:36.960]   like, what else? Where else am I going to go? I would have these rotations of locations on campus
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   that I'd move through during the day to do my work. Some outside, some inside, some libraries,
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.640]   some benches. One of them was a picnic table in the woods. I would rotate through these things
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.360]   to keep work interesting. I was kind of interested and motivated, not just be stuck in my office.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:57.680]   So you're having like a, you know, careers have their equivalent of midlife crises, where
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.520]   you're past one phase, there's not a clear, exciting next phase, and your mind is like no
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:05.440]   moss. So that's what I'm going to say. Do less, end earlier, take longer, get some other
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:11.680]   interests you lean into, make the work you do do more exciting and adventurous. No one's going to
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.000]   notice. You might produce a little less, but just quality be good. It's not going to make a big
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:23.120]   impact on your career. And of course, read the book, Slow Productivity to get all of the details
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.760]   of this advice. You don't have to do that, but I do think you should slow down. All right. Let's
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:39.520]   get our theme music, Jesse. He just needs to listen to our theme music every 30 minutes.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:46.960]   Just hard to be stressed. I really like the cover of the book. Yeah. Yeah. The more I look at it,
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:54.720]   it was definitely really, I pushed for this. Yeah. I mean, I pushed it. The normal thing you
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:00.480]   would do for a Cal Newport book before this would be, it'd be slow productivity and big text,
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.560]   and it would be single color background. Yeah. Like maybe one little bit of iconography.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:15.440]   Yeah. Like a turtle filling out a to-do list. Just a turtle with glasses on,
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:22.800]   filling out a to-do list, like a sketch of that. It's kind of like on the nose. And I said, no,
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:32.000]   I was like, I want the cover to capture visually the emotional feeling of encountering slow
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.400]   productivity as an idea. So I was like, and we went through a lot of things on this and I kept
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:42.320]   insisting. And so this cover captures, like it's supposed to create a reaction. So if you're
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:46.880]   listing the cover, and you can find this at calnewport.com/slow, it's a path through the
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.520]   woods. And in the distance, there's a cliff with like a cabin up there and sort of mountains beyond
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.240]   it. You just imagine like walking through those woods, that cabin, nothing, there's no email in
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.320]   this world. You know, you're taking your time, but you're probably like writing something awesome in
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:05.680]   a field note notebook or something like that. It just captures that feeling of like slowing down,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:11.920]   focusing on what matters, producing stuff that's really cool and giving you an encounter with
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.760]   productivity as a concept that has almost no overlap with what we think about the term now
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:22.080]   in modern knowledge work, which is like email and busyness and to-do list and optimization.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.840]   So it's like, how can I give you a picture that makes you think about productivity,
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.320]   but it's a completely different way, like move your mindset completely different. So I don't
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.280]   know. We'll see if it works, but I felt good about it. So I'm glad it's working with you.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:39.840]   - Yeah. Yeah. I've been looking at it. There we go. Do we have a call this week?
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.400]   - We do.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.360]   - All right. Let's hear that.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:48.640]   - Hello, Cal. Sean here from Balmy, Miami. I'm finding particular benefit in my nascent
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:53.680]   application of the idea notebooks that you have suggested. So far, this approach seems to be the
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.560]   right way for me to attain what is otherwise an excess of ideas without letting them creep into
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.680]   my workspaces. My question to you, how do you go through your idea notebooks once you've completed
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:09.120]   the notebook? Do you reread page by page? That takes a while. Do you schedule time for it or
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.840]   does it somehow conveniently happen to you when you have a spare moment? And what does that process
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.200]   look like? By the way, Moleskine should definitely make a branded Cal Newport idea notebook.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.960]   Tropical regards and thank you.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:28.000]   - All right. Well, I appreciate this question from Miami. Appreciate that as well. So we put
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.360]   this in the show because this is an evolution of my thinking. Now the idea notebook idea was,
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:39.920]   hey, have these different notebooks for different categories of ideas. So you have a place to put
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.200]   ideas that you don't know what to do with, but you don't want to have to just hold onto it entirely
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.080]   in your brain. I do a little of this still, but as I talked about in the deep dive earlier in the show,
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.320]   ideas that are connected at all to an existing project or potential project, I now keep in
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.760]   whatever tool I use to work on those types of projects, right? So an idea related to a particular
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.880]   article, I'll just put into the Scrivener document for that article. So much more of my ideas now
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:14.960]   are going into the particular tool I'll use to eventually work on it. However, there are still
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.080]   ideas I have about my life or my business that aren't tied yet to a specific project,
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.880]   like something I'm writing where I can put it. And there I still have idea notebooks. It's just now
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.360]   they're all within my remarkable. So if I had it with me, I'd see there's a bunch in there,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.680]   but it was like working on ideas for the media business, like the podcast and like video. I have
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:44.400]   like a notebook to put ideas there. Parts of my life, I'll have a notebook specific for them. So
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:51.360]   I still have idea notebooks for what can't be captured in an existing work tool. So it's less
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.680]   than I had before. In terms of reviewing those, I review them when I need to. So if I'm thinking
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.840]   I want to figure out a plan, a new quarter is coming up. I want to figure out what's my plan
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.000]   for my media business. I'll go back and look at that notebook then. I have another notebook.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.600]   Like let's say this is not one I have, but let's just say you're really interested in
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.840]   owning a cabin. Like this is an idea that's interesting to you. And you might have like
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:21.280]   a notebook you've built up for ideas about where that cabin could be or cabin living or what you
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.760]   would do there. And that might be a notebook you really don't look at. You're just putting stuff in
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.960]   there until like years later, some sort of opportunity comes up. Like, Hey, we could buy
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.040]   some land. Someone like a relative is selling. I think we can put a cabin there. Ooh, let me
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:42.640]   go look at that notebook now. So I put those two pieces of my answer together. One, if you have
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.840]   ideas or information relevant to specific work projects or processes where there's like an actual
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.480]   tool you will eventually use to act on that idea stored in that tool, everything else you can use
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.960]   idea notebooks for, you can use moleskins, you can use field notes. They're smaller. If you have
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.640]   a lot of them and less ideas, you can use a remarkable, if you want to do it digitally.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.200]   And when it comes to reviewing them, review them when you need to review them. I know that
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.720]   sounds vague, but it will make sense. It will make sense once you get going.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.240]   Notebooks are a hard business I've learned. - Well, because the planner.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.000]   - Yeah, it's a hard business. I mean, it's just hard. Like it's, it's hard to make
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.200]   the details on making a notebooks are hard. Like what paper you use and, um, and it's low margin
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.840]   too, which is interesting. It's not a way to make a fortune. It's not a software company.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:36.960]   No, it's not an app that a hundred million people can sign up for. Uh, yeah, no, there's no notebook
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:43.280]   billionaires. I don't think Charles Moleskin just sitting in a private jet, just bawling out
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:51.200]   somewhere. It's all his Moleskin money. Um, let's do a quick case study. So someone writes in to
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:55.360]   give a more detailed account about how they put some of the advice we talked about in the practice.
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.760]   This one's from Jose. Uh, this is a work-related case study. So it's about email in particular.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.800]   Jose says last fall, I was in charge of setting up a quarterly project at work.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:12.080]   It required many of our volunteers to input a lot of data and for me to collect and design it.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:17.120]   At first I was acting on the hyperactive hive mind model and sending replies via WhatsApp,
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.920]   email, et cetera. Many people asked me tons of questions and I was going back and forth with
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.640]   them. After I realized that was happening, I drafted one super clear email with all of the
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.720]   information necessary and links to supporting documentation. And I didn't hear from anyone for
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.440]   a while. They just got their work done. Once they had clear guidelines and step-by-step of what they
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.520]   needed to do, we were into producing our second quarter content and people have already gotten
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:47.120]   used to what they need to do. So no more reminders. I love it, Jose. I call that process-centric
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:54.080]   emailing, uh, or in, or without email, I call that smart system design. You will default to just back
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.160]   and forth messaging. If there's not an alternative way that people can figure out what they need to
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:03.200]   do and how to do it. So create the alternative and it can be really easy. And that's why I liked
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:11.440]   Jose's example. It doesn't have to be, I coded from scratch, like a distributed system, uh,
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:18.880]   virtualized world in which we have AR based group visual collaboration. He just sent an email.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.280]   It was like, look, guys, I thought about this. Here's what we have to do to get this content
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.360]   together. So let's just, I'm going to write through, here's how we do it. Um, here's the
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:32.000]   guidelines. Here's the information. Here's where you put it. This is the process. It's all right
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.360]   here. So we can all kind of go off like adults now, and we have what we need to get it done.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:41.040]   It can be as easy as that. Sometimes just doing a process-centric email. Let me take five minutes
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:47.040]   to explain the process for how we're going to do this work. That five minutes can save five weeks
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.560]   of back and forth messaging. So great example, Jose taming the hyperactive hive mind with some
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.480]   common sense. All right. Well, I want to get soon to our final segment where I react to something
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:05.120]   cool I've seen in the online world, but first let's hear from some advertisers. I want to talk
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:12.000]   in particular about our friends at element spelled L M N T element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.880]   mix born from the growing body of research, revealing that optimal health outcomes occur
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.080]   at sodium levels, two to three times government recommendations. Each stick pack delivers a
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:28.560]   meaningful dose of electrolytes free of sugar, artificial color, or other dodgy ingredients.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:33.280]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore health through hydration and is perfectly
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:38.240]   suited for athletes, folks who are fasting or those following keto low-carb whole food or paleo
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:44.400]   diets. I had element the orange flavor, which I like right before I came to the studio today,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   I was teaching earlier, which means I'm expelling. You don't realize when you're talking,
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   you actually get very dehydrated and I wanted to hydrate up. And I really element gets me that
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.120]   with no sugar. Also, I like to taste. I will. Sometimes this is not the official use of it.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.720]   It was like later at night and I'm kind of bored, uh, you're bored in the sense of like,
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.080]   I'm just gonna start eating some junk. I'll sometimes put a little bit of element in the
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.440]   water and then it's like, taste it like, Oh, this is good. This is like, I'm drinking something
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.120]   interesting, you know, uh, but there's no sugar in it. So, so you don't mind it. So I'm a big
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.960]   element fan and a customer. So I learned about it through years ago. They were a sponsor. Now I buy
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:32.240]   it all the time. Uh, it's used by impressive group of people. It's the exclusive hydration
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   partner to the team USA weightlifting team, many Olympic athletes, professional athletes in the
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:45.520]   NFL, NBA, and NHL use it as do Navy seal teams, FBI sniper teams, and Marines. Jesse, I like to
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:51.440]   think that when like Jocko Willink does an Ellen element commercial on his podcast, he's saying to
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:56.560]   his listeners, like element is used by an exclusive group of communities such as, and then it's all
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:04.240]   my world, Peter science professors, productivity scholars, people who think a lot about sustainable
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.040]   living turtles, making to do lists, turtles, wearing glasses, making to do lists. Maybe we
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.880]   would have sold a million copies of that book. Turtles wearing glass. We had a lot of merch.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.280]   Great. I love on the nose stuff. Um, element also has a new hot version.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.080]   They're chocolate medley features, chocolate mint, chocolate, chai, and chocolate raspberry
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.480]   designed to be enjoyed hot. So you work out like I do in the winter. I mean, I'm a big believer,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.560]   Jesse, and I'm proud of this is you should work out year round and whatever the outdoor conditions
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.680]   are. So I just work out in my unconditioned garage. So when it's summertime, it's hot.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.960]   And when it's winter time, the, it's the big, it's so cold and you build up heat when you work out.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.160]   Yeah. I'll put on lifting gloves because the metal of the dumbbells are so cold, it hurts your hands.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.320]   Sometimes it's so cold that just the fingertips sticking out of the end of the lifting gloves,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.200]   they're freezing, you know, but I like it. Like it, it's a way to connect yourself
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.360]   to what's going on outside. What I'm trying to say here, Jesse is I'm as manly and cool
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.400]   as the NFL NBA, NHL and Navy seal sniper teams. I'm trying, I'm trying to be as cool. Um, anyways,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:11.440]   elements, great. It's the right thing to do. Don't do sports drinks, do element.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.720]   The good news is members of our community can receive a free element sample pack with any order.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:24.000]   You just have to go make your purchase through our custom URL, drink element.com/deep.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.280]   That's drink element, L N N T.com/deep. Keep in mind, they have no questions asked to refund.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.880]   So if you don't like it, they'll give you a full refund. Also want to talk about our friends at
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:43.360]   Grammarly. It'd be funny if Grammarly's a copy also said used by Navy seals, Marine sniper teams,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.880]   and the U S Olympic weightlifting team. And they probably do. It's a cool product.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.720]   Grammarly is actually one of the first sponsors that we had on this show. And for good reason,
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.480]   because writing is everything. How you communicate is how people perceive you.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.440]   It's how clearly you're thinking your thinking is and how clearly people think of your thinking
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.800]   in knowledge work. In particular, you have to be a clear communicator.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:13.440]   Grammarly helps you do that. It's like having a wisened editor looking over your shoulder
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.880]   on whatever device you're writing on and whatever app you're using,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.000]   helping you make that writing clearer and more effective.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.760]   They have any number of different tools to help you do this, including even AI enhanced tools
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.160]   that harnesses the power of generative AI to help you brainstorm ideas. But they also have tools to
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   help you change the tone. Hey, this is a informal. How do I make this more formal to give you
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.880]   suggestions about how to rewrite things, making sure that you have no mistakes in that grammar
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.640]   as well. Writing with Grammarly helping you is much better writing than writing without.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.240]   And you need that much better writing to get ahead in the world of knowledge work.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:58.400]   This is why 96% of Grammarly users report that Grammarly helps them craft more impactful writing.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.680]   Keep in mind, it works across 500,000 apps and websites. Any writing you're doing,
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:10.240]   if you're using Grammarly, it can work there and help you out. You can use their tone suggestions.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:15.120]   They'll give you personalized suggestions about what you might want to say or how you might want
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.200]   to say it better. It's very efficient to use. I can't say enough about it.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.800]   You got to communicate clearly. Grammarly will help you do that.

[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.880]   All right, let's do our final segment.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:52.480]   Typically, what we do here is react to something that we have seen online. Today, I want to react
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:03.040]   to sort of a funny coincidence that many readers helpfully sent to me. This was the day I sent out
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.720]   an email to my newsletter, which if you're not signed up to, you should be, calnewport.com.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.600]   Join 90,000 subscribers who get my wisdom delivered to their inbox every week.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.600]   Anyways, I had an email sent out today. Ryan Holiday had an email sent out to his newsletter
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.280]   on the same day. A lot of people who subscribe to both of our newsletters, because we have
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.120]   a lot of readers in common, like to send me our two subject lines, one on top of each other.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:37.760]   I'll load this on the screen now for those who are watching. This is a screenshot from someone's
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:46.320]   inbox. All right, so you see my email first says, "Subject line, Heschel on the joys of slowness."
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.600]   Then below it, you see the daily stoic subject line, "Try not to be so slow."
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:59.120]   So a lot of people had those come back to back. I will say, by the way, and I don't want to brag,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:04.880]   Jesse, but at least for this particular user's email inbox, notice the priority tag
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:13.280]   is activated for my email, but not for Ryan's email. So I like this reader. I like this reader.
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.400]   All right, so that's funny, right? Because I'm saying the joys of slowness. It was a post about,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:23.680]   I was actually drawing from A.J. Heschel, Abraham Joshua Heschel's book, The Sabbath from 1951,
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:28.240]   and these sort of interesting ideas about what it means to rest and its relationship to work.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.920]   But it's a real slow productivity type idea. And then Ryan's email said, "Try not to be slow."
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.160]   So let's get into it. I'm going to load up the actual article itself so we can take a look.
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.400]   All right, here we go. So those who are watching, you'll see it on the screen. I have the actual
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.640]   email, Ryan's actual email here, "Try not to be slow." It turns out he's not saying
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:57.360]   slowing down your work is bad. All right, as we dive deeper, of course, it turns out we're talking
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:04.080]   about two separate things. Ryan's email is actually really interesting. He starts with stoicism
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   talking about how Seneca watched Nero help to break down the Roman Empire with his erratic
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:21.520]   activities. And Seneca, for various reasons, just didn't really act on it or talk out about it,
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.000]   at least not until it was sort of too late. And then he connects that to the more recent book,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.960]   Empire of Pain, the Patrick Raitt and Keefe book about the Sackler family and the opioid crisis.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.400]   And he talks about the people involved with the production of these opioids,
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.120]   knowing something bad was happening, but being slow to act on it because, hey,
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.320]   they were making money and there was other benefits they didn't want to give up.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:53.040]   So Ryan's saying, when it comes to issues of the conscience, don't be slow. When you realize
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:59.440]   something that is happening is contrary to your deep values, act. Speak up, act out.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:05.280]   Even if it's inconvenient, you don't want to be slow to act. I agree with that. And it's an
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:12.880]   important reminder that slowness as a term is not a talisman. It's not magic. It's not everything
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.520]   should be slow. Slow is good. There's lots of things where you don't want to be slow.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.960]   Driving on the interstate, you don't want to be too slow. That's going to be a problem.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.760]   Reacting to a moral crisis, being slow there is going to be a problem.
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.360]   Being called slow from your teacher, that's probably a problem too, right? That means
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:36.000]   that's not good. You don't want to be the slow student. So we should be very specific then when
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.880]   we talk about slow. We use the term a lot, but we use it here to talk about something very specific,
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:47.200]   your pace of work, slowing down your pace of work. And here where we're using slow,
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:54.320]   we're not even, we're not even, what would you say, celebrating slowness so much as we are
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:16:00.480]   castigating the fastest that has become the new normal. When I say slow down, I really mean
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.520]   stopping unreasonably fast. What we call slow in my book, Slow Productivity, is what most people
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:14.800]   would call normal work until recently. So slowness here is a reaction to an unnatural fastness.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:20.400]   It's a reaction to pointing out something that is not good, that is not sustainable.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.920]   It's burning people out, exhausting them and rupturing their relationship with work.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.560]   So we're using slowness in a very specific way, and that's important.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   We got to be careful about jargon, especially jargon, where the term has an immediate appeal.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.160]   We have to go the layer deeper and ask, what specifically are we saying this word applies to
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:44.560]   and why? And do I believe it? Listen to my case for slow productivity before you sign on. Don't
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.600]   be quick to apply the term slow to other things just because you want to make merchandise with
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:55.520]   turtles on it, which I understand because it looks awesome. Looks awesome. But that's not
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:00.240]   an excuse to embrace slowness in all things. So actually, Ryan and I are on the same page here.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:08.240]   Conscious, issues of the conscious, don't be slow. Your work, slow the hell down.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.320]   So it really depends on the context. I'm actually, you know, Jesse, flying down there
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.960]   in a couple of weeks, hang out at Ryan's bookstore. We're going to podcast in person
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.080]   at his new studio he bought. So that's gonna be cool. So maybe we can get into that.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:20.720]   That'd be cool.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:23.040]   Yeah. So that should be, look out for that. I think that'll come out,
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.040]   I think near the book or something like that, but that's gonna be fun. I haven't seen the store yet.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.400]   You have to buy some, you have to bring an extra bag to buy some books.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.640]   I will have to, I will definitely have to buy a lot of books. Yeah. And as you know,
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.080]   Ryan is the one who tricked me into getting the Deep Work HQ because it was his pictures
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.560]   in March of 2020 of his bookstore. Then it was just an empty building, but his pictures of having
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.600]   a place to go during the early pandemic, I was like, we got to do the same. So I give him credit
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.920]   for, I keep giving him credit for the Deep Work HQ because I was so jealous and impressed that he had
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.440]   a place to go during those months where everything was closed, that it was a few months later where
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:09.360]   we signed a lease for this place. So I both tip my cap and shake my fist at you, Ryan, for now,
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.720]   that the HQ has been great. So it'll be good. I look forward to that. I'll let you know when
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   I get down there. All right, Jesse, that's all the time we have. Remember questions,
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:20.880]   especially calls, the deep life.com/listen, the links are at the top, report a call,
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.880]   send a question. We want to hear from you. I'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.840]   And until then, as always, stay deep. Hey, so if you liked today's discussion
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:38.720]   about taking smarter notes, I think you'll also like episode 271, which is about how to play the
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.360]   long game, not just of tackling the things that are urgent now, but setting yourself up for a
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.840]   cooler life, five, 10 years in the future. I think you'll like it. Check it out.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:56.880]   So in today's deep dive, I want to talk about the long game, what you can do right now to avoid
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.960]   five or 10 years in the future, having regrets.
