[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the eighth chapter, where we are dealing with
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.780]   this great incident that is recorded in the second half of that chapter, namely the meeting
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.200]   between Philip the Evangelist and the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   Most of you will remember the context and the story.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.800]   Philip, an evangelist and a deacon of the church, had been working in Samaria and had
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.240]   been working very successfully.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.080]   Large numbers of people had believed the gospel and had been baptized, and we are told that
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.400]   there was great joy in that city.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.600]   But suddenly an angel of God addresses him, telling him to arise and to go toward the
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.080]   south and to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza, which is desert.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.360]   And he went, and eventually realized why he had been sent there, for he suddenly sees
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.920]   a man sitting in a chariot.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.760]   He is this Ethiopian, a eunuch of great authority under the queen of the Ethiopians, who was
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   in charge of all her treasure.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.360]   He had been up to Jerusalem to worship.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.040]   You remember, having been brought up as a pagan, he had become a Jewish proselyte.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.440]   And so he had taken this long journey from Ethiopia to Jerusalem in order to get further
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.440]   help and instruction.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.440]   He still wasn't satisfied.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.240]   Paganism couldn't satisfy him.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560]   The Jewish religion clearly doesn't give him satisfaction.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.040]   So he has gone up to worship and to get further help and instruction, and now he is going
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.840]   home.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.800]   And there he is, reading out of the scroll of the book of the prophet Isaiah, which undoubtedly
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.720]   he had purchased in Jerusalem.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.800]   And Philip is told by the Spirit, "Go near and join thyself to this chariot."
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.840]   And Philip did so.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.760]   And when he reached the chariot, he put his famous question to this great man, this Ethiopian
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   eunuch.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.400]   "Understandest thou what thou readest?"
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.560]   Let me say it again.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.640]   That's the biggest question you'll ever face in this world.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.600]   "Here it is, the word of God.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Do you understand it?
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Do you know what it's saying?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.360]   Have you realized the meaning of its message?"
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.680]   This is the biggest question in the universe.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.480]   "Do you understand this?"
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.280]   Why does Philip put that question to him?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040]   He does so because he knows that the man's salvation depends upon this.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.600]   Here is the key to the very thing the man is seeking for.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   It's all there.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.120]   But Philip can tell by looking at him that he doesn't understand it.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.600]   He is perplexed.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.560]   And the man with equal honesty admits that and says, "How can I, except some men should
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   guide me?"
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.040]   And he desired, Philip, that he would come up and sit with him.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.720]   And do you remember Philip entered the chariot and found that the place of the scripture
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.160]   where the man was reading was this.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   Then comes the quotation from the 53rd chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah, which we
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   read at the beginning.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.240]   "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb done before his shearer, so
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.520]   opened he not his mouth.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.000]   In his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and who shall declare his generation?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.520]   For his life is taken from the earth."
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.400]   And the eunuch answered Philip and said, "I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this?
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.560]   Of himself or of some other person?"
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.320]   And Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him, "Jesus."
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.360]   And that's exactly what I'm trying to do Sunday by Sunday in this way.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.920]   Here it is, you see, there in front of this man is everything that he needed, but he doesn't
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.400]   understand it.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.200]   So Philip now expands it to him, starting with the very scripture the man was reading.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   He preaches unto him, "Jesus."
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040]   And you remember the result.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.840]   The man eventually, this is the lyrical picture that we have.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.160]   When they were come out of the water, for the man had believed and had asked to be baptized,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.600]   and Philip had baptized him, and when they were come up out of the water, the spirit
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.560]   of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.200]   And he, the eunuch, went on his way rejoicing.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.400]   He's become a Christian.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.520]   He's found what he's looking for, and he goes home rejoicing in it.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   My dear friends, that's what we're doing here tonight.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   We are not meeting together here just to talk to one another or to interest one another
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.560]   or to boil away an hour or so.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.120]   I'm here, and I'm sure you are here, because you're concerned about the whole problem and
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.160]   battle of living and of life.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.040]   We are all here because we know what it is to be like this eunuch.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.680]   And it's my privilege to, in my feeble way, to do what that, which Philip did to that
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.920]   Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   We are dealing with this same passage of scripture.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.960]   And I'm trying to show you its meaning.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.080]   Thank God the meaning is perfectly plain.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.000]   The scriptures make it plain.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.240]   And yet, you see, we've already realized certain things, haven't we?
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.280]   We've realized that natural understanding doesn't enable us to understand this.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.400]   That's obvious.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.120]   The world doesn't understand it tonight.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.720]   After the passage of all these centuries, with all the events of knowledge and all the
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.080]   understanding that science has given us, I'm quoting the modern men, "We are as far from
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.560]   understanding this as the Ethiopian eunuch was."
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   Why?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.240]   Well, because, as the Apostle Paul puts it to the Corinthians, "These things are spiritually
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   discerned."
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.040]   I've got to start with this.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.000]   This is the basis.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.240]   If you bring your own natural ability and understanding and think you can comprehend
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.480]   this, you're already completely off the map.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.840]   It is the Lord Jesus Christ who said this, "Except ye be converted and become as little
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.200]   children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God."
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.080]   It is modern men's sophistication and his fatal faith in his knowledge and his ability
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.920]   that is his greatest hindrance.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   And it is the part of the business of this preaching of Jesus and this gospel and this
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.480]   message to bring men and women to see that.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.400]   Now the best and the quickest way of doing that is to look at the thing that is prophesied
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.920]   and depicted in the 53rd chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah, the very thing this
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.200]   Ethiopian eunuch was reading about.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.040]   What is it?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:24.000]   The death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And that is the thing.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.400]   You see, the man puts his question.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.240]   It's a very good question and it gives Philip his opportunity.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.840]   Of whom speaketh the prophet this, I pray thee?
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.480]   Of himself or some other man.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.360]   Philip begins and preaches unto him Jesus.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.880]   He says, "No, no, he's not talking about himself.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.320]   He's not talking about any other man.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.600]   He's not talking about the nation of Israel.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.080]   He's talking about Jesus.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.760]   Didn't you hear something about this Jesus when you were up at Jerusalem the other day?
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.000]   Of course you've heard about him.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.120]   These things were not done in a corner.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.280]   Everybody's heard about him.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   This," says Philip, "is a prophecy concerning Jesus."
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.740]   And so it is, you see, a message about the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.320]   on Calvary's hill.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   This is the heart and the center of the gospel.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.800]   And yet, it is the thing about the gospel that people resent most of all.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.960]   It is the greatest stumbling block of all.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.920]   People are always ready to say they admire Jesus as a person.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   They like his teaching.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.720]   They think if only the world applied it, there'd be no war any longer in Vietnam.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.360]   There'd be no war anywhere else.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.080]   All would be well.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.560]   But when you tell them, "No, he doesn't save the world even by his teaching, but by dying
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.920]   on the cross," they resent it.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.120]   They reject it.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.600]   They're in trouble about it.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.440]   This has always been the greatest hindrance.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440]   Why?
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.360]   Well, we've been trying to show why.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   We've dealt with the superficial difficulties, the idea that it was an accident, or that
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.680]   it wasn't a mere action of his enemies and so on.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   Totally inadequate.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.840]   The whole emphasis here is that it's the action of God.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.640]   And then, we last Sunday night looked at another aspect.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.440]   You see, people get into difficulties about the cross, and they don't understand it.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.120]   Because they don't face it, they don't look at it.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.800]   They're always idealizing the cross.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.280]   They're doing the very thing that the Apostle Paul tells the Corinthians that they mustn't
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   do.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   He says, "You are making the cross of none effect through your philosophy."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.040]   People idealize it and make it something beautiful and wonderful.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   It isn't.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.840]   The cross is offensive.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.640]   And that's the thing that comes out in that 53rd chapter of Isaiah.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.840]   We looked at it last Sunday night.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.960]   The terrible suffering.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.160]   His visage was marred.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   The cross is ugly.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.960]   It is foul.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   It's terrible.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.840]   The agony, the suffering.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   We noticed the way in which it's all prophesied there, and the way in which when you read
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.600]   the latter chapters of the Gospels, you see it described in detail.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   The agony of our Lord, the agony in the garden, the agony on the cross.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.560]   The suffering, the intensity.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:31.840]   Now all this surely shows us at once that no superficial explanation of the cross is
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   adequate.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.080]   There is a great mystery here.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.040]   Why did he have to suffer such terrible things?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.960]   Why, I ask again, the cry of dereliction on the cross.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.400]   My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.640]   He seems inferior to the martyrs, doesn't he?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.880]   Yes, but you see, that's a part of the suffering.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.280]   It's a part of the message of the cross.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.720]   There's something profound here.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.360]   There's something desperate here.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.240]   There is something that demands that.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   What is this?
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:10.240]   Now that's the thing to which we address ourselves this evening.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:18.800]   I ended last Sunday night by saying that happened obviously because it had to happen.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.520]   God would never have allowed that to happen if the salvation of mankind could have been
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.360]   procured or effected in any other way, but it couldn't.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.480]   And here is the great question.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.400]   Why did that have to happen?
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.440]   Now it is because people don't understand the answer to this question that they're in
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.680]   trouble, but it's all here in Isaiah 53.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.560]   The Ethiopian eunuch was already reading the explanation.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.800]   He didn't understand it.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.160]   Do you understand it?
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.120]   Do you know why the Son of God had to die in that terrible way and why he was throughout
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.560]   his life a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief?
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.760]   Not your pale Galilean, not your aesthete, not your artist.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   No, no.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.720]   A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.680]   A man bearing these ills and diseases out of whom virtue was passing.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   Why all this?
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.720]   Well, the answer is here, or another way I can put it is this.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.680]   The answer is rarely in the cross itself.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.400]   But the trouble is, you see, that we talk about the cross instead of looking at it,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   instead of listening to it.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.840]   The cross speaks.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.880]   You remember the author of the epistle to the Hebrews says that we are interested in
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.440]   a blood that speaketh better things than that of Abel.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.560]   There is a message coming from the cross if we but listen to it, if we don't just drape
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.080]   it round and turn it into something beautiful that we can all admire and seek to emulate.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.000]   We've got to realize it's unique.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It stands alone.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.800]   There's never been anything like it and never will be.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   What is this?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:19.760]   Well, the answer, the first answer, generally the one we are dealing with tonight is this.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:28.000]   The first explanation of why he had to endure and suffer all that is the state and the condition
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.360]   of man by nature.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.080]   Here's the way we begin to understand it.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.360]   He was innocent, yet he suffered.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.640]   Why did he suffer?
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.360]   It is because of us.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.720]   He was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.680]   The justicement of our peace was upon him.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.440]   Now I want to put this to you this evening.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.800]   If you don't understand the meaning of the cross, the death of Christ upon the cross,
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   and why it had to happen, and why that in particular is the means of salvation, the
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:17.640]   main explanation of it is due to the fact that you've never understood yourself.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.880]   You've never realized the truth about yourself.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.960]   You've never realized the condition in which you are by nature.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.120]   This is always the first difficulty.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.480]   This is something that I could put to you in many different ways.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.080]   It is, if you like, the whole tendency of modern men to start with the New Testament
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.360]   and not to be interested in the Old.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.480]   And the moment you do that, you're already wrong.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.800]   The Old Testament is the introduction to the New.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.600]   There is a sense in which you can't understand the New except in the light of the Old.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.640]   You see, this was the very thing that Philip and Bertrand were saying to this Ethiopian
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   eunuch.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.800]   He says, "Look here, this great message, it's all one.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.080]   Here was a man given 800 years before these things happened in Jerusalem.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.840]   A man was given a preview of this.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.160]   It's a part of God's great plan of salvation.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.000]   God has been promising this ever since the fall of men, that he's going to send a great
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.600]   deliverer and he's going to deliver in a particular way, and this is the way."
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.600]   He preached unto him Jesus.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:34.200]   Yes, but you see, the Old Testament will tell you why he had to come and why especially
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   he had to suffer.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.880]   I'm not surprised that people don't like this aspect of the message.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:48.600]   It is again what the Apostle Paul calls the offense of the cross.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.080]   The offense of the cross.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.560]   The cross is offensive.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.440]   You let the message of the cross really come out and it'll offend men.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440]   It did so.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.880]   At the very time, they jeered at our Lord as he was dying.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.240]   Why did they jeer at him?
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960]   Ah, they caught something of this message.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.320]   Paul says that this message is a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.640]   It is foolishness to the Greeks.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.720]   The offense of the cross.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.440]   What is the offense of the cross?
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.360]   The death of a martyr is not offensive.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.440]   And as I say, we tend to admire it.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.800]   There are men who try to imitate and to emulate this, and the world applauds them and admires
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   them, self-sacrifice.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.080]   A man passively giving himself, not resisting.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.440]   See, this is a message that people like, but they're doing despite the message of the cross
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.400]   because the cross is always an offense.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.440]   And it is just here that the offense comes in.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.040]   Why did he have to endure all this?
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.440]   And the answer is in a little word, which is so vital in the biblical message.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.920]   It's the word, sin.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.280]   It's all due to sin.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.680]   It is all due to our estate and condition.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.380]   Let me divide it up for you.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.640]   What is the condition of men?
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.760]   Why did the Son of God have to come into the world?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.280]   Why especially did he die on that cross?
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.760]   The first answer is because man is guilty before God.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.200]   Now here, you see, is the beginning.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.160]   Here is the law, if you like.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.280]   But people don't like law.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.680]   They want love, they say.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.420]   They want a positive message.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:50.080]   You can't defend the positive message unless you first accept the negative.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.920]   Man is guilty before God.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.120]   Look at the words used.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.760]   Transgression, iniquity.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.200]   These are the words that are used, and they're vital words.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.160]   They're key biblical words.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.320]   And they're key biblical words because they bring home to us the truth about our self.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.800]   What do they mean?
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.280]   He was wounded for our transgression.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:26.760]   He was groaned for our iniquity.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.980]   You will not understand the cross unless you understand transgressions and iniquities.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.820]   You won't understand yourself unless you understand these words.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.440]   You won't understand the state of your world tonight.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.480]   Griefs, sorrows, that's the world we are in, isn't it?
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.760]   But why are there griefs and sorrows?
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.240]   Why are there wars?
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.760]   Is there anything more superficial than that men and women should just make a protest about
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.760]   the war?
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.240]   The thing we ought to be concerned about is what leads to it, what causes it.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.080]   And are you asking an intelligent person to believe that this can be explained in terms
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.440]   of an odd president or a prime minister or some odd number of men?
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   Of course it isn't.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.720]   It's much deeper than that.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:20.400]   It's a profound question and it is the whole question of men in sin.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:29.000]   Griefs and sorrows are the result of transgressions and iniquities.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.120]   And what you and I need to do is to consider this message and not merely to make our vapid
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.680]   protestations.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.240]   That's not Christianity.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.840]   That's almost a complete denial of Christianity.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   It's so superficial.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   It's sad.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.000]   It misses the whole point.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   It depicts Jesus as a passive resister, as a pacifist.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:59.520]   And it takes the whole glory out of the cross as well as the horror and the terror and the
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.120]   ugliness of this visage marred more than any men.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:08.000]   No, no, it's too superficial.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.800]   But here is the real explanation.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.840]   What is the meaning of these terms, I ask?
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.260]   Well, you can only understand that if you understand something about the biblical teaching
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.880]   concerning the law of God.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880]   And here it is.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   God has made us.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.360]   And he's made us in his own image and he's pledged us in this world.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:36.200]   But God having made us and God being God, he told men that you've got to live in a
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.680]   certain way.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.680]   God is the king.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.480]   God is the ruler of the universe.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   It is his.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.200]   Whether you like this or not, it's just the fact that the world belongs to God and
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.840]   he's made it and not us.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.760]   You see, with all our cleverness, we haven't made the universe.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.560]   It's God's universe.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.960]   And we haven't made ourselves.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.360]   It's God who's made us.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.440]   And he's given us laws.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.480]   And he has told us quite plainly that we are only happy and only enjoy life in this world
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.760]   as long as we are obedient to and conform to his holy laws.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.360]   How do I know what this law is?
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.720]   Well, I can tell you.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.400]   He's put this law within every one of us.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.520]   It's in our consciences.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520]   It's there.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.040]   Of course, you can try to explain away the conscience in terms of psychology, but you
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.440]   can't silence it.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.960]   It's there.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.760]   The law is written in the heart, says Paul.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:40.640]   But in addition to that, and over and above this, God has stated his law in an external
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.800]   and in an objective manner through Moses and the children of Israel.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   Now, that's where the Old Testament comes in.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.600]   You see, God made a nation out of himself.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.360]   The world had gone wrong.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.760]   And you have all the kind of trouble that you've got in your modern world depicted there
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.400]   in the Old Testament.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.840]   Think of the account of civilization before the flood, and you might very well be reading
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.240]   about the 20th century, the mid-20th century.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.520]   All the horrors of the world before the flood are all upon us today.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.880]   Now, there it is.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.240]   Man, you see, had ceased to listen to his conscience.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.200]   All the thoughts of the imaginations of his heart were altogether evil, says the sixth
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.960]   chapter of Genesis.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.200]   And so punishment came.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:33.040]   Well, now then, after that, God takes hold of a man called Abram, calls him out of paganism,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.320]   and turns this man into a nation.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   What for?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.080]   Well, very largely in order to speak to mankind.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.640]   He takes this nation in order that he might teach.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.480]   He gave them, again, as Paul reminds the Romans, he gave them his living oracles.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.080]   You've already come across that in the seventh chapter of this book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.000]   Stephen, in his great self-defense before the Sanhedrin, works that point out, you remember,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   in great detail.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.200]   Refresh your memories by reading chapter seven of the book of Acts when you go home.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:14.600]   God has done this in order that his laws might be perfectly plain and clear, so that if we
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.200]   don't listen to our conscience, we've got the Ten Commandments.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.680]   Now that is how God meant men to live.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.280]   There it is, the two tables.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:31.160]   Man in his relationship to God, man in his relationship to his fellow men.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   That's just an explicit statement under ten headings of how God intends men to live.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.360]   That is the law of God.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:51.200]   You only begin to understand the meaning of the cross when you start with that, because
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   the moment you look at that, you see at once that mankind is guilty before God.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:07.480]   This is the verdict, again in Romans 3, "There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.520]   The whole world lieth guilty before God."
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.000]   The whole world.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   Both sides of the iron curtain, guilty before God.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.400]   Doesn't matter what political party you belong to, doesn't matter what social class you belong
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:31.040]   to, doesn't matter if you're wealthy or poor, the whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.440]   This is the thing that matters, not the superficial divisions and distinctions.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.360]   Why does the whole world lie guilty before God?
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.960]   Well, it hasn't kept God's law.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.720]   There's the law.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.880]   The question is, have we kept it?
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.080]   You see, Paul again, you know the Epistle to the Romans is the great exposition of this.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.720]   And I'm certain that what Philip was doing was giving in his way this same great doctrine
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.800]   as Paul works out there in the Epistle to the Romans.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.120]   You see, this is it.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.400]   The Jews thought that the fact that they possessed the law put them right with God.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:21.600]   And Paul says it is not the hearer of the law that is justified with God, but the doer.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.400]   The fact that you know the law doesn't help you if you don't keep it.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.780]   And the trouble is that the whole world has not kept the law of God.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:36.840]   So that sin is defined in the Bible as sometimes missing the mark, not coming up to the standard,
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.120]   falling short of the position in which we ought to be.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.800]   That's a part of the guilt.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.600]   But it isn't the only part.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:53.420]   We have not only failed to live up to the standards and the dictates of God's law,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.580]   we have actually and deliberately broken the law.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.800]   That's the meaning of transgression.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.560]   Deliberate flouting of the law, deliberate breaking of the law, deliberate acting in
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.640]   an unrighteous manner.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   That's part of the definition of iniquity.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   Transgression.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:21.280]   There is the law's statement and we have deliberately broken it, we've deliberately flouted it.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:29.940]   That is transgression, the breaking of the law, and that done deliberately.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.680]   And this is another source of guilt.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:43.180]   But the most terrible cause of guilt is that in doing all this we have but been manifesting
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.580]   our rebellion against God.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.100]   Now, here's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:27:01.500]   The carnal mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.380]   can be.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:13.420]   We have all gone his own way, says this prophecy here in the 53rd chapter of Isaiah.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:18.900]   We've gone astray, we've followed our own ideas, we haven't listened to the way of God.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.300]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.980]   We have turned every man to his own way.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.420]   Now this means a deliberate rebellion against God.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.660]   My dear friend, you don't begin to understand yourself and your troubles and your problems
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.300]   and your unhappinesses and your griefs and your sorrows.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.900]   You don't begin to understand the whole case and condition of mankind and this world in
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:51.420]   which we're living tonight, unless you grasp this, that this is the original sin, the original
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.820]   temptation to man.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:59.620]   Here he is, made in the image of God and in paradise, and enjoying life in communion with
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:06.380]   God, and the tempter comes and says, "Hath God sinned?"
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.780]   You think it's fair of God to say?
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:14.420]   Hasn't God said this in order to keep you down and to keep you as but human?
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:19.020]   He knows perfectly well that if you only assert yourselves, you'll be equal to him.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.420]   And man rises to it, and he still rises to it.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.700]   Man thinks he's God, he wants to be equal with God.
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:30.380]   He knows as well as God, so he resents God's law and he defies it and he rebels against
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.500]   it.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:41.740]   And there is no greater sin than that sin of rebellion.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:48.940]   And man is as he is tonight, and the world is as it is tonight.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:56.900]   And the cross of Christ is as essential tonight as it has ever been, because man is guilty
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.060]   before God.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:06.940]   Man's well-being consists of his being blessed by God and in the right relationship to God.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.300]   But while he's a rebel and while he's guilty, he is not blessed by God.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:18.540]   Oh, you remember of this same prophet, Isaiah cries out in an agony, and he says to God,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.540]   "Oh, why are we as we are?
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.820]   What's the matter?"
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.820]   And he gives the answer.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:32.020]   "Thine arm is as is not shortened, nor thy near death that thou canst not hear of it.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.180]   But our iniquities have come between us and thee."
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.180]   And that is the answer.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.900]   My dear friend, this world wasn't meant to be like this.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:47.260]   This world is a manifestation of the wrath of God against the sin and the unrighteousness
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.700]   and the ungodliness of men.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.220]   God has said it everywhere in his law.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.140]   "And so that sin as it shall die, the way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.140]   It does matter how clever and learned you are, however wealthy and how sophisticated.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.340]   If you are rebelling against God and flouting his laws, if you are guilty of transgression
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.140]   and iniquity, you'll be miserable, you'll be wretched.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.300]   Grief and sorrow, here it is.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.780]   The guilt of mankind.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.140]   Here's the problem.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.700]   But it isn't the only aspect of the problem.
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.740]   Man I'm told here is not only guilty, but he's also lost.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:33.540]   "All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:38.060]   We have turned every one to his own way."
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.540]   Gone astray, we are lost.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.580]   And here again you see is the whole message of this book.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.620]   Man is not where he was meant to be.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.460]   The world is not as it was meant to be.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.180]   This is the first thing.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.980]   We've all got these sins within us.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.020]   It's a part of the restlessness.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.140]   But you see there's a misunderstanding as to what it is meant to be.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.060]   What the world thinks it's meant to be is this, that wars are banished so that we can
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:20.700]   all go on using our money to buy food and drink and sex and have a marvelous good time.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.660]   What a shame that Vietnam is spoiling it and causing trouble.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:31.540]   That's the world's idea, but it isn't God's idea.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.540]   We've gone astray.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.540]   We don't know where we are.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.860]   We are not where we were meant to be.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.260]   The world is not enjoying fellowship with God.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.940]   The world is unhappy, griefs, sorrows.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.740]   Sums up the whole of life tonight, doesn't it?
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.620]   The world doesn't understand itself.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.540]   It doesn't understand life.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.900]   It has no purpose.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.900]   It has no sense of direction.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.860]   It has no goal.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.860]   But you know my friend, the world was not meant to be like this.
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.740]   The world has gone astray.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.740]   It's missed the mark.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.740]   It's lost the root.
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:20.740]   It's in the wilderness.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:31.100]   And this is the whole tragedy, but this is the very essence of the whole problem.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.540]   That life has become pointless, purposeless.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.340]   What's the meaning of anything?
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.340]   What's the purpose of anything?
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.340]   Can't you see the confusion?
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.340]   Students.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   What are students to do?
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   What's the job?
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   What's the purpose of student?
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   What is a student?
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:53.420]   Well, I gather that the modern idea seems to be that a student is one who is to enjoy
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:59.580]   himself, and it is the business of the ratepayer to pay for the student to enjoy himself.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:04.420]   And if he isn't allowed to enjoy himself, he grumbles and he complains.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.980]   Is that your definition of a student?
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.220]   But you see, this is the modern idea.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.340]   We are here to have pleasure.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.400]   We are here to have enjoyment.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.020]   That means that the world and men have lost their sense of direction.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.900]   Man doesn't know where he is.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.940]   He's gone astray like sheep.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:30.300]   He's no direction, no purpose, no objective, no plan.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   He doesn't know where he's going.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:38.220]   All he wants is a bit of ease, but he realizes that even that is enough because men can't
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.700]   be satisfied with that.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.620]   There is that in men that cries out for something bigger, something greater, but he can't find
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.620]   it.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.580]   Well, there it is.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:54.780]   We have turned everyone to his own way.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:00.340]   And what an extraordinary definition this is of the modern world.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.580]   It's like the sheep, you see, have gone astray.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.220]   Can't you see this picture?
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.700]   Do you know anything about sheep?
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.580]   Have you ever seen sheep becoming wild, all rushing one in this direction, one in another,
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.420]   one going backwards, one forwards?
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:18.220]   Is there anything more foolish and ridiculous than a cloud of frightened sheep, each one
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.700]   rushing madly here under utter confusion?
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:26.940]   That's the picture that is given here of mankind as the result of sin.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.460]   That's why the Son of God had to come into the world, and that's why he had to die upon
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460]   the cross.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.100]   Handle is caught, he doesn't he?
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.300]   You remember the music that he wrote in order to depict this very aspect, all week like
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.220]   sheep have gone astray, the silly, nodding sheep, rushing backwards and forwards, no
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.460]   purpose, no direction, no escape, utter confusion.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:53.260]   But isn't that the world?
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:56.660]   The world is confused.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.780]   The world is bewildered.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:03.540]   But each is trying to find a way out.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.740]   Each is seeking for a way of relief.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.900]   And it's exactly like sheep, rushing one here, one there, one backwards, one forwards, all
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.900]   in different directions.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.620]   There's your mankind with all its learning and sophistication, but no direction, no answer,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.620]   no solution.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.620]   What am I talking about?
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.420]   Well I'm talking, if you like, about the false religions.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:33.260]   I'm talking about the philosophies, I'm talking about the cults, I'm talking about all human
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.020]   reasoning and all human ideas.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:41.220]   One says this, the other says the exact opposite, and here is mankind completely bewildered
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:43.420]   and falling back upon drink and drugs.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.940]   Can't be bothered any longer, nobody understands, there's no sense in it.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.260]   Tale told by an idiot.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.140]   That's the view of life.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:01.340]   All we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.580]   Man is lost, completely lost.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:12.620]   And all his civilization, all his educational effort, all his striving, he can't find the
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   way.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.980]   He's as lost as foolish sheep.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.820]   And he cannot find the way out.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:27.740]   So you see, man is not only guilty before God, he is lost.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.500]   But alas, on top of that, he is miserable and he is sick.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:39.060]   Griefs and sorrows, or again this picture of the sheep.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:46.700]   Our Lord, you remember, took up this picture of the sheep.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:54.500]   We are told there in the gospel according to Saint Matthew that he looked out upon mankind
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.300]   and that is what he saw.
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.940]   He saw them as sheep without a shepherd.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.460]   And he had compassion upon them.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:10.020]   When he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.660]   were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.620]   That's how he saw life in this world.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.140]   That's how he saw men.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.020]   That's why he came into the world.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.940]   That is why he later said the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:28.940]   What's he mean by this?
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:37.100]   Well, you see, this is his way of describing this grief and sorrow, this sickness.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.700]   As sheep not having a shepherd, he says.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.340]   He looked on them with compassion because they fainted and were scattered abroad as
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.060]   sheep having no shepherd.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.980]   You see the picture.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.140]   Sheep are absolutely hopeless without a shepherd.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.380]   It's a part of the foolishness of sheep.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.020]   They don't know where to go to find pasture.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.300]   So they're not adequately fed, they're fainting.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:16.180]   They're fainting partly and they're thin and they're scraggy because they don't
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.060]   know where the best pasture is to be found.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.180]   They always go to the wrong place and the shepherd's always having to bring them back.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.300]   They haven't got the understanding he's got.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:34.700]   So they're unfed, inadequate nutriment, because they're not being led by the shepherd.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.420]   Not only that, they've got no protection.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.580]   You remember our Lord again in depicting himself as the good shepherd.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:52.300]   He says, "I am the door, and by me if any men enter, he shall go in and out and find
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   pasture."
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.300]   It's all there.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.940]   You see, there's the picture of the fold.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.200]   And the shepherd leads them into the fold at night.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.780]   And having put them into the fold, he lies down across the entry.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.900]   He's protecting them.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:14.460]   He's protecting them against those wild dogs and wolves and other marauding beasts
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:19.540]   that used to attack sheep in the first century and in these other countries.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.780]   But the shepherd protects them.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.220]   He takes them in, he takes them out.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.220]   He gives them the pasture, but he provides the protection and the care.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.100]   And our Lord says, "I've come to do that sort of thing.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.620]   I am the good shepherd."
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.300]   But here he sees mankind as sheep without a shepherd.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.300]   And they're fainting.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   Why?
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.620]   Oh, because they're being attacked by these dogs and wolves.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.620]   What do you mean?
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:52.540]   Well, this is but a pictorial representation of life in this world.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.420]   This is what life does to men.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.820]   And the world is fainting tonight.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.660]   It hasn't got the food.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:08.780]   It hasn't got that nutriment which can build it up and make it strong.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.980]   You see, as the Confession puts it, there is no health in us.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.900]   Are we healthy, my friends?
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.780]   Are we full of vigor and of life?
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.620]   Are you able to stand up to life?
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.620]   Are you conquering?
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   Are you mastering?
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.700]   Are you full of this energy and power that we were meant to have?
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.260]   Man was meant to be God's representative in the world, the Lord of creation.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   Are we like that?
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.940]   No, no, there is no health in us.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:39.220]   We are fainting like these sheep.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:44.420]   And we are attacked by the dogs and the wolves.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.620]   And we lose our chastity, our purity.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.940]   We lose our peace and our quiet.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.980]   We lose our ideals.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.180]   We lose everything that is ennobling.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.620]   And we sink into a cynicism and perhaps into a despair.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.620]   And we say, "What's the use of anything?
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.780]   Or else let us eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die."
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.780]   No health in us.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.940]   Attacked, robbed, despoiled.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:22.460]   And the result is that like these poor, fainting sheep, we are merely existing and not living.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.020]   Have you ever seen sheep in this condition?
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.260]   You wouldn't take them to market, would you?
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.500]   You wouldn't be proud of them.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.780]   You wouldn't take your friends to look at them.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.180]   You'd be ashamed of them.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.020]   You'd try to hide them or to conceal them.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.580]   You don't want anybody to see them.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.580]   Why?
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.060]   Well, because they're not meant to be like that.
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.820]   They're meant to be well fed.
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.820]   They're meant to be full.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:48.260]   They're meant to be strong and vigorous.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.940]   But mankind isn't like that.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.940]   This isn't life.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.220]   This is existence.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:57.020]   And it's a miserable existence, a fainting existence.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.340]   Now here is what this Ethiopian eunuch was reading.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.500]   And the slanderous one was the reader's.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   He doesn't.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.420]   Why should anybody suffer like this?
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:15.300]   Oh, the answer is because of the condition of mankind.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:24.860]   Guilty before God, lost, sick, miserable, unhappy, grief and sorrow, failure, mere existence
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.620]   instead of living.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.380]   That's what mankind has become.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.140]   It was never meant to be like this, but it has become like this.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.500]   That's why the Son of God had to come into this world.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.900]   But wait a moment.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.060]   Even that doesn't complete the picture.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:50.300]   On top of all this, man is perverted and depraved.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.460]   What do I mean by this?
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:54.860]   Well, it's a part of this iniquity.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.620]   He's in an unrighteous state.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.260]   His heart is wrong.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.380]   This is the most terrible thing about men.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.260]   It's bad enough that he should be breaking God's law.
[00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:10.700]   It's bad enough that he should be transgressing, that he should be falling short of the pattern
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.580]   and of the stem.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.100]   But you know, my friends, that's not the most terrible thing about us by nature.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.260]   The most terrible thing about us is this, that even when we're offered salvation, we
[00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.260]   don't take it.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.260]   We resent it.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.260]   We reject it.
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.260]   Listen.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   "Who hath believed our report?"
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.260]   Here's the question.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:40.740]   Here is the report, that this servant of his shall deal prudently, shall be exalted and
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:41.740]   extolled.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:47.140]   Here is the one who's going to sprinkle many nations, and kings shall shut their mouths
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.140]   at him.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.580]   For that which had not been told them, they shall see.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.660]   And that which they had not heard, shall they consider.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.340]   Here is the message.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:04.660]   But who has believed our report?
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.780]   Not ten percent of the people of Great Britain.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.580]   They don't believe it.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:17.020]   Here's the trouble with mankind, and here it is, you see it at its very worst, that
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.700]   man is perverted, that he's become bepraved.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.220]   He's offered a way of salvation.
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.220]   He won't believe it.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.220]   He won't receive it.
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:33.860]   He prefers still to trust to his philosophies, to his own knowledge, his own efforts, his
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:34.860]   own understanding.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.460]   Here is God's proffered way of salvation.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.940]   But who has believed our report?
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.060]   What, says the modern man?
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:48.620]   You don't mean to say that you still believe that old gospel of salvation?
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:53.900]   You still surely don't say that a man's got to believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:58.460]   Son of God, and that it is by dying on the cross on Calvary he saves?
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.540]   What, do you still believe that?
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:06.060]   This is really the best and the funniest joke of all, that anybody in the twentieth century
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.100]   should still be believing this.
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:11.380]   But they've never believed it.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.620]   They didn't believe it in the first century.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.620]   Who has believed our report?
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.420]   It's ridiculed.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:24.180]   But let's go on, the description is still more detailed.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:29.540]   If you really want to know why the Son of God had to die on the cross before you could
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:35.860]   be saved, here's the answer.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:45.220]   If you want to know why this and this alone can save you, here is the answer.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:53.420]   It is the attitude of mankind to the Son of God, who has come into the world to deliver
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.540]   and to save.
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.540]   What is it?
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:01.340]   Well, the first thing is that they didn't recognize him.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.380]   Do you recognize him?
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.740]   Here's the question for you.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.460]   Do you recognize Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God?
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.100]   They didn't recognize him when he came.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.940]   Look at these Pharisees, these doctors of the law, these religious leaders in Israel.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:22.180]   They looked at him and what they said was, "Who is this fellow?
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:26.060]   Who is this carpenter who presumes to teach us?
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.580]   How is this man learning, never having learned?"
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.300]   They didn't recognize him.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.580]   And exactly the same, of course, is true of Greek philosophy.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.660]   You remember how Paul puts it in the first epistle to the Corinthians, second chapter
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:48.860]   in verse eight, "Whom the princes of this world did not know, for had they known him,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:54.060]   they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.180]   Here is God incarnate.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:01.900]   Here is the Lord of glory, standing as a man amongst men, speaking such words as had never
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:07.300]   been heard before, leading a Roman soldier to say, "Never men speak like this man, doing
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   his mighty deeds."
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:15.500]   And yet, they didn't know him.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:22.260]   Here's the condition of mankind, that when confronted by God in the flesh, they don't
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.660]   recognize him.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.380]   But it's even worse than that.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.940]   He is despised.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.700]   They despised him.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:39.500]   You have your faith in men and in men's understanding and in men's discrimination and in men's
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   ability.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.460]   You say, "Oh, man needs his teaching."
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.340]   And you put the teaching before him and he'll rise to it and give him a great example and
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.340]   he'll follow it.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.340]   "My dear friend, it's all happened.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.340]   It's been tried.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.340]   The Son of God has been here."
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.940]   They despised him.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.780]   He was despised.
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.900]   And rejected of men.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:10.220]   Here's the thing you've got to understand and to explain to yourself.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:18.580]   The world chose a robber rather than the Son of God.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:27.540]   Pilate, with a sense of Roman justice and of equity, didn't want to put our Lord to
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   death and his wife had had a dream and she'd warned him.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:38.620]   And he, not knowing exactly what he was doing, he tried to save our Lord from crucifixion.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.580]   But they cried out, "Not this man, but Paratus!
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.860]   This man, Son of God, Savior of the world!
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.860]   Not this man!"
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:52.380]   Despised and rejected of men.
[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:58.260]   And unless you believe in him, you are rejecting him.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.220]   Rejecting his person, rejecting his death upon the cross.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:08.140]   Here is the condition of mankind, here is the problem.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.980]   This is what the world did with him.
[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:15.020]   They ridiculed him, they spat at him, they laughed at him, they jeered at him, they mocked
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   him.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.540]   "Son of God, bearing their sins!"
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.100]   That was their response.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:28.620]   So you see, it brings me to my final point, which is this.
[00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:34.900]   That man is completely helpless to save himself.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:41.180]   The cross proves this.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.540]   People say, "What we want is teaching."
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.180]   I say to you, you've had it.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.580]   The law was the teaching of God.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.740]   You say, "What we want to show is to be shown the pattern, we want to be given the rules.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.180]   Tell us how to live and we'll do it.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.700]   Ten commandments, there they are!"
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.260]   But nobody could keep them.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:12.180]   Again, you see, the Apostle Paul has put it once and forever in Romans 8, verse 3, "What
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:18.100]   the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.140]   There's no use giving us laws we can't keep.
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:26.380]   This is the condemnation, that light is coming to the world, but men love darkness rather
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.380]   than light because their deeds were evil.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.860]   Man knows what he ought to do, but he can't do it.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.020]   The power of sin, "I delight in the law of God after the inward men, but I find another
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:42.980]   law in my members dragging me down, and it's more powerful than I am."
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:47.900]   The tribes, the lusts, the passions, these are the things that make us break the law
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.900]   of God.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.820]   We cannot keep the law of God.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:51:00.940]   Indeed, we know that the very Jews to whom the law of God was given misunderstood it
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.940]   completely.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:07.140]   The Apostle Paul is honest enough to tell us that he misunderstood it himself.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:10.820]   He thought that he was once absolutely perfect as regards the law.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.620]   He said, "I thought that until I saw this little word 'covet' and when I saw the meaning
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.580]   of the word 'covet' I was damned."
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:24.080]   He thought as long as he didn't commit adultery, actually physically that he wasn't an adulterer,
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.620]   but then the word 'covet' came in.
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:31.380]   Any man that looketh on a woman to lust hath already committed adultery in his heart.
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.660]   It isn't enough that you don't murder the man.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:37.460]   If you say, "Thou fool," you've already murdered him in spirit.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:42.820]   The Jews had completely misunderstood the law and they couldn't keep the law.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:47.540]   Man can never be saved by teaching.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.460]   He has been given the opportunity.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:59.180]   He can never be saved by imitating and following an example.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.540]   There is no greater folly in the universe tonight than the whole notion of the imitation
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.060]   of Christ.
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:16.100]   I, who cannot satisfy my own standards, still less the Ten Commandments, talking about imitating
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:23.100]   Christ, sinless, perfect, absolutely holy, he jams me more than anyone I know.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:34.620]   No, no, I can't be saved by law, by instruction, by teaching, by example.
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.100]   My case is too desperate, my condition is too vile.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:48.380]   I'm guilty, I'm lost, I'm perverted, I'm depraved, I'm utterly helpless.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.860]   Is there no hope for me?
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.700]   Oh, yes, there is.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.860]   And this is it.
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:53:03.740]   He, he was wounded for our transgressions.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.780]   He was bruised for our iniquities.
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:17.940]   The chastisement, the punishment which we deserve was put upon him and so we have peace.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:25.100]   My dear friend, it had to happen because of our transgressions, because of our iniquities,
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.380]   because of our utter helplessness and hopelessness.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.380]   We cannot.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:38.820]   He has to come and he has come and he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:46.540]   And this is the glory and the wonder of this way of salvation, that it doesn't ask of me
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:52.660]   to attempt and to say things that are impossible to me.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:54:05.700]   It simply asks me to say this, not the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:09.660]   Could my zeal, no respite, no.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.740]   Could my tears forever flow.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:23.060]   For sin could not atone, thou must save.
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:32.940]   And thou alone, nothing in my hands I bring, simply to thy cross I cling.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.740]   Helpless come to thee for grace, naked look to thee for dress.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:43.380]   How I to the fountain fly.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:50.060]   Crush me, Savior, or I die.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.020]   He had to come.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:55:03.300]   He had to die to bear the guilt and punishment of our sins and he's done it.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.700]   That's what Philip said to the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.820]   The man saw it.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:10.820]   He says, "I believe it.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:12.660]   Can I be baptized into the Eucharist?"
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.660]   And he was baptized.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:20.420]   And he went on his way, rejoicing.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:30.500]   You will remain miserable failure with griefs and sorrows, iniquities and transgressions
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:48.740]   until you likewise believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   And then thou shalt be saved.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   Understand this thou, what thou readest?
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:56:13.980]   Have you seen and understood that it is by dying for you on the cross that he saves you
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.980]   and reconciles you to God?
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:15.980]   Amen.
