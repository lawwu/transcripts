[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Well, how do we pray in the Spirit?
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.960]   And can we accidentally pray out of the Spirit?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   That's a good question from a listener to the podcast named Mary.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.880]   Pastor John, she writes, "Thank you for your lab study through Ephesians."
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   Let's look at the book videos.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.280]   "It has been wonderfully fruitful in my life.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.200]   Keep up the great work.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.120]   My question is whether you can teach me to pray in the Spirit.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.800]   Paul and Jude call us to this.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.640]   So what does this look like?
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.560]   And can you distinguish what it looks like to pray in the Spirit from what it would mean
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.880]   to pray out of the Spirit?"
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.520]   Pastor John, what would you say to Mary?
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.300]   Let's begin by reminding ourselves that prayer is not the only thing that Christians are
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.640]   called upon to do in the Spirit or by the Spirit.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.040]   And just by the way, that phrase "en pneumati" in the Bible, "in the Spirit," is sometimes
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.680]   translated "by the Spirit," sometimes "in the Spirit."
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.800]   I don't think Paul in his mind would make that distinction.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   For example, Galatians 5:16, "Walk in the Spirit."
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240]   Romans 8:13, "Put to death the deeds of the body in the Spirit."
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.560]   1 Corinthians 12:3, "Confess Jesus as Lord in the Spirit."
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.120]   Philippians 3:3, "Worship in the Spirit."
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.360]   1 Corinthians 14:16, "Give thanks in the Spirit."
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.600]   Galatians 6:1, "Restore a wayward brother in the Spirit."
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.360]   So the command in Jude 1:20, "Pray in the Holy Spirit," and it's paralleled in Ephesians 6:18,
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.840]   "Take the sword of the Spirit," which is the Word of God praying at all times in the Spirit.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   These two commands, to pray in the Spirit, are not unique.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.000]   They're part of the whole Christian life, to be lived in the Spirit.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.040]   Everything we do is to be done in or by the Spirit.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:17.200]   I don't think praying in the Spirit refers, by the way, to praying in tongues, in a heavenly language.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   That's what some people think.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.840]   I mention it here, and the reason I don't think that is because Ephesians 6:18 says,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.480]   "Praying at all times in the Spirit."
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440]   And it doesn't mean that you should be praying in tongues all the time.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.680]   This is all of our praying.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.040]   All of our praying is to be in the Spirit, not just one part of our praying, say, praying in tongues.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   So here's my suggestion for what praying in the Spirit means.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:59.300]   It means that our prayers are moved and guided by the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.840]   That is, we are being prompted to pray by the Spirit.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.720]   He's awakening it and moving it.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:16.180]   And the things that we pray for are being shaped and determined by the Spirit.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.360]   So it's His power that carries the prayer, and it's His leading that guides the prayer.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.240]   Now let me point to some passages where I get that idea.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.440]   In Romans 8:26, Paul says, "The Spirit helps our weakness because we don't know how to
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.060]   pray as we should.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.080]   But the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   Now I take that to mean that in some cases, our burdens are so great that we can't find words,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.820]   appropriate words, but we groan toward God.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:06.600]   Our groanings are toward God, and that groaning of our Spirit-filled heart is the very groaning
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.700]   of the Spirit, which God Himself understands.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.700]   So we are being helped by the Spirit to pray.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.740]   And I think we can generalize from that statement and say, "That's what the Spirit does regularly."
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.460]   Not just when we are at a loss for words.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.380]   He is the great helper of our prayers.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.860]   He prompts, He enables, He empowers us in prayer.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:44.340]   And then I think of Romans 8:15, where Paul says, "You have received the Spirit of adoption
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:53.980]   as sons, by which we cry," that is, we pray, "Abba, Father."
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.320]   The Spirit Himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:07.640]   In other words, the Spirit works in our heart to awaken this authentic cry, this authentic prayer,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.760]   "Father, Father."
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.840]   Then everything that we say in that Spirit, in faith that He's our Father, follows as
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.560]   a work of the Spirit.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.840]   I love that text, that my cry to God as my Father is a work of the Spirit.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.160]   I wouldn't be crying as a dependent, helpless child towards God as my Father if the Spirit
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.160]   weren't at work in my life.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.240]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.960]   That's what the witness of the Holy Spirit is.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.520]   And then I add to the prompting and the awakening and sustaining and empowering, all those words
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.040]   for our prayer, I add to that the guiding us to pray as we ought.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   James 4:3 says, "When you ask, you don't receive, because you ask wrongly, with wrong
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.600]   motives, that you may spend it on your passions."
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.760]   Now that would be an example of failing to pray in the Spirit, because the Spirit would
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.520]   never guide you to pray with wrong motives.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   That's not what He does.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.860]   He's a Holy Spirit.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.200]   One of the great functions of the Spirit in prayer is to guard us from praying with bad
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.400]   motives and for wrong things.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:39.760]   Jesus taught us to put "Hallowed be your name" at the front, the priority of our prayers.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.820]   That's what the Holy Spirit is doing repeatedly.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.440]   He is shaping our prayers with right motives, right priorities, with a passion for God's
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.300]   supremacy.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:00.840]   So my understanding of praying in the Spirit is that our prayers are moved and guided by
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.200]   the Spirit.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.480]   That we are praying and what we are praying are owing to the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.840]   So the question is, how do you do that?
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.240]   Which is really part of the larger question of how do you do anything in the Christian
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.880]   life so that it can be said, "Not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.280]   Not I, but the power of the Holy Spirit enabling me."
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.320]   Or Galatians 2:20, "I am crucified with Christ.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:38.460]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ by the Spirit who lives in me and the life I
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.560]   now live in the flesh.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.320]   I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.040]   So the whole Christian life, including prayer, is a great miracle and mystery.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:59.200]   We act the miracle, but the Spirit creates and sustains and guides the miracle.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.340]   And I think that verse, Galatians 2:20, contains the secret of how it's done.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:10.440]   On the one hand, it says, "I don't live, Christ lives in me," or "the Spirit is alive
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.500]   and moving in me."
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:19.920]   Then he turns right around and says, "The life I do live, I live by faith in Christ,"
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.460]   or I would say, "in the working of the Holy Spirit through the work of Christ."
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:32.840]   So my conclusion from that is the way the Spirit of Christ lives through Paul's life
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.200]   is faith in Christ to do just that.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.760]   And here's a confirmation that we're on the right track there when we interpret Galatians
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.460]   2:20 that way.
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:52.040]   In Galatians 3:5, Paul says, "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you," so think supplying
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.520]   the Spirit for your prayers, "Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.240]   among you do so by works of the law, no, or by hearing with faith, yes?"
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:13.720]   In other words, the Spirit of God is supplied to us so we can pray in the Spirit.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.180]   And Paul says that that supply of the Spirit comes by the hearing with faith.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:26.620]   We hear a promise, "I'll help you, I'll strengthen you, I'll hold you up in prayer with my Holy
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.340]   Spirit," and we believe it.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.900]   We believe it.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:38.560]   And by that faith, the Spirit moves to create and sustain and guide our praying.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:47.200]   So my answer to the question is that praying in the flesh would be praying without faith
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.340]   in the promise that the Holy Spirit will prompt and guide our prayers.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:10:00.580]   And praying in the Spirit means we trust the promise of God's help by the Spirit so that
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:09.940]   through this faith, the Holy Spirit is supplied and our prayers are moved and guided by the
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.940]   Spirit.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.940]   What a gift.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.300]   A gift indeed that makes it possible for us to act the miracle.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   Love that phrase.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.380]   And Mary, thanks for the question.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.820]   Thanks for joining us today.

[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:38.100]   Well, next time we're going to look at a theological debate and see why controversy is essential.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.420]   And we will see how theological controversy can be deadly, too.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.860]   It's as deadly as it is necessary.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.060]   Important word to be heeded.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.300]   Next time, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.740]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:51.180]   God bless.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180]   [END]
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:58.180]   1. What is the role of the Holy Spirit in the teaching of the gospel?
