[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.120]   All right, now I'm gonna tell you this story.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.000]   I gotta get out of here.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.920]   And the story is about,
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800]   you guys have probably heard about this before.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200]   It was a young man who, you know,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   he wanted to make a lot of money
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.040]   and so he went to this guru, right?
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.000]   And he told the guru, you know,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.600]   I wanna be on the same level you are.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.480]   And so the guru said,
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   if you wanna be on the same level I'm on,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.840]   I'll meet you tomorrow at the beach at 4 a.m.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.120]   He like, the beach?
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.320]   I said, I wanna make money.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   I don't wanna swim.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.440]   Guru said, if you wanna make money,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.520]   I'll meet you tomorrow, 4 a.m.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.480]   So the young man got there at 4 a.m.,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.920]   he all ready to rock and roll,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.080]   got on the suit, he should've wore shorts.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.720]   The old man grabs his hand and said,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.120]   how bad do you wanna be successful?
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.960]   He said, real bad.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.920]   He said, walk on out in the water.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920]   So he walks out into the water, watch this.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.520]   When he walks out into the water, it goes waist deep.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.640]   So he like, this guy crazy.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800]   Adrian, he like, I wanna make money.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400]   He got me out here swimming.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.400]   I didn't ask to be a lifeguard.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.440]   I wanna make money.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.880]   He got me, so he said, come on a little further.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.840]   Walked out a little further.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.280]   Then he had it right around this area, the shoulder area.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.720]   So this old man crazy.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.960]   He making money, but he crazy.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.120]   Said, come on out a little further.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.200]   Came out a little further, it was right at his mouth.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.920]   My man like, I'm about to go back in here.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.680]   This guy, this is mine.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.880]   So the old man said, I thought you said
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160]   you wanted to be successful.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.000]   He said, I do.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.160]   He said, walk a little further.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.800]   He came, dropped his head in, held him down,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.080]   holding him down, my man getting scratchy,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   holding him down.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.080]   I got you, I know you brushed it out, but I got you.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.440]   He had him held down.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   I need you for illustration.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.560]   He had him held down just before my man
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   was about to pass out, he raised him up.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.040]   He said, I got a question for you.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.720]   Somebody answer the question for me.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.640]   He said, when you were underwater, what did you wanna do?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.760]   Lee, I'm looking for a different word though than lip.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.600]   What's that word?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.960]   He said, I wanted to breathe.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.240]   He told the guy, he said, when you want to succeed
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.460]   as bad as you wanna breathe, then you'll be successful.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.320]   I don't know how many of y'all got asthma in here today,
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.480]   but if you ever had an asthma attack before,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.700]   you short of breath, SOB, shortness of breath,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.280]   you wheezing, the only thing you trying to do
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.920]   is get some air.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   You don't care about no basketball game.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   You don't care what's on TV.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.560]   You don't care about nobody calling you.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080]   You don't care about a party.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.920]   The only thing you care about when you're trying to breathe
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.160]   is to get some fresh air.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.400]   That's it.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.480]   And when you get to the point where all you wanna do
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.280]   is be successful as bad as you wanna breathe,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.960]   then you'll be successful.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.540]   And I'm here to tell you, number one,
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.840]   that most of you say you wanna be successful,
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.160]   but you don't want it bad.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.080]   You just kinda want it.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   You don't want it badder than you wanna party.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.560]   You don't want it as much as you wanna be cool.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   Most of you don't want success as much as you wanna sleep.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.440]   Some of you love sleep more than you love success.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.840]   And I'm here to tell you today,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.800]   if you're going to be successful,
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   you've gotta be willing to give up sleep.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.840]   You gotta be willing to work off
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.440]   for three hours of sleep, two hours.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   If you really wanna be successful,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.480]   some days you're gonna have to stay up three days in a row.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.820]   Because if you go to sleep,
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.700]   you might miss the opportunity to be successful.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.420]   That's how bad you gotta want it.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.240]   You gotta go days without, listen to me,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.080]   you gotta wanna be successful so bad
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.540]   that you forget to eat.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.920]   Beyonce said once she was on the set doing her thing,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.860]   three days had gone by, she forgot she didn't eat.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.940]   'Cause she was engaged.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.880]   I'll never forget when 50 Cent was doing his movie,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.760]   I did a little research on 50,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.640]   and 50 said that when he wasn't doing the movie,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.240]   he was doing the soundtrack.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.560]   And they said, "When do you sleep, 50?"
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   Sleep, he said, "Sleep is for those people who are broke."
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.640]   I don't sleep.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.080]   He said, "I got an opportunity
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.720]   "to make a dream become a reality."
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.760]   Football players, how many football players,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   got anybody like football in here, raise your hand.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.240]   Anybody like football?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.900]   Emmitt Smith, I used to be a Cowboy fan
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.240]   before they did my boy Tom Landry wrong.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.200]   I used to be a Cowboy fan.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.480]   And watch this, there was a commercial.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.800]   Emmitt Smith had won his first Super Bowl,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.640]   and he had this commercial when he was lifting weights.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.760]   I don't know if you saw the commercial,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.800]   and he was lifting, and he said,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   "Emmitt said, you know what, I won the Super Bowl,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.080]   "so I can rest now."
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.960]   He was doing this bench press.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.120]   So he said, "I won the Super Bowl, so I can rest now."
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.000]   So he throws up about 325, boom,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.080]   and he rests for about two seconds.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   Then he, boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.920]   Did you see that?
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.040]   He'd already won a Super Bowl.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.480]   He said, "I think I'm gonna take a rest."
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.720]   And he rests for how long?
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.560]   One second.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.140]   Most of you won't be successful,
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.080]   because when you're studying, and you get tired, you quit.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   And I'm here to tell you today,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.800]   if you gotta, somebody came to my office the other day crying.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.600]   I said, "Look, don't cry to give up.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.940]   "Cry to keep going.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.940]   "Don't cry to quit.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.180]   "You already in pain, you already hurt.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.140]   "Get a reward from it.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.040]   "Don't go to sleep until you succeed."
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.840]   Listen to me, I'm here to tell you today
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.640]   that you can come here, you can jump up,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.400]   you can do flips, you can be excited when we give away money,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   but listen to me, you'll never be successful
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.040]   until I don't have to give you a dime to do what you do.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.760]   (audience murmuring)
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.440]   You won't be successful until you say,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.160]   "I don't need that money, 'cause I got it in here."
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.120]   So listen to me, Emmitt Smith said this
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.440]   at the end of the commercial.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.240]   Emmitt Smith said, "All men are created equal.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.420]   "Some work harder in pre-season."
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.280]   I'm gonna say it again, because you might've missed it.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   All men are created equal, some work harder in pre-season.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.600]   So that means that there are some people
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.840]   who are going to see the professor, going to see the TA,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.520]   and even when the professor says,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.680]   "I don't meet with you, my TA meets with you,"
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.480]   you say, "I don't wanna talk to your TA."
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.160]   - That's what it is.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.080]   - I don't pay the TA. - That's right.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.040]   - I pay you to teach me.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.980]   So you're gonna have to find some time to meet me.
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.040]   If I gotta meet you at the mall,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.600]   if I gotta meet you at your house, you are going to see me.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   Listen to me, all men are created equal,
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.160]   some work harder in pre-season.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.640]   When I went to college, guys were way smarter than me.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.280]   4.0s, 3.0s, they went to the Ivy League high schools,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.440]   came to Oakwood from these great high schools.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.320]   Most of them are not doing what I'm doing, why?
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.800]   'Cause it's not about where you come from, it's about heart.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.520]   You come to a place where being smart ain't enough,
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.460]   you gotta have heart, that's number one.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.640]   Watch number two, number two, catch number two,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.920]   I wrote it down, I wanted to make sure you got it.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.480]   It says, watch this, watch this,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.160]   we're talking about sacrifice now.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.120]   The important thing is this, you're writing
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.480]   why I'm saying it, 'cause I only have
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.160]   about three more minutes, listen to me.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.480]   The most important thing is this,
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   to be able at any moment to sacrifice what you are
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   for what you will become.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.420]   That's the number two thing, you gotta catch that one.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.880]   To be able to, listen to me, at any moment,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.040]   some of you, you can make sacrifices
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.620]   when Monday night football is not on,
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.120]   you can make a sacrifice, but when the game come on,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.680]   for some reason, you just attached to it.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.880]   For some of you, when your favorite show come on,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.360]   you can make sacrifices on Sunday when ain't nothing going on
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.720]   but when your favorite show comes on Monday, bam,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.640]   some of you, you focus into the phone ring
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.040]   and then you like, I gotta answer it.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.240]   If I don't answer the phone, I'm gonna die.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.520]   I'm saying to you today that there are some of you,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.720]   if you give up your cell phone, you would be successful
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.000]   but your cell phone is more important to you
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.260]   than your success.
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:08.920]   I'm gonna say it again, I'm gonna hurt somebody,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.360]   I'm gonna hurt somebody.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.080]   Some of you need to give up your cell phone
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.680]   because the time you spend on your cell phone
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.460]   could be used for your success.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.640]   The time you could be using to be successful,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.040]   you're using it on the cell
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.480]   and the cell phone is not bringing you nothing but a bill
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.000]   and somebody has told you, you couldn't live without it.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.160]   I'm talking about going deep now, giving up stuff.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.480]   Watch what it says.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.720]   To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   for what we could be.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.200]   I don't do well in math, you're right.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.580]   You ain't never studied.
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.680]   I'm not good in writing 'cause you have never written before
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.280]   but I dare you to fail in writing for a whole year
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.360]   to see if you can get to the end.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.600]   I dare you to fail.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.920]   I dare you to take that same class over and over again.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   I dare you to stop dropping classes like you soft.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.600]   Always wanna give up, I'm dropping.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.440]   Why you dropping?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.200]   I'm so grateful that the slaves didn't drop and quit.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.360]   I'm saying I'm just gonna stop.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.360]   I'm a slave, I'm just gonna be a slave, I'm gonna quit.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.080]   Listen to me, the slaves said,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.840]   we will live because one day we will become.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.120]   - Don't just dream about paradise,
