[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue. Duncan, we had a week off, so our inbox is overflowing
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.480]   with questions. Remember, email is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Today's sponsor is Liftoff, our automated
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.920]   platform provided by Betterment. It's kind of an uncertain time these days, right? It
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520]   seems like one week we have stagflation, the next week the economy is too strong, one week
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.340]   we have a hard landing, the next week a soft landing, the years are constantly changing.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.680]   In that context, I don't mind just automating and setting and forgetting. That's kind of
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.840]   what I do with my account at Liftoff. My fund's going automatically, my dividends are reinvested
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.520]   automatically, tax loss harvested automatically. All this stuff happens automatically. I don't
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.160]   have to do it. Emotions are taken out of the equation. If you want to check it out, Liftoff

[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.120]   Duncan, last time we had a show, we looked at some charts, some long-term 10-year rolling
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.900]   returns, 20-year rolling returns, 30-year rolling returns. John, throw up this tweet.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.080]   They've got to be rolling, you know?
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.520]   Yes. Well, yeah, that's a more honest way of looking at it. I put this up, and I did
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.320]   all the different ones, and someone responded, "This was comforting to me in my 30s, not
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.360]   so much anymore looking at the 10 and 20 charts." And I feel like this is a constant back and
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.520]   forth we're having on the show with people with questions. Should I be 100% in stocks?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.080]   Should I hedge a little bit and have more money in cash or bonds or alternatives or
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.120]   whatever it is? And this person was saying, "Hey, when I'm 20 and 30, having all my money
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.980]   in stocks is pretty easy, because the very long term looks pretty darn good. When I'm
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.300]   in my middle age, 40s, 50s or so, maybe 60s, it doesn't look so good, because 10 years
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.520]   you can still have really bad returns." And I think this is the constant push and pull
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.920]   for investors, is thinking through this idea of when to balance and when to take a bunch
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.640]   of risk. And the good thing is that no one has the right answer. Unfortunately or fortunately,
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.920]   there is no good. Some people are fine taking on that 100% equity risk. Some people aren't
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.400]   and need to do more of a glide path. The good thing is that you just have to do what works
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.800]   for you. Also, there are plenty of people out there that will tell you they know the
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   answer. Yes. And that's the thing, is it's circumstantial, and it matters. It not only
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   matters your financial situation, but also your personal makeup. If you know that you
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.680]   simply can't handle taking so much risk, then you have to do what works for you. And if
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.560]   you know that you can, and you're going to be okay with it, then yes. That's the thing
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.400]   I've come to learn, is just do what works for you. All right. Let's get into the questions.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.800]   Right. I always feel really good about risk until things go against me. First up today,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   we have a question from me, actually. I was asking the other day, and we were like, "Let's
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.160]   just do it on the show." I was asking you, "Is it okay to stop contributing to your 401(k)
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   to save up for a down payment?" Yeah. This sounds like a sharp, sharp guy here asking
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.040]   this question. So you were saying, "Listen, I'm looking to buy a house. We're trying to
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.680]   figure out how much we can afford. We're trying to figure out down payment. Is it ever okay?"
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.480]   And I think you also said, "Your wife might get a match regardless, but you, if you stop
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.760]   your 401(k), you don't get the match anymore." Right? Right. I understand the hesitancy here,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.680]   because a lot of these personal finance experts will shame you, because do you know what those
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   contributions could be worth in 30 years if you don't put them on? And it is true that
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.320]   like a match is free money. But it's not like you're turning them off to do Fandu parlays
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.800]   all day. Right? Probably not. You're turning them off for a good reason. Sometimes life
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.720]   gets in the way of the spreadsheets when it comes to financial planning. You just have
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.240]   to divert your savings into other avenues. So the first house we ever bought, it was
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.000]   a split-level ranch. And the upper half of it was finished. The lower level was unfinished.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.880]   And we kind of said, "Hey, this is great. We can grow into it a little bit. And then
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   when the time is right, we can finish out the basement." And it was more expensive than
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.280]   I thought. Now, I will say this. To save some money, my father-in-law knows what he's doing
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.680]   in terms of building and such. So I'd say 50 or 60% of it we did ourselves. I'm not
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.600]   handy at all, so I did what I was told. I held this and moved this. But we framed it,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.080]   and we did some of the stuff ourselves. So we did two bedrooms, a bathroom, put a little
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.320]   bar in, big TV area. But it cost us. And so for probably a period of like, I don't know,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.800]   18 to 24 months, that was our big saving focus. And I didn't completely turn off savings elsewhere,
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.120]   but that was money that could have gone into saving money elsewhere.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.720]   So would it have been nice to have those dollars go into the market? This is probably 10 years
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.420]   later. Yeah, they'd be worth a lot more money, but my 401(k) wouldn't have added 1,900 square
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.920]   feet to our house either. Right? So I think, listen, it's not easy to save for down payment
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.800]   these days, especially in an expensive real estate market like you're in. So I think if
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.960]   you have to go for 6, 12, 18 months, and that's where your personal finance focus is, and
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   you know that afterwards you can turn them back on, what's going to make you happier?
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.960]   Getting your living situation figured out? You've already learned that it's kind of tricky
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.040]   when you're renting, right? Having your own place might make things a little easier. So
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.360]   yes, I bless this decision. If you have to do it, you have to do it. Right?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   Okay. Yeah. And the other part that I was just having trouble figuring out is, so if
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.120]   you have a traditional 401(k) contribution that's before taxes or whatever, then you
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.380]   have to factor in, okay, well, how much is this actually going to end up netting me for
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.300]   a down payment, savings, all that kind of stuff. So yeah, it's a little confusing to
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.360]   figure out. I think if you're doing Roth contributions, I guess it's more straightforward.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.320]   That's a very stressful process too. Buying your first home especially. Buying a home
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   at any time is stressful, but knowing you have that sort of fallback for the down payment
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.720]   and having it be ready, that if you find a place you really love, that you can go ahead
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.680]   and do it, and you already got the letter from the bank saying, "Yes, you're signed
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.080]   off at this level." That's good peace of mind. That money sitting in your 401(k) is
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   not going to give you nearly as much peace of mind as having that down payment sitting
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.280]   there ready to go. Yeah. That makes sense. Cool.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.320]   Also, good luck with the housing search. It's a really easy, as we're going to talk about
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.360]   some questions here, it's not the easiest housing market.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.240]   Yeah. No, it's not looking great, but the good news is we're about to sign. We're getting
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   into another place finally after the flood for all those of you that follow along week
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.320]   to week. We're actually signing another 12-month lease, so it will be probably 12 months anyway.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.640]   I bet you have some time then. All right. Let's do another one.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:27.760]   Up next, we have, "I'm in my mid-40s and have been running my own RRSP, Canadian 401(k)
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.240]   for a while now. I have almost no exposure to bonds, and I ran it by an advisor and her
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.360]   reply was, 'Why would you want bonds?' I could see her panic as bonds had been paying next
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.480]   to nothing for years and didn't appear to offer much protection when stocks dropped.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   Instead of bonds, I've been buying covered call ETFs for what would be the fixed income
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.440]   portion of my portfolio. They pay a nice 6% to 10% distribution, and looking at charts,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   seem to be more secure than even a bond ETF. I'm not expecting to make a massive of capital
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   gains from the value of the individual shares, but using a drip and watching the shares multiply
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.840]   over time seems like a much better play than making almost nothing on a bond ETF. Does
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.800]   this make sense, or have the rate hikes changed things?"
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.240]   Before we get into this one, someone actually in the live comments here said, "How about
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.280]   a 401(k) loan for Duncan?" We're going to get into that in a couple weeks, actually.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.320]   Blair Ducanet is going to come talk about her situation with that. So, put a pin in
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   that one.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.360]   Also, a drip just for our young and new investors watching, that's an automated dividend reinvestment
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.360]   plan.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   Dividend reinvestment plan, right? Yep.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   Okay.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   So, we're going to start off with questions, and the section on investing has been filling
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.400]   up with covered call questions for the better part of a year. There are a ton of investors
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.480]   who swear by this strategy. Jason Zweig at the Wall Street Journal actually just had
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.440]   a piece about this a couple weeks ago, how covered call strategies are just exploding
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.860]   in popularity. And the reason why, because the strategy outperformed last year. And given
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.360]   how it works, it kind of makes sense. So, some people might not understand exactly how
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.240]   these work, so let's do a quick tutorial here.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.720]   So, selling a call option, a call option itself gives the buyer of that option the right to
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.480]   buy at a specified price by a specified date. So, if it hits a certain price by a date,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.720]   you have the right to buy that. To get that option, you have to pay a premium. So, let's
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   look at an example.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.520]   So, let's say you own 50 shares of a stock currently trading for $20. Call options with
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   a strike price of 25 bucks, say, cost 50 cents a piece. So, the person who's selling these
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.440]   options would earn $25 in income on their $1,000 position. That's good enough for you
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.520]   at 2.5%. So, now, though, if you own this stock, your upside is limited to 25%, going
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:39.640]   from $20 to 25, plus that 2.5% option premium. And if the stock goes to 30 or 35 or higher,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.240]   you're over and above 25, you're sort of off the walk, right? You're capped there.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.800]   So, this is a type of strategy that, in a bull market, you assume it's going to underperform.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.320]   The income on the sale of options can help in a hard-charging bull market, but you're
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.520]   likely to miss out on some gains and lag the market, because you're probably going to get
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.040]   taken out on some of those call options. However, in a bear market, this thing should outperform
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.160]   from the option income alone, right? Plus, in a bear market, volatility spikes, and that
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.120]   actually increases some of that income, maybe because it helps with the pricing of options.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.600]   So, essentially, what you're doing with a covered call strategy is you are reducing
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.240]   both upside and downside volatility. And so, many of these covered call strategies also
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.520]   target lower volatile stocks or low volatile sectors. So, that can also help lessen the
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.240]   blow from stock losses. So, I think one of the reasons so many investors are clamoring
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.480]   for these strategies is because last year, they were much less volatile and they outperformed
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.320]   in a bear market. Still, I would not go so far as to call this strategy a bond replacement.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.120]   I think that's a stretch. A lot of people will say the same thing for dividends. I think
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.080]   dividends are a bond replacement. I'm not willing to go that far. I also think it's
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.960]   a stretch to call option income the same as fixed income yield, because it's so much more
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.560]   volatile and the pricing can change on it. You're not locking in a yield. That yield
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.320]   can change. I don't think it's the same thing. These strategies still carry equity risk.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.360]   That risk might be blunted a little bit, but if stocks get crushed, these strategies are
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.720]   going to go down a lot, too. They might not go down as much, but they're still going to
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.680]   get hit. So, I think this strategy can act as a form of diversification, but I don't
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.320]   think it's a bond or cash substitute by any means, especially as far as my risk tolerance
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.040]   is concerned. There's a little fixed income slander here. I want to stick up for bonds
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.640]   a little bit. I know bonds had a dreadful year last year. They got crushed. And I hate
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.240]   the term "perfect storm" when it comes to finance, but last year was basically like
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.380]   a tornado mixed with a hurricane mixed with a tsunami for bonds.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   Like a sharknado.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.240]   There you go. My kids are always talking about, "Is there a tornado with lightning in it or
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.400]   something?" There's some weird thing like that.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   I'm sure, yeah.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:37.560]   I mean, the pandemic drove bond yields to levels that we've never seen before. I think
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.720]   the 10-year got to 37 basis points intraday or something. It was ridiculous. So, that
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.620]   was unstable before we even got to 9% inflation. So, there was absolutely no margin of safety
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.400]   built into bonds. And they rose so fast last year because the Fed went on one of their
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.120]   most aggressive hiking cycles ever. And that's just never happened before.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.040]   So, John, give me a chart of stock and bond returns historically. These are all the years
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.580]   since 1928 that the U.S. stock market has been down. It's happened 26 times by my count.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.600]   And on the right side there is what happened in 10-year treasuries in those same down years.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.800]   So, by my calculations, the average loss for a down year in stocks is a loss of almost
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.640]   14%. The average gain for 10-year treasuries in those years is a gain of a little more
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.960]   than 4%. Now, 21 out of the 26 years bonds have been up. So, that average includes last
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.900]   year's almost 18% massacre in 10-year treasuries. So, the biggest loss in bonds during a down
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.120]   year in stocks before last year was 5%. And that happened in 1969. So, 21 out of 26 years
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.500]   for bonds being up and stocks are down, that's not a perfect batting average, but there's
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.840]   always exceptions to the rule.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.940]   So, I don't think you can just throw bonds out the window because they had one bad year.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.760]   I think last year there was a lot of stuff going on that caused that. Plus, yields could
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.640]   always move higher from here, but we're talking 4-5% in U.S. government bonds now. You can
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.200]   get 5% on a 6- or 12-month T-bill, which basically has zero duration or interest rate risk. And
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.040]   so, I understand people not wanting to be involved when rates are 1%, but that's not
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.320]   the world we live in anymore. Maybe bonds aren't for you, that's fine, depending on
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.800]   your risk tolerance. They're not for everyone. But I just think you have to remember that
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   any sort of income-producing strategy that involves a little bit of equity risk, whether
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.080]   it's dividend stocks or covered call strategies or high-yield bonds, whatever it is, that
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.560]   always, always, always with higher yields comes higher risk. So, I'm not going to try
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.760]   to talk you out of a covered call strategy. I'm not going to try to talk you into it either.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.200]   I just want people to go into it with their eyes wide open and understand how it works
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.440]   before investing in something like this.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.520]   Also, it's probably worth reiterating, but this is something that works much better in
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.280]   a tax-advantaged account because of all those distributions.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.800]   Good call, Duncan. Yes, the taxes and the options, even if it's an ETF, you still get
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.240]   dinged a little bit. So, yes, just know what you're getting yourself into. I'm always weary
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.520]   of bond substitutes because I don't think there really is a substitute for government
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   bonds.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.200]   Right. And they call it secure, but really what they're talking about is low beta, right?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   Yes.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.440]   Which, like you're saying, means that it's capped on the upside some, too, right?
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.840]   The same thing works with defensive stocks or dividend-producing stocks that are in consumer
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.080]   staples or utilities. Those kind of sectors are probably going to outperform in a bear
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   market. They're going to underperform in a bull market. And I think you just have to
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.920]   get used to that kind of thing where you're not getting into it after the bear market
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   already happened and, you know, jumping in and out at the wrong time.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   Cool.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.920]   All right. Let's do another one.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:30.640]   All right. And that question was from Mike, I believe. So, thanks, Mike. Okay. Up next,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.840]   we have, "You mentioned previously that you took out a HELOC during COVID. I'm wondering
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.940]   why you chose that instead of a home equity one. We moved into a new home and we're going
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.360]   to sell it, but I've chosen to rent it out instead. Without having the proceeds from
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.860]   a prior home sale, we are considering either a HELOC or a home equity loan, now that we
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.680]   have equity in two homes."
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   So this is the kind of thing that became very popular during the ultra-low mortgage rate
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.200]   phase of the pandemic. If you hold a 3% mortgage and have the ability to rent out your house
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.480]   and that covers all or most of your needs, why would you give up on a 3% mortgage? I
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.960]   think that's what a lot of people are thinking. Obviously, there's another thing here with
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.240]   being a landlord, but yeah, I kind of get it. Also, side note, I think eventually some
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.400]   bank is going to step in and let you port your 3% mortgage to another loan. I think
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.920]   they're going to have to, to get housing activity back up. I think they're going to tell people,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.200]   "Listen, if you have a 3% mortgage, we'll let you trade it once for a new house. This
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.320]   is going to happen. Someone is going to do this. Fintech people, call me."
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.360]   Listen, homeowners have plenty of equity to deal with these days, so it makes sense people
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.440]   are trying to think about what to do with it. John, the chart we've used before. This
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.480]   is homeowners' equity since the end of 2019, which is essentially the start of the pandemic.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.080]   It's up 50%. It's up to $29 trillion or something. You'd probably take off, I don't know, $1
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.560]   or $2 trillion now, based on maybe where housing prices are now, because this is as of the
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.520]   end of last year. You'd expect it to fall a little bit, but we're talking about a $10
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.600]   trillion increase in home equity. What do you do with it? As Taylor pointed out, I went
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:01.520]   with a HELOC during the pandemic. Here's how it works. I have a 10-year draw period. It
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   works like a line of credit. The bank gave me an amount based on my loan-to-value ratio.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.920]   In that 10-year window, I can draw on that credit as needed. I just have to write a check.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.440]   It's really easy. I can use it as many times as I want. If I use the money, then pay it
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.760]   off and use it again and pay it off in that 10-year window as many times as I want. During
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   this time, the loan is interest-only, so I don't have to pay it on the principal if I
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:24.200]   don't want to. I could just pay the interest after that 10-year draw period is done. Then,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.160]   it essentially converts to a 15-year mortgage with minimum principal and interest payments.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.440]   It's like another mortgage, basically. It's a 25-year period.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.940]   The upside to this approach is it has a ton of flexibility. When I took out my HELOC,
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.000]   we really didn't need it for anything. I just did it because I wanted to use it as a backstop,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.560]   or if I needed to write a big check for some reason, I didn't want to have to shuffle a
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.720]   bunch of other things around. I could just go here and take it out immediately. Since
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.640]   we didn't have any huge projects on the horizon, we thought we might have some in the future.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.760]   I just wanted to have it there. The downside is that the rate is floating.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:57.200]   When I first took out my HELOC, the rate was sub-3% in 2020. Now, it's over 7%. I think
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.360]   it's 7.25%. The good news is you can use that. If you use it for home renovations, you can
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.160]   write off that as tax deductible, the interest. Obviously, looking at the benefit in hindsight,
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.040]   a home equity loan or refinance cash out would have been better if I just put that money
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.800]   in cash and let it sit in T-bills. I'm a process guy, not an outcomes guy. I didn't know interest
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.320]   rates were going to do that at the time. The problem with that, if you took out a home
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.000]   equity loan against your house's collateral or cash out refinance, is that that's a loan
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.720]   you have to pay back immediately. I didn't want to have monthly payments unless I knew
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.640]   I was going to do something with it. There's not as much flexibility there. You kind of
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.200]   have to ask yourself two questions. When do I need this money? Do I need it right now
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.960]   or can it wait? Then, are you willing to lock in a 7% rate right now with a home equity
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   loan, or do you want to roll the dice with the HELOC and maybe those rates fall and come
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.320]   back down to earth? They are variable. They'll move. It's kind of prime plus something, basically.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.400]   I think liquidity needs probably matter most. Do you need this money for something? Do you
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   need it for a down payment to cover some cash since you now have two houses you're sitting
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.840]   on? Anyway, like all personal finance decisions, do what works for you. Whether that's borrowing
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.760]   money at 7% if you need the money now and make the payments, or taking out a HELOC
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.000]   and seeing what happens. For what it's worth, HELOC sounds cooler to
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.120]   tell people about. Home equity line of credit, right? Yeah. Not bad. All right, let's do
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.920]   another one. That one was from Taylor. Up next, we have
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:29.920]   a question from Jimmy. This is a two-parter, so hang in there. With interest rates rising
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.400]   quickly, I know it makes sense for housing prices to stagnate or fall in the short and
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   probably medium term. However, this still makes me think that in the long run, housing
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.040]   will keep getting more and more expensive. I find it hard to imagine in 5 to 10 years,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.360]   rates will be as high as they are whenever the Fed raises rates to the peak. Assuming
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.400]   there continues to be a shortage of housing, as soon as there is any sort of combined or
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.960]   continued rate cutting, prices would skyrocket. It may never go down to 2% again, but even
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.000]   a 4 to 5% rate would likely see a huge increase in prices if rates keep climbing.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.320]   Page two. My fiance and I bought a house in December of 2021, so I'm biased to try and
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.360]   look at the positive side since we didn't get the COVID equity bump. We also plan on
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.200]   staying in this house for 5 to 10 years, so we aren't overly stressed about what our house
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.000]   is worth right now. But I feel like housing is in a weird spot where if interest rates
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.680]   go up and no one can afford a house, supply won't increase. But if interest rates go down,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.960]   there will be a lot of demand, so prices will go up. Curious to hear your thoughts.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.260]   All right. I love talking about the housing market, so let's bring on one of the very
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.000]   first people I ever read blogging about the housing market. This is pre-2008 crisis. Mr.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   Barry Ritholtz. The blog father himself.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.060]   Barry, I was at your house this summer. Before we get into this question, you did a lot of
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.680]   work too. Did you do the HELOC or home equity line of credit?
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.240]   It's funny you said that. We bought a house that was a wreck, and it was the only way
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   we could afford it because we knew how much work it needed. We set up a HELOC. If you
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:06.120]   go back to the '08, '09 crisis, people really abused both home equities and HELOCs. When
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:13.320]   we set up a $300,000 HELOC, we said, "We're only going to use it for home repairs. It's
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.000]   a flat roof, not cheap to repair. Take out 50 grand, put in a new roof, pay it down,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.960]   do the next project." Year after year, we've been doing project after project. It just
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.080]   gives you a lot of flexibility. The risk with the HELOC, as so many people see, they use
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:36.280]   it to subsidize their lifestyle, and that's where people get into a lot of trouble.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.360]   Right. Yeah. You want to use it for a big project. You don't want to just go on vacations
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.920]   with it and then be forced to pay back the rate spikes.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:49.800]   Right, which is what people did in the 2000s. Rather than admit that their salaries weren't
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.200]   keeping up with inflation, that their standard of living was dropping, they just tapped into
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.600]   that equity. For a lot of people, their home is going to be their most valuable holding.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.440]   As that grows, when you retire, you get the benefit of all that built-in inflation. You
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.600]   cash out and sail off into the sunset, not if you keep tapping that home equity.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.760]   Right. I want to ask you about the current housing market. John, throw out my tweet from
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.400]   this week. I basically said, "The economy gets really strong, mortgage rates go up,"
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.640]   which is kind of what we've seen for the last three or four weeks, and then no one wants
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:27.260]   to sell. You see mortgage purchase applications just fall to the floor. The economy gets weaker,
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.120]   mortgage rates might go down, but then demand comes back, and more people want to buy. So,
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.880]   I said it kind of feels like we're in a no-win situation for prospective homebuyers. Duncan,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.680]   cover your ears. This isn't an earmuff situation for you. Unless prices come down substantially.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.360]   Well obviously, we're not going to be in this situation forever, but how do you see this?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.760]   I think the point of the emailer's question here is basically, we just didn't build enough
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.960]   homes, so the supply issue is going to constantly cause problems. I don't necessarily think
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.480]   that means that prices have to continue rising, but I think it probably, I don't know, puts
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.600]   a floor where people want to see housing prices crash 30%. I think the floor is probably there
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.440]   because so many people want to buy houses.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.880]   Yeah, no doubt about it. First, when we talk about houses, recognize it's so variable.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.360]   People tend to talk about real estate as if it's all the same. Geography makes a difference.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.640]   The type of house, is it a starter house, is it a move-up house? Makes a big difference
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.840]   that the price range, the million dollars and up, and the $5 million and up are their
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   own animals. Rates make a difference. If you look at new home starts, I like to use FRED
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.400]   as my data source. If you look at the new home starts, they really cranked up since
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:47.520]   the lows in '09. We were way, way below average. We probably under-built two years.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:54.480]   Hang on, John, throw my chart up here. I did houses built by decade, and this goes back
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.980]   to the '70s. You can see that huge drop in the 2010s when all the builders got scared
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:04.680]   after the last housing boom and bust. I just get the feeling that the home builders are
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.920]   just not incentivized to build right now. They build these, you talked about maybe some
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.560]   higher priced homes, and the people on the lower end are out of luck.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.600]   They also pivoted to multifamily homes during the 2010s. There's a huge apartment shortage
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:29.520]   in lots of cities. I think you now have more housing starts. The peak was 1.8 million around
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:36.840]   spring of last year, which is still way above anywhere in the 2010s. Even now, we're probably
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:44.440]   running about a million and a half rate, which would put us at the peak of the last decade.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:51.160]   That said, rates matter, but they're not the only factor that matter. Now, the US is 330
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.320]   million people. Go back to the '90s, we were 290 million people. There are more people
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:03.080]   looking for houses. Following the financial crisis, track household formation, how often
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:07.280]   people get married, move in together. That really plummeted. People were living in their
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.200]   basements. They weren't forming families. That, during the pandemic, picked up.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:20.520]   Suddenly, we went from too many houses to not enough houses. All that said, everything
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:28.480]   is always specific. I've looked at some houses online. We all go Zillow surfing. You could
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.840]   look at the price history, and I'm genuinely shocked that someone buys a house for $800,000
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:40.920]   in 2015, and then flips it for $900,000, and then someone buys it and puts a few hundred
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:48.680]   thousand dollars in it, and has $3 million. The HDTV home flipper stuff, I don't know
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:57.440]   if that's going to happen anymore. Ben, you did a great piece on 75% of mortgage holders
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:03.280]   have rates at 4% or less. Not only is that stimulative to the economy because they're
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.000]   not spending money, they're just not going anywhere.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.100]   Lewis: Right. I think your point about it being circumstantial is really helpful. Unless
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:18.080]   you get a 2008 scenario where most housing prices fall, you're right, it's going to depend
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.200]   on your neighborhood, where you're located, or the price point you're at. National housing
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.160]   prices for most people are not going to matter. It's going to matter what's going on in your
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.600]   local region. If you're buying houses or flipping them, or just trying to make some money on
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:34.560]   your own house, it's going to be very specific to where you live. Unfortunately, the Case
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.920]   Shiller Index is probably not going to matter to you, personally.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:46.720]   Yup. When you look around at how things are going, we're in the midst of a, maybe once
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:54.480]   in a generation, rejiggering of where people are going to work and live. If you don't have
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.520]   to be in the office, if you don't need to be near a big city center, what does that
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:07.280]   mean? New York saw a population drop like a few hundred thousand, California, three
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:14.160]   or 400,000, Texas increased, Florida increased, and a lot of inland cities are seeing increases.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:22.200]   If you're no longer tied to New York, D.C., Boston, San Francisco, L.A., it frees people
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:30.640]   up. I think you're going to see prices find a new level as the country moves around and
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.680]   finds new places to live. Hey, if I could be someplace warmer where the taxes are lower,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.440]   maybe it's worth selling a house and going elsewhere. I think we're seeing some of that.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.600]   A lot of people don't want to stay where their family is, and they may not want to pick up
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.920]   and move a thousand miles away, but it's definitely shifting in a pretty substantial way. I think
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.640]   of it as a giant reset that's taking place. Please do not tell everyone how affordable
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.880]   it still is in the Midwest here, because traffic is fine here. I never have to wait in traffic.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   I never get stuck. It's fine. No one come here. Actually, I saw Grand Rapids on a list
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:09.320]   of best places to live. Here's the funny thing. You look at the big cities in Florida that
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   are attracting all these transplants from the Northeast, and their infrastructure already
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   is past capacity. They have traffic issues. They have school issues, even sewage and electrical
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:30.080]   issues. They're just not prepared for the influx. What looks really desirable, actually,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   you may be five years behind in your belief system. You have to go kick some tires and
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.280]   hang with the locals. Disney can't even handle the capacity, which is the main perk of being
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.120]   in Florida. All right. We've got one more question. One thing I was going to share real
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.360]   fast on the housing thing. I told you about this, Ben, recently, but I just want our audience
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.200]   to hear. I saw when I was looking at places recently, a place for $600,000 in the Upper
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.800]   West Side somewhere. I was like, "Wow, that doesn't sound that bad for the Upper West
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:05.200]   Side." The HOA fee was $3,000 something a month. Can you imagine? What do you get for
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.040]   that? I don't know. They take the garbage to the curb from the front. Everyone gets
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.600]   a Bugatti to drive or something. I don't know. Not for $3,000 a month. Sign me up for a Bugatti
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:21.360]   at $3,000 a month. I'm in. Okay. Last but not least. Also, I feel like we have to point
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.200]   out the name that Barry has here. That was auto-generated by this platform that we're
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:33.080]   using and he liked it. I may have to get that website. I kind of dig that. Okay. Yeah. Bartholomew.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.540]   Okay. Last but not least, we have a question from Peter. Some say that U.S. equity valuations
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.520]   are generally driven higher over time by the large, relatively constant stream of increasing
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:48.640]   contributions coming from 401(k) plans. Based on known U.S. population demographics, when
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.360]   does this macro driver switch from a net positive to a net drag because net contributions turn
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.720]   into net withdrawals? What did Josh say about this when he wrote about it? The constant
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.400]   bid or something? The relentless bid. Relentless bid, yeah. So, I think it makes sense that
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.160]   fewer barriers to entry would drive up valuations somewhat. Like, Barry, I'm not trying to age
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.960]   you here, but your first stock was probably purchased over the phone. No, my first stock
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.160]   was E*TRADE, was on E*TRADE. Okay, E*TRADE. So, that's what brought me in. But back in
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   the day, you had to go get on the phone or go to an office and fill out some paperwork
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.920]   and maybe write a check. And now, you can just link your bank to an app and be investing
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.800]   in five minutes. So, if you take those barriers down, I think that that should in some ways
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.840]   help take away the frictions that should help valuations. But do you put much – we get
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.560]   questions about this all the time. Do you put much stock in the idea that baby boomers
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.840]   will eventually have to sell en masse and that will make it more difficult for the stock
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.800]   market going forward? Do you think there's anything to this?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:55.480]   Very very little. First, 401(k)s are one factor out of many. I think the US has about $6 trillion
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.120]   in 401(k)s across six or 700,000 plans, and each plan has multiple employees. So, it's
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.240]   just a little bit of money every month. It's not an incredible amount of money. That's
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:15.760]   number one. Number two, we have a very distorted viewpoint of the average investor versus where
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.020]   all the money is. The vast majority of the assets in the stock market – and again,
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:26.000]   you and I, Ben, have both written about this – the vast majority are in the top 1% and
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   the top 10%.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.200]   I think it's 90% is owned by the top 10%, right? They're not going to have to sell
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.280]   all at once.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.680]   Not only are they not going to have to sell all at once, they're going to not want to
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:42.040]   sell because it's going to generate a giant tax hit. And what's much better to do is
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   you give the appreciated stock to either your grad or your trust or your kids or whoever
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.580]   it is, and so they get a lower cost basis for ownership. There are all sorts of ways
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:59.040]   to do this that minimize the tax burden. Selling highly appreciated stock is probably the least
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.280]   efficient way to transfer wealth.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.560]   And in fact, we've had these conversations with some very wealthy clients about, "Hey,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:13.240]   the most efficient way to give money to philanthropies is to take some of that appreciated stock,
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:21.720]   give it to them. It goes into their foundation and they tap it as they need." So, okay,
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:27.860]   so there's 60 million baby boomers who are retiring. A quarter of them have a substantial
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:35.360]   pile of assets that are below the top 10%. It's not enough money to really move the needle.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.200]   Here, Jon, throw this chart from Goldman Sachs. This is one of my favorite charts. Goldman
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:46.560]   Sachs has this ownership of US equity markets since 1949 or 1945. And it shows that, maybe
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.520]   we don't have the chart, but it shows that back in like the 1940s and 50s, US households
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:56.080]   owned, there you go, 95% of all stocks. Individually, they owned them in a brokerage account or
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.880]   something, right? Now you have ETFs and mutual funds and index funds and pensions and foreign
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.440]   investors and hedge funds and all this other stuff. And obviously a lot of individuals
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.480]   hold their stock through these things, but it's just so much more diverse now than it
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.400]   used to be. And it's not just mom and pop buying AT&T stock and what happens if they
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.900]   all go to sell? Oh no, the market's screwed. It doesn't really work like that anymore.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:24.040]   The market is so much bigger and more professionalized and institutionalized. And you also have millennials
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.480]   stepping in to buy, like millennials kind of match the boomers one for one in terms
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.380]   of there's 70 million of you and 70 million of us, and people are going to be stepping
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.920]   in to sort of buy that, I think. And the other part is, baby boomers living longer means
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.500]   they're going to have to continue to own some stocks.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.660]   Right. That's exactly right. I would love to see that chart from 1945 to today, broken
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:52.700]   up by decile of wealth. And the bottom, forget even bottom half, the bottom 90% are such
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.500]   a tiny chunk of the assets. Now it's expanded over the past century or so, but it's still
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:05.220]   8, 10, 12% of total equity. They're not really moving the needle. The people who are the
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.100]   wealthy people in America, they're not sellers. They're long-term investors.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.460]   Yeah. Robert Shiller did some great work on this in Irrational Exuberance, where he kind
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:18.300]   of said, plus you think the market doesn't know this demographic stuff is happening?
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.900]   This is the most telegraphed thing that you could possibly think of. And it's not like
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.440]   the market is just going to be surprised by it all of a sudden one of these days.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.580]   That's my answer every time someone says, you know, there's the buying season for gold
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.180]   is coming up in India. It's like, yeah, for the past 5,000 years, is it not already? Does
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:41.740]   the market not understand that? Unless you're teasing out something that's extremely novel,
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.500]   it's probably already in the price.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.420]   Right. Exactly. Okay, Barry, any good masters of business guests coming up for you?
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:57.140]   Yeah. So last week was Tim Buckley, CEO of Vanguard. That was a lot of fun. I have coming
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:04.240]   up Cliff Asness of AQR, who's having a fantastic couple of years. He's been defending value
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.940]   investing, which the past decade has been an uphill battle. And wherever they fell behind
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.980]   in the previous decade, they now just leapfrogged. AQR is putting up crazy numbers.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.940]   Cliff is great. He's always good for some quotes.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:24.180]   And always, always fun. This week is David Leighton, CEO of The Partners Group, which
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:30.660]   is the largest publicly listed private equity firm in Europe, which coincidentally is headquartered
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:36.180]   in Colorado. It's kind of interesting that they're a fascinating company and their approach
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:42.140]   to looking at the difference between public and private equity is really intriguing. It's
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.540]   all about valuation. He points out we've switched. Public equities used to be cheap. Private
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:52.260]   equities used to be expensive. Now they see the world as, "Hey, public equities are 18,
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:34:00.460]   20 PE. Private is still 10 to 13." He obviously sees more upside for his side of the street.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.340]   Some really interesting people coming up.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.180]   If you could have anyone alive or dead on Masters of Business, who would you have?
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.780]   My experience has been dead people make for terrible guests. So I would skip all the people
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:17.740]   who are dead. But my white whales are essentially Jim Simons, who I met when I was looking at
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:25.100]   colleges in 1979 or '80. And that's a whole nother story. Druckenmiller and Paul Tudor
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.740]   Jones are the other. And I got to interview Steve Cohen at SALT a couple of years ago,
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:36.620]   but it was a panel interview. And I really want to sit down one-on-one with him, especially
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.740]   since he just bought the Mets. And part of the conversation would absolutely be about
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.740]   baseball.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.700]   Duncan wants you to bring on the CEO of Oatly.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.700]   Of Oatly?
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.700]   Yeah, that'd be interesting.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   Oatmilk.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.700]   I'd be up for that.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:49.700]   All right, there you go.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.700]   All right.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   I want to thank-
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.700]   That is a booming segment of the market, isn't it?
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.700]   I want to thank Barry for coming on again.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.700]   Stock's been hurting.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.940]   Thanks, Duncan. We want to give a big shout out to John, the man behind the scenes, who's
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.420]   doing all our charts live from Belgium today.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.140]   Actually, I told you right, he's in Amsterdam now.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.940]   Amsterdam, okay. John is just a world traveler. Remember, if you have a-
