[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Hello, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. And I just realized something that
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.080]   could be the most bullish data point I've heard all year, all 2022. And that is the
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.520]   Treasury Department announced the Series I savings bond interest rate is going to be
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:28.000]   6.89% issued from November 1st, 2022 to April 30th, 2023. Now, the average person might
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.520]   think, oh, OK, 6.89%. Not bad. OK, maybe it's below the rate of stated inflation at the
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.380]   moment. But 6.8% pretty good. It's like the third highest rate ever. And so the average
[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.280]   person goes to TreasuryDirect.gov and buys up to $10,000 per account. Pretty simple stuff.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.000]   However, as a financial samurai, you think in derivatives. And as a listener of the Financial
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   Samurai podcast and the website, you also see that I think in derivatives. So what does
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.360]   this mean? 6.89% is not bad, but that's down from the 9.62% rate offered since May 2022.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.200]   A 2.73% decline is massive. Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means the government
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.160]   believes or knows inflation has peaked and is heading down. This is the most obvious
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.560]   sign I have ever seen that the government knows inflation has peaked. Given one of the
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.600]   goals of the government is to maximize revenue, right? Think about all the tax dollars and
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.440]   the 70,000 pages tax rules that we've got to go through to figure it out. They want
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.280]   their money and they should probably operate a balanced budget. So the government isn't
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960]   willing to pay a higher interest rate than it has to. So the government is paying this
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   interest rate. It's debt from the government's perspective as they borrow money from us.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.160]   So the government has shown us its cards. As a result, we can make higher expected value
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.360]   bets. Imagine if you're playing poker and you knew everybody's whole cards. You would
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.480]   bet more aggressively preflop on the turn and on the river if you knew what everybody
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.000]   had. Well, we know from the series I bond rate offer what the government believes about
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.600]   inflation. We can now assume the inflation figures coming out on November 10th, 2022,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:34.280]   December 13th, 2022, January 12th, 2023, February 14th, 2023, March 14th, 2023, April 12th,
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:43.360]   and May 10th, 2023 will either be below inflation expectations or have a blended overall inflation
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.040]   rate below expectations. And if that is the case, if inflation comes down quicker than
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   estimated, we should see an increase in risk appetite for stocks, real estate, and other
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.120]   risk assets. Now, of course, nobody knows how well risk assets will perform in the future.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.920]   However, the series I bond new interest rate makes me more confident the worst is over.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.440]   On October 17, 2022, the S&P 500 declined to 3577. It closed that day at that level.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.560]   That's probably the bottom of this latest bear market. Because if inflation comes down,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.160]   interest rates are coming down, the net present value of future cash flows goes up, and the
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.520]   value of companies go up. So tech companies that have gotten crushed, and other companies
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   that have high debt levels will probably do better because they're going to save on their
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.040]   debt interest payments. So how do we make money in the future? Well, the first thing
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.760]   we should do is not sell our risk assets because again, the worst is over. The second thing
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.160]   we should do is probably set up parameters as to where we're willing to buy. Now I'm
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.360]   willing to buy if the S&P 500 gets below 3600 all day long, because I think 3577 is the
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.400]   bottom. So if we're closer to the bottom, then I'll be buying because long term, the
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.080]   S&P 500 goes up and to the right. But now that I have this new news, I think buying
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.240]   below S&P 500 3800 is probably going to be a decent bet over the long term. In terms
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   of real estate, my favorite asset class to build wealth, you want to strategically try
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.520]   and make low ball real estate offers for 10 to 20% off right now. Right now, over the
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.800]   next three months, I would say winter is my favorite time to buy real estate because most
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.960]   people who list during the winter are generally more motivated than those who can just wait
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680]   until spring when the weather is better, people are back and people are more motivated to
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.400]   move. And after people have gotten paid their bonuses and have gotten promoted. So strategically
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.200]   try to make low ball real estate offers during this winter before mortgage rates start coming
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.280]   down by two to 3% by April 2023. That's right, folks, the series I bought interest rate offer
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.200]   is literally telling us mortgage rates will start heading south by April 2023 as well.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:21.280]   Because again, the latest offer is 2.73% lower than the last offer of 9.62%. And as a reader
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.380]   and listener of Financial Samurai, you know that everything is related to the risk free
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.800]   rate of return. All asset prices are priced off the risk free rate of return. And you
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.500]   can consider series I bonds as a risk free rate of return. But unfortunately, you can
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.440]   only invest so much right there's a limit, but it is another indicator. And if the interest
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.600]   rate is going to decline by 2.73%, then mortgage rates will also decline by probably two to
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.060]   3%. So in other words, the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage is about 7%. Right now,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.960]   we could see the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage go down to four to 5% by April 2023.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.440]   And you know what the fun thing about writing on Financial Samurai and doing this podcast
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.560]   is we will find out whether my thesis is right in six months, and we will all rationally
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.040]   invest accordingly. So if you're thinking about selling real estate now, I wouldn't
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   do it. I think you're going to encounter people who are going to try to low ball you smartly
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.420]   they will try to get 10 to 20% off because in six months when inflation interest rates
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.900]   go down, the demand for real estate is going to pick right back up. And the same thing
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.380]   for stocks, I would just hold on to what you have, please review your net worth asset allocation,
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.420]   look at your stock asset allocation, real estate asset allocation, alternatives, all
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.680]   that stuff. And mentally, I want you all to feel better that the worst is probably behind
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.280]   us. Because I know this year has been a grind financially. I've been writing and talking
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:00.680]   about ways to how to better enjoy our lives as it's harder to make money and risk assets.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.220]   But we should feel good knowing that we're not going to revert back to the terrible times
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.300]   of the global financial crisis in 2008 2009 and a little bit of 2010. And I do think the
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.600]   worst is behind us. So I'd love to hear your thoughts through a comment and email, whether
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.560]   you believe inflation has peaked and the worst is behind us. I'm also really curious to see
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.920]   if other financial pundits, journalists, other just other people can connect the dots to
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   make this correlation. Because this is one of the things that I was forced to think about
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.440]   when I worked in finance, how to connect the dots to make better investment decisions.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.120]   And this dot connecting seems to be the most obvious one. But maybe something that's obvious
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.640]   to me is not obvious to everybody else. And maybe this will become actually more obvious
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:58.320]   to more people as time goes on, which in turn would create more appetite for risk assets.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.840]   So if you think I'm totally delusional, or I'm missing something, please also let me
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.520]   know. Having investing in blind spots is just kind of the way of life, but it's also very
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.480]   dangerous. So it's good for all of us to learn together and to share our thoughts and opinions
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.160]   and argue why we believe the way we do. If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a positive
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.760]   review. If you'd like to support my work, my free podcast, my free writing, pick up

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   season, I hope everyone stays safe. I hope everyone bolsters their finances, reviews
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.200]   their finances, talks to their loved ones and their family about their finances. Right
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.920]   now is truly the best time of the year. My family had a wonderful time trick or treating
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.100]   in Noe Valley. It was so great to see the kids just dress up and just be so happy and
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.960]   excited. I remember when I was working, November and December were the best times because business
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.320]   was slow. There were a lot of holidays. People were merry. There were holiday parties. Oh,
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.680]   I'm so envious of folks who have holiday parties because that's one thing I don't have as an
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.520]   unemployed person or as a solopreneur. So let's take this slow time to appreciate more
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.360]   of what we have. And I hope to see everyone around the comment section. Take care.
