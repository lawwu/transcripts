[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   The following is a conversation with Catherine DeCleer,
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.640]   a professor of planetary science and astronomy at Caltech.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.320]   Her research is on the surface environments,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.600]   atmospheres, and thermochemical histories
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.880]   of the planets and moons in our solar system.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.600]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   Fundrise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.760]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.200]   As a side note, let me say that this conversation
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.840]   and a few others, quite big ones actually,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.280]   that are coming up were filmed in a studio
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.980]   where I was trying to outsource some of the work.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.800]   Like all experiments, it was a learning experience for me.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.920]   It had some positives and negatives.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.000]   Ultimately, I decided to return back to doing it
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.040]   the way I was doing before,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.320]   but hopefully with a team who can help me out
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.500]   and work with me long-term.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.320]   The point is I will always keep challenging myself,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.440]   trying stuff out, learning, growing,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.540]   and hopefully improving over time.
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.680]   My goal is to surround myself with people
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.480]   who love what they do, are amazing at it,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.880]   and are obsessed with doing the best work of their lives.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.000]   To me, there's nothing more energizing and fun than that.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.420]   In fact, I'm currently hiring a few folks
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.540]   to work with me on very small projects.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.800]   If this is something of interest to you,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.340]   go to lexfriedman.com/hiring.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580]   That's where I will always post opportunities
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.480]   for working with me.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.640]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.780]   and here is my conversation with Catherine DeCleer.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.020]   Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.300]   Does this upset you, or has justice finally been served?
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.300]   - So I get asked this all the time.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.460]   I think all planetary scientists get asked about Pluto,
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.220]   especially by kids who would just love for Pluto
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.320]   to still be a planet.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.220]   But the reality is when we first discovered Pluto,
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.380]   it was a unique object in the outer solar system,
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.060]   and we thought we were adding a planet
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940]   to the inventory of planets that we had.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.660]   And then over time, it became clear that Pluto
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.740]   was not a unique large object in the outer solar system,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.920]   that there were actually many of these.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.820]   And as we started discovering more and more of them,
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.540]   we realized that the concept of Pluto being a planet
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680]   didn't make sense unless maybe we added
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.900]   all the rest of them as planets.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.260]   So you could have imagined actually a different direction
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.060]   that this could have gone, where all the other objects
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.620]   that were discovered in that belt,
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.980]   or at least all the ones, let's say, above a certain size,
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.160]   became planets instead of Pluto being declassified.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.400]   But we're now aware of many objects out there
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.780]   in the outer solar system, in what's called the Kuiper Belt,
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.740]   that are of the same size, or in some cases,
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.180]   even larger than Pluto.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.740]   So the declassification was really just a realization
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.700]   that it was not in the same category
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.620]   as the other planets in the solar system,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.800]   and we basically needed to refine our definition
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.380]   in such a way that took into account
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.460]   that there's this belt of debris out there
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.020]   in the outer solar system of things with a range of sizes.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.900]   - Is there a hope for clear categorization
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.140]   of what is a planet and not?
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.780]   Or is it all just gray area?
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.860]   When you study planets, when you study moons,
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.620]   satellites of those planets,
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.380]   is there lines that could be cleanly drawn,
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.380]   or is it just a giant mess?
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.940]   Is this all like a fluid, let's say not mess,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.020]   but it's like fluid of what is a planet,
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.620]   what is a moon of a planet, what is debris,
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.460]   what is asteroids, all that kind of?
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.220]   - So there are technically clear definitions
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.260]   that were set down by the IAU,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.820]   the International Astronomy Union.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.900]   - Is it size-related?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.500]   Like what are the parameters based on what?
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.460]   - So the parameters are that it has to orbit the sun,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.740]   which was essentially to rule out satellites.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.700]   Of course, this was a not very forward-thinking definition
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.140]   because it technically means that all extrasolar planets,
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.960]   according to that definition, are not planets.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.300]   So it has to orbit the sun.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.500]   It has to be large enough that its gravity
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.380]   has caused it to become spherical in shape,
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.260]   which also applies to satellites and also applies to Pluto.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.900]   The third part of the definition
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.620]   is the thing that really rules out everything else,
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.420]   which is that it has to have cleared out its orbital path.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.500]   And because Pluto orbits in a belt of material,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.460]   it doesn't satisfy that stipulation.
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.820]   - Why didn't it clear out the path?
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.500]   It's not big enough to knock everybody out of the way?
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.980]   - And this actually is not the first time it has happened.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.980]   So Ceres, when it was discovered,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.140]   Ceres is the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.440]   and it was originally considered a planet
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.680]   when it was first discovered.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.980]   And it went through exactly the same story, history,
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.860]   where people actually realized
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.700]   that it was just one of many asteroids
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.900]   in the asteroid belt region,
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.060]   and then it got declassified to an asteroid,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.100]   and now it's back to a dwarf planet.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.020]   So there is a lot of reclassification.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.540]   So to me, as somebody who studies solar system objects,
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.780]   I just personally don't care.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.220]   My level of interest in something has nothing to do
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.380]   with what it's classified as.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.100]   So my favorite objects in the solar system are all moons,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.900]   and frequently when I talk about them,
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.100]   I refer to them as planets,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.340]   because to me they are planets.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.220]   They have volcanoes, they have geology,
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.020]   they have atmospheres, they're planet-like worlds.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.020]   And so the distinction is not super meaningful to me,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.980]   but it is important just for having a general framework
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.160]   for understanding and talking about things
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.700]   to have a precise definition.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.220]   - So you don't have a special romantic appreciation
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.540]   of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.260]   It's just an object that flies out there,
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.100]   and it doesn't really matter what the categorization is.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.260]   Because there's movies about asteroids and stuff.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.220]   And then there's movies about the moon,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.980]   whatever, it's a really good movie.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.180]   There's something about moons
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.460]   that's almost like an outlier.
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.460]   You think of a moon as a thing that's the secret part,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.380]   and the planet is the more vanilla, regular part.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.220]   None of that?
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.040]   You don't have any of that?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.880]   - No, I actually do.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.460]   Really, satellites, the moons are my favorite things
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.300]   in the solar system.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.340]   And I think part of what you're saying,
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.260]   I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective,
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.480]   which is from the perspective of exploration.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.960]   We've spent a lot of time
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.680]   sending spacecraft missions to planets.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.780]   We had a mission to Jupiter, we had a mission to Saturn.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.560]   We have plenty of missions to Mars and missions to Venus.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.600]   I think the exploration of the moons
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.160]   in the outer solar system is the next frontier
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.300]   of solar system exploration.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.820]   - The belt of debris, just real quick.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.300]   That's out there.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.480]   Is there something incredible to be discovered there?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.340]   Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons,
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.140]   but it feels like there's probably a lot of stuff out there.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.760]   And it probably, what is it?
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.120]   It's like a garbage collector
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.700]   from outside of the solar system, isn't it?
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.140]   Like, doesn't it protect from other objects
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.100]   that kind of fly in?
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.460]   And what, it just feels like it's a cool,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.980]   you know when you like walk along the beach
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.980]   and look for stuff and like look for,
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.180]   it feels like that's that kind of place
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.740]   where you can find cool, weird things.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.820]   Or I guess in our conversation today,
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.460]   when we think about tools and what science is studying,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.380]   is there something to be studied out there?
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.180]   Or we just don't have maybe the tools yet,
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.260]   or there's nothing to be found?
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.300]   - There's absolutely a lot to be found.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.560]   So the material that's out there is remnant material
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.420]   from the formation of our solar system.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.820]   We don't think it comes from outside the solar system,
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.380]   at least not most of it.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.380]   But there are so many fascinating objects out there.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.060]   And I think what you've hit on is exactly right,
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.720]   that we just don't have the tools to study them in detail.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.820]   But we can look out there and we can see
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.220]   there are different species of ice on their surface
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.660]   that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.900]   of the disk that formed our solar system.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.580]   Some of these objects are way brighter than they should be,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.120]   meaning they have some kind of geological activity.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.300]   People have hypothesized that some of these objects
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.940]   have subsurface oceans.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.620]   You could even stretch your imagination
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.360]   and say some of those oceans could be habitable.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.840]   But we can't get very detailed information about them
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   because they're so far away.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.300]   And so I think if any of those objects
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.520]   were in the inner solar system,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.940]   it would be studied intently and would be very interesting.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.820]   - So would you be able to design a probe
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.840]   in that like very dense debris field,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.700]   be able to like hop from one place to another?
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.060]   Is that just outside of the realm of,
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.420]   like how would you even design devices
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.180]   or sensors that go out there and take pictures and land?
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.580]   Do you have to land to truly understand
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.460]   a little piece of rock?
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.220]   Or can you understand it from remotely,
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.320]   like fly up close and remotely observe?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.260]   - You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.060]   and that's all we're currently capable of doing
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.540]   in the outer solar system.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.900]   The New Horizons mission is a recent example
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.060]   which flew by Pluto.
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.540]   And then they had searched for another object
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.900]   that was out there in the Kuiper belt,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.540]   any object that was basically somewhere
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.860]   that they could deflect their trajectory to actually fly by.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.180]   And so they did fly by another object
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.620]   out there in the Kuiper belt and they take pictures
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.620]   and they do what they can do.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.660]   And if you've seen the images from that mission of Pluto,
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.780]   you can see just how much detail we have
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.820]   compared to just the sort of reddish dot
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.620]   that we knew of before.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.460]   So you do get an amazing amount of information actually
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.380]   from just essentially a high-speed flyby.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.020]   - It always makes me sad to think about flybys
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.620]   that we might be able to,
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.940]   we might fly by a piece of rock, take a picture
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.980]   and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and whatever.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.180]   And that you could study certain like composition
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.700]   of the surface and so on.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.180]   But it's actually teeming with life
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.620]   and we won't be able to see it at first.
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.620]   And it's sad 'cause you know,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.900]   like when you're on a deserted island,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.140]   you wave your hands and the thing flies by
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.420]   and you're trying to get their attention
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.500]   and they probably do the same, well, in their own way.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.780]   Bacteria probably, right?
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.260]   But, and we miss it.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260]   I don't know, some reason it makes me,
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.040]   it's the FOMO, it's fear of missing out.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.900]   It makes me sad that there might be life out there
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.500]   and we don't, we're not in touch with it.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.440]   We're not talking.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.180]   Well, okay.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.460]   A sad pause, Russian philosophical pause.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.700]   Okay, what are the tools available to us
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.700]   to study planets and their moons?
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.400]   Oh my goodness, that is such a big question.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.260]   So among the fields of astronomy,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.500]   so planetary science broadly speaking,
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.380]   well, it falls kind of at the border of astronomy,
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.840]   geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.500]   So it's kind of on the border of many things,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.460]   but part of it falls under the heading of astronomy.
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.420]   And among the things that you can study with telescopes,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.580]   like solar system moons and planets,
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.180]   the solar system is really unique
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.460]   in that we can actually send spacecraft missions
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.540]   to the objects and study them in detail.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.300]   And so I think that's the kind of type of tool
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.140]   that people are most aware of,
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.660]   that's most popularized, these amazing NASA missions
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.500]   that either you fly by the object, you orbit the object,
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.740]   you land on the object,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.140]   potentially you can talk about digging into it,
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.140]   drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.900]   The types of tools that I use are primarily telescopes.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.300]   And so my background is in astrophysics.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.560]   And so I actually got into solar system science
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.380]   from astronomy, not from a childhood fascination
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.340]   with spacecraft missions,
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.380]   which is actually what a lot of planetary scientists
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.660]   became planetary scientists
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.320]   because of childhood fascination with spacecraft missions,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.500]   which is kind of interesting for me to talk to people
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   and see that trajectory.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.380]   I kind of came at it from the fascination
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.700]   with telescopes angle.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.340]   - So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least you--
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.280]   - When I was a kid, it was looking at the stars
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.680]   and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.020]   And that's how I got into this.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.900]   But telescopes, it's amazing how much detail
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.640]   and how much information you can get from telescopes today.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   You can resolve individual cloud features
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.060]   and watch them kind of sheer out
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.620]   in the atmosphere of Titan.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.540]   You can literally watch volcanoes on Io change
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.380]   from day to day as the lava flows expand.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.320]   So, and then, you know, with spectroscopy,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.600]   you get compositional information on all these things.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   And it's, when I started doing solar system astronomy,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.180]   I was surprised by how much detail
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.220]   and how much information you can get even from Earth.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.820]   And then, as well as from orbit,
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.320]   like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.380]   - So with a telescope, you can, I mean,
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.420]   how much information can you get about volcanoes,
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.020]   about storms, about sort of weather,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.760]   just so we kind of get a sense,
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.340]   like what a resolution we're talking about?
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.500]   - Well, in terms of resolution, so at a, you know,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.920]   on a given night, if I go and take a picture of Io
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.180]   and its volcanoes, you can sometimes see
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.420]   at least a dozen different volcanoes.
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.400]   You can see the infrared emission coming off of them
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.460]   and resolve them, separate them from one another
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.220]   on the surface and actually watch how the heat coming off
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.420]   of them changes with time.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.380]   And I think this time variability aspect
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.740]   is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.740]   So you send a spacecraft mission there
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.980]   and you get an incredible amount of information
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.540]   over a very short time period.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.460]   But for some science questions,
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.440]   you need to observe something for 30 years, 40 years.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.120]   Like let's say you want to look at the moon Titan,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.660]   which has one of the most interesting atmospheres
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.360]   in the solar system.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   Its orbital period is 29, 30 years.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.080]   And so if you want to look at how
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.720]   its atmospheric seasons work,
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.200]   you have to observe it over that long of a time period.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.240]   And you're not going to do that with a spacecraft,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.360]   but you can do it with telescopes.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.540]   - Can we just zoom in on certain things?
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.740]   Like let's talk about Io, which is the moon of Jupiter.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.580]   - Right.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.920]   - Okay, it's like epic.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.200]   There's like volcanoes all over the place.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.960]   It's from a distance, it's awesome.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.000]   So can you tell me about this moon
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.600]   and you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.080]   but that one kind of stood out to me.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.280]   So why is that an interesting one?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.600]   - For so many reasons,
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.920]   but Io is the most volcanically active object
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.760]   in the solar system.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.440]   It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.520]   It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.040]   up above its surface.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.600]   It puts out more volume of magma per volcano
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.040]   than volcanoes on earth today.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.360]   But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   is as a laboratory for understanding planetary processes.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.720]   So one of the broad goals of planetary science
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.840]   is to put together a sort of more general
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   and coherent framework for how planets work in general.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.640]   Our current framework, it started out very earth centric.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.480]   We start to understand how earth volcanoes work.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.520]   But then when you try to transport that
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.120]   to somewhere like Io that doesn't have an atmosphere,
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.820]   which makes it has a very tenuous atmosphere,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.480]   which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.800]   For something that's really small,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.600]   for something that has a different heat source,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.640]   for something that's embedded in another object's
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.460]   magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from earth
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.300]   doesn't apply.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.060]   And so broadly, planetary sciences is trying to broaden
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.640]   that framework so that you have a kind of narrative
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.000]   that all you can understand how each planet
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.440]   became different from every other planet.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.040]   And I'm already making a mistake.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.240]   When I say planet, I mean planets and moons.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.280]   Like I said, I see the moons as planets.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.360]   - As planets.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.320]   Yeah, I actually already noticed that you didn't introduce
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.520]   Io as the moon of Jupiter.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.320]   You completely, you kind of ignored the fact
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.400]   that Jupiter exists.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.000]   It's like, let's focus on the...
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.560]   Yeah, okay, so and you also didn't mention Europa,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   which I think is the,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.720]   is that the most famous moon of Jupiter?
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.360]   Is that the one that gets attention
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.320]   'cause it might have life?
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.720]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.760]   - But to you, Io is also beautiful.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.240]   What's the difference between volcanoes on Io versus earth?
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.680]   You said atmosphere makes a difference.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.240]   What-- - Yeah.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.440]   The heat source plays a big role.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.140]   So many of the moons in the outer solar system
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.440]   are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.640]   And I'm happy to describe what that is or not.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.680]   - Well, yeah, please, what's tidal?
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.000]   Yes, yes, please. - So tidal heating is,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.740]   if you wanna understand and contextualize planets and moons,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.520]   you have to understand their heat sources.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.080]   So for earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.320]   as well as residual heat of formation.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   But for satellites,
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.560]   tidal heating plays a really significant role,
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.500]   and in particular,
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.160]   in driving geological activity on satellites
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.480]   and potentially making those subsurface oceans
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.640]   in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.920]   And so the way that that works is
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.640]   if you have multiple moons
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.280]   and their orbital periods
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.520]   are integer multiples of one another,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.560]   that means that they're always encountering each other
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.060]   at the same point in the orbit.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.360]   So if they were on just random orbits,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.320]   they'd be encountering each other at random places,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.680]   and the gravitational effect between the two moons
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.920]   would be canceling out over time.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.780]   But because they're always meeting each other
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.120]   at the same point in the orbit,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.320]   those gravitational interactions add up coherently.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.640]   And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.920]   - What's an eccentric orbit?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.440]   - So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit,
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.020]   it just means non-circular,
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.880]   so a deviation from a circular orbit.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.800]   And that means that for Io or Europa,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.200]   at some points in their orbit,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.400]   they're closer to Jupiter,
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.240]   and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.280]   And so when they're closer,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.840]   they're stretched out in a sense,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.300]   but literally just not very stretched out,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.000]   like a couple hundred meters, something like that.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And then when they're farthest away,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.200]   they're less stretched out.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.040]   And so you actually have the shape of the object
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.080]   deforming over the course of the orbit.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.320]   And these orbits are like just a couple of days.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.600]   And so that, in the case of Io,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.760]   that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.720]   to melt the rock of its mantle.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.600]   And that's what generates the magma.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.200]   - That's the source of the magma.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.160]   Okay, so why is, so Europa is,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.920]   I thought there was like ice
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.080]   and oceans underneath kind of thing.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.240]   So why is Europa not getting the friction?
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.720]   - It is, it's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.680]   And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.040]   So it's a three object orbital resonance
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.680]   in the Jupiter system.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.220]   But we have these sorts of orbital resonances
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.600]   all over the solar system and also in exoplanets.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.040]   So for Europa, basically because it's farther from Jupiter,
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.560]   the effect is not as extreme,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.800]   but you do still have heat generated in its interior
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.480]   in this way, and that may be driving,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.400]   could be driving hydrothermal activity
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.880]   at the base of its ocean,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.600]   which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.880]   - Cool, so it's like heating up the ocean a little bit.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.280]   - Heating up the ocean a little bit.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.240]   And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.320]   where we see really interesting life evolve
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.160]   in the bottom of Earth's oceans.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.080]   - That's cool, okay.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.440]   So what's Io, what else?
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.060]   So we know the source is this friction,
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.840]   but there's no atmosphere.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.400]   I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.200]   if you and I were to visit Io.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.480]   What would that look like?
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.680]   What would it feel like?
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.720]   Is this the entire thing covered in basically volcanoes?
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.640]   - So it's interesting because there's very little atmosphere.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.920]   The surface is actually really cold,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.960]   very far below freezing on the surface
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.320]   when you're away from a volcano,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.800]   but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   or the magma when it comes out is over a thousand degrees.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.800]   So--
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.760]   - But it does come to the surface, the magma?
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.680]   - It does, yeah.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   - In particular places.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.040]   Whoa, that probably looks beautiful.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.400]   So like, so it's frozen, not ice.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.560]   Like what is rock?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.260]   It's really cold rock.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.440]   And then you just have this like,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.360]   what would that look like with no atmosphere?
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.820]   Would that, would it be smoke?
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.520]   What does it look like?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.280]   Is just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.480]   - It's black, it's black and red, I guess.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.360]   Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.640]   So different types of magma flow in different ways,
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.320]   for example, so in somewhere like Io,
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.640]   the magma is really hot.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.120]   And so it will flow out in sheets
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.720]   because it has really low viscosity.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.760]   And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.720]   over the past couple of years
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.200]   are probably a decent analogy,
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.840]   although Io's magmas, lavas are even more fluid
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   and faster moving.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.920]   - How fast, like what, how fast, like if you,
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   by the way, sorry, through the telescope,
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.560]   are you tracking at what time scale?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.520]   Like every frame is how far apart
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.160]   if you're looking through a telescope?
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.480]   Are we talking about seconds?
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.320]   Are we talking about days, months?
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.840]   When you kind of track,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.680]   try to get a picture of what the surface might look like.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.520]   What's the frequency?
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.400]   - So it depends a little bit on what you want to do.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.320]   I, ideally every night,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.640]   but you could take a frame every second
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.400]   and see how things are changing.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.240]   The problem with that is that for things to change
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   on a one second time scale,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.920]   you to actually see something change that fast,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.720]   you have to have super high resolution.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.640]   The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.840]   kilometers and so things are not changing
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.400]   on those scales over one second,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.640]   unless you have something really crazy happening.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.200]   - So if you get a telescope closer to Io,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.240]   if you get a, or a camera closer to Io,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.800]   would you be able to understand something,
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.680]   is that something of interest to you?
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.360]   Would you be able to understand something deeper
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.760]   about these volcanic eruptions and how magma flows
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.480]   and just the, like the rate of the magma,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.000]   or is it basically enough to have the kilometer resolution?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.120]   Do you get a sense? - No way.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.520]   We wanna go there.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.200]   - You wanna go to Io?
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.720]   - I mean, I don't wanna go there personally,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.040]   but I wanna send a spacecraft mission there, absolutely.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.920]   - Why, why are you scared?
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:05.880]   - Why am I scared?
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.120]   - Oh, you mean you don't,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.240]   (laughing)
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.640]   Oh, like human.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.920]   - I don't wanna go there as a human.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.760]   - As a human.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.520]   - I wanna send a robot there to look at it though.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.080]   - This is again, everybody's discriminating against robots.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.600]   This is not, but it's fine.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.040]   But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.640]   So it's very cold and very hot.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.000]   - It's very cold.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.040]   The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.560]   So you can breathe it.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.600]   There's no pressure.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.680]   I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.600]   One talks about Mars only worse.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.880]   The atmosphere is still a thousand times less dense
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   than Mars is.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   And the radiation environment is terrible
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.320]   because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's magnetic field
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.240]   and Jupiter's magnetic field is full of charged particles
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.280]   that have all come out of Io's volcanoes actually.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.960]   So Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   out of Io's atmosphere.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.440]   And that populates its entire magnetosphere.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.840]   And then that material comes back around and hits Io
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.760]   and spreads throughout the system actually.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.920]   It's just, it's like Io is the massive polluter
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.120]   of the Jupiter system.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.600]   - Okay, cool.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   So what is studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.160]   or vice versa?
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.680]   Is in the difference of the two,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.480]   what insights can you mine out
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.680]   that might be interesting in some way?
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.960]   - Yeah, it's, we try to port the tools
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.160]   that we use to study earth volcanism to Io
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.400]   and it works to some extent, but it is challenging
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.360]   because the situations are so different
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.880]   and the compositions are really different
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.800]   when you talk about outgassing,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.400]   earth volcanoes outgas primarily water and carbon dioxide
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.000]   and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.960]   Either it didn't form with them or it lost them.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.800]   We don't know.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.120]   And so the chemistry of how the magma outgasses
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.040]   is completely different.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.800]   But the kind of one to me,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.960]   most interesting analogy to earth is that,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.600]   so Io, as I've said,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.840]   it has these really low viscosity magmas.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.120]   The lava spreads really quickly across its surface.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.600]   It can put out massive volumes of magma
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.280]   in relatively short periods of time.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.400]   And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.000]   in the solar system today,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.200]   but literally every terrestrial planet and the moon
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.600]   had this, what we call very effusive volcanism
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.720]   early in their history.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.680]   - Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.960]   into the early history of earth.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.800]   - Yeah.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.620]   - Okay, cool.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.840]   So what are the chances that a volcano on earth
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.680]   destroys all of human civilization?
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.760]   Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.460]   - Yeah, a volcano on earth.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:07.240]   - Do you think about that kind of stuff
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.560]   when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.800]   'Cause isn't it kind of humbling
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.080]   to see something so powerful and so hot,
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.440]   like so unpleasant for humans
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.680]   and then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.080]   - Right, yeah, Yellowstone as a classic example.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.680]   I don't know what the chances are of that happening.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.920]   My intuition would be that the chances of that
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.080]   are lower than the chances of us getting wiped out
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.440]   by some other means.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.200]   That in the time, that maybe it'll happen eventually,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.160]   that there'll be one of these massive volcanoes on earth,
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.080]   but we'll probably be gone by then by some other means.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.480]   Not to sound bleak, but.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.400]   (both laughing)
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.600]   - That's very comforting.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.260]   Okay, so can we talk about Europa?
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:55.920]   Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition,
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.840]   the hope that people have about life being on Europa?
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.560]   Maybe also what are the things we know about it?
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.320]   What are the things to you that are interesting
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.440]   about that particular moon of Jupiter?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.480]   - Sure, yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.640]   one of the really interesting places in the solar system,
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.880]   among the solar system moons.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.560]   So there are a few, there's a lot of interest
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.280]   in looking for or understanding the potential
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.720]   for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.160]   I think it's fairly widely accepted
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.000]   that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.520]   of really anything in the solar system is very low.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.320]   The radiation environment is too harsh,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.360]   and there's just not liquids on the surface
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.160]   of most of these things, and it's canonically accepted
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.080]   that liquids are required for life.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.280]   And so the subsurface oceans,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.080]   in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere,
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.920]   the subsurface oceans of the icy satellites
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.560]   are one of the most plausible places
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.320]   in the solar system for life to evolve.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.480]   Europa and Celadus are interesting
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.520]   because for many of the big satellites,
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.040]   so Ganymede and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.440]   also are thought to have subsurface oceans.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.280]   But they are, so they have these ice shells,
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.280]   and then there's an ocean underneath the ice shell.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.200]   But on those moons, or on Ganymede,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.560]   we think that there's another ice shell underneath,
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.200]   and then there's rock.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.800]   And the reason that that is a problem for life
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.000]   is that your ocean is probably just pure water
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.640]   because it's trapped between two big shells of ice.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.000]   So Europa doesn't have this ice shell
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.680]   at the bottom of the ocean, we think.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.800]   And so the water and rock are in direct interaction,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.560]   and so that means that you can basically dissolve
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.000]   a lot of material out of the rock.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.160]   You potentially have this hydrothermal activity
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.800]   that's injecting energy and nutrients for life to survive.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.160]   And so this rock-water interface
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.480]   is considered really important
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.720]   for the potential habitability.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.560]   - As a small aside, you kind of said
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.120]   that it's canonically assumed
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.520]   that water is required for life.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.880]   Is it possible to have life in a volcano?
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.960]   I remember people,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.560]   like in that National Geographic program or something,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.640]   kind of hypothesizing that you can really have life anywhere
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.120]   so as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.400]   Do you think it's possible to have life in a volcano,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   like no water?
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.160]   - I think anything's possible.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.560]   (laughs)
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.760]   I think it's so, water, it doesn't have to be water.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.480]   That's sort of, you can tell as you identified,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.840]   I phrased that really carefully.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.120]   It's canonically accepted that.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.320]   Because we recognize that, you know,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.640]   scientists recognize that we have no idea
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.680]   what broad range of life could be out there,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.080]   and all we really have is our biases of life as we know it.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.760]   But for life as we know it, it's very helpful to have,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.320]   or even necessary to have some kind of liquid
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.680]   and preferably a polar solvent
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.920]   that can actually dissolve molecules, something like water.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.800]   So the case of liquid methane on Titan
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.960]   is less ideal from that perspective.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.560]   But you know, liquid magma,
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.600]   if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve,
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.480]   you have a heat source, you have a liquid,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.400]   you have nutrients.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.480]   In theory, that checks your three
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.400]   classic astrobiology boxes.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.320]   - That'd be fascinating.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.280]   To me, it'd be fascinating
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.480]   if it's possible to detect it easily.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.760]   How would we detect if there is life on Europa?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:41.600]   Is it possible to do in a non-contact way,
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.960]   from a distance, through telescopes and so on?
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:49.840]   Or do we need to send robots and do some drilling?
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.360]   - I think realistically, you need to do the drilling.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.200]   There's...
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.520]   So Europa also has these long tectonic features
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.400]   on its surface where it's thought that
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.560]   there's potential for water from the ocean
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.760]   to be somehow making its way up onto the surface.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.840]   And you could imagine some out there scenario
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.320]   where there's bacteria in the ocean,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.480]   it's somehow working its way up through the ice shell,
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.120]   it's spilling out on the surface,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.560]   it's being killed by the radiation,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.880]   but your instrument could detect
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.280]   some spectroscopic signature of that dead bacterium.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.880]   But that's many ifs and assumptions.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.720]   - That's a hope,
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.760]   because then you don't have to do that much drilling,
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.920]   you can collect from the surface.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.760]   - Right, or even-- - Skeletons and bacteria.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.920]   - I'm thinking even remotely.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.320]   - Oh, remotely.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.040]   That's sad that there's a single cell civilization
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.160]   living underneath all that ice,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.440]   trying to get up, trying to get out.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.000]   - So Enceladus gives you a slightly better chance of that
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.280]   because Enceladus is a moon of Saturn,
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.560]   and it's broadly similar to Europa in some ways.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.760]   It's an icy satellite, it has a subsurface ocean
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.280]   that's probably in touch with the rocky interior,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.120]   but it has these massive geysers at its south pole
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.600]   where it's spewing out material
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.880]   that appears to be originating all the way from the ocean.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.560]   And so in that case,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.840]   you could potentially fly through that plume
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.280]   and scoop up that material
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.640]   and hope that at the velocities you'd be scooping it up,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.200]   you're not destroying any signature
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.760]   of the life you're looking for.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.560]   But let's say that you have some ingenuity
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.440]   and can come up with a way to do that,
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.800]   it potentially gives you a more direct opportunity,
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.680]   at least to try to measure those bacteria directly.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.400]   - Can you tell me a little more on,
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.240]   how do you pronounce it?
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.080]   Celos?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.920]   - Enceladus.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.760]   - Enceladus?
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.600]   (laughs)
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.640]   Can you tell me a little bit more about Enceladus?
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:54.160]   Like we've been talking about way too much about Jupiter.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.000]   Saturn doesn't get enough love.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.840]   - Not enough really.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.680]   - Not enough.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.840]   (laughs)
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.240]   Saturn doesn't get as much love.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.000]   So what's Enceladus?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.040]   Is that the most exciting moon of Saturn?
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.400]   - Depends on your perspective.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.440]   It's very exciting from a astrobiology perspective.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.160]   I think Enceladus and Titan are the two most unique
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.800]   and interesting moons of Saturn.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.120]   They definitely both get the most attention
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.000]   also from the life perspective.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.360]   - So what's more likely, Titan or Enceladus for life?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:32.280]   If you were to bet all your money in terms of like investing
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.240]   which to investigate,
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.360]   what are the difference between the two
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.560]   that are interesting to you?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.200]   - Yeah, so the potential for life
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.160]   in each of those two places is very different.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.360]   So Titan is the one place in the solar system
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.200]   where you might imagine,
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.800]   again, all of this is so speculative,
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.280]   but you might imagine life evolving in the atmosphere.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.120]   So from a biology perspective,
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.520]   Titan is interesting because it forms
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.720]   complex organic molecules in its atmosphere.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.800]   It has a dense atmosphere.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.320]   It's actually denser than Earth's.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.840]   It's the only moon that has an atmosphere
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.680]   denser than Earth's.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.560]   - That's cool.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.040]   - It's got tons of methane in it.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.920]   What happens is that methane gets irradiated,
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.400]   it breaks up and it reforms
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.360]   with other things in the atmosphere.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.480]   It makes these complex organic molecules
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.760]   and it's effectively doing prebiotic chemistry
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.240]   in the atmosphere.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:25.160]   - While still being freezing cold?
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.120]   - Yes.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.080]   - Okay.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.640]   What would that be like?
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.200]   Would that be pleasant for humans to hang out there?
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.040]   Is it just really cold?
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.600]   - There's nowhere in the solar system
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.720]   that would be pleasant for humans.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.600]   It would be cold.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.520]   You couldn't breathe the air.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.200]   - What colonization wise,
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.320]   if there's an atmosphere,
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.840]   isn't that a big plus?
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.320]   Or still a ton of radiation?
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.040]   Okay, so.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.080]   Okay, so Titan,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.280]   that's a really nice feature
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.760]   that the life could be in the atmosphere
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.960]   'cause then it might be remotely observable
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.440]   or certainly is more accessible if you visit.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:05.160]   Okay, so what about Enceladus?
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.000]   So that would be still in the ocean.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.480]   - Right, and Enceladus has the advantage,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.360]   like I said, of spewing material out of its south pole
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.280]   so you could collect it.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.640]   But it has the disadvantage of the fact
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.160]   that we don't actually really understand
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.360]   how its ocean could stay frozen,
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.040]   or sorry, could stay globally liquid
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.960]   over the age of the solar system.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.280]   And so there are some models that say
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.880]   that it's going through this cyclical evolution
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   where the ocean freezes completely
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.160]   and thaws completely
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.360]   and the orbit sort of oscillates in and out
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.720]   of these eccentricities.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.920]   And in that case,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.520]   the potential for life ever occurring there
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.040]   in the first place is a lot lower
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.440]   because if you only have an ocean for 100 million years,
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.640]   is that enough time?
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.920]   - And it also means there might be mass extinction events
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.960]   if it does occur.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.360]   - Right. - And it just freezes.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.120]   Again, very sad, man.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   This is very depressing.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   All that like slaughter of life elsewhere.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.400]   How unlikely do you think life is on Earth?
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.640]   So when you look, when you study other planets
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.000]   and you study the contents of other planets,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.920]   does that give you a perspective
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.280]   on the origin of life on Earth?
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.920]   Which again is full of mystery in itself,
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.200]   not the evolution, but the origin,
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.960]   the first springing to life,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.920]   like from nothing to life,
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.720]   from the basic ingredients to life.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.800]   I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.520]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.560]   And it's one that just scientifically
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.640]   we don't have an answer to.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.120]   We don't even know how many times life evolved on Earth,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.200]   if it was only once
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.800]   or if it happened independently a thousand times
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.560]   in different places.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.600]   We don't know whether it's happened anywhere else
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   in the universe, although it feels absurd to believe
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.440]   that we are the only life that evolved
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.560]   in the entire universe, but it's conceivable.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.080]   We just have just no real information.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.440]   We don't understand really how life came about
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.240]   in the first place on Earth.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.600]   - I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.760]   that tries to estimate how many alien civilizations
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.600]   are out there,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.720]   planets have a big part to play in that equation.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.040]   If you were to bet money
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.320]   in terms of the odds of origins of life on Earth,
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.240]   I mean, this all has to do with how special
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.040]   and unique is Earth.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.640]   What you land in terms of the number of civilizations
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.840]   has to do with how unique the rare Earth hypothesis is.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.540]   How rare, special is Earth?
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.800]   How rare and special is the solar system?
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.440]   Like if you had to bet all your money
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.760]   on a completely unscientific question.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.880]   Well, no, it's actually a rigorously scientific,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.240]   we just don't know a lot of things in that equation.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.960]   There's a lot of mysteries about that.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.080]   And it's slowly becoming better and better understood
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.200]   in terms of exoplanets,
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.080]   in terms of how many solar systems are out there
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.640]   where there's planets, there are Earth-like planets.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.480]   It's getting better and better understood.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.760]   What's your sense from that perspective,
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.880]   how many alien civilizations out there?
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.080]   Zero or one plus?
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.320]   - You're right that the equation is being better understood,
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.680]   but you're really only talking about
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.440]   the first three parameters in the equation or something.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.480]   How many stars are there?
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.440]   How many planets per star?
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.980]   And then we're just barely scratching the surface
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.680]   of what fraction of those planets might be habitable.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.520]   The rest of the terms in the equation are like,
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.080]   how likely is life to evolve given habitable conditions?
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.440]   How likely is it to survive?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.360]   All these things.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.880]   There are all these huge unknowns.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.080]   Actually, I remember when I first saw that equation,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.480]   I think it was my first year of college.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.320]   And I thought, this is ridiculous.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   This is A, common sense that didn't need to give a name.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.460]   And B, just a bunch of unknowns.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.120]   It's like putting our ignorance together in one equation.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.600]   But I've actually, now I understand this equation.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.080]   It's not something we ever necessarily have the answer to.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.520]   It just gives us a framework for having
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.800]   the exact conversation we're having right now.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.400]   And I think that's how it was intended in the first place
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.320]   when it was put into writing was to give people a language
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.120]   to communicate about the factors that go into the potential
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.680]   for aliens to be out there and for us to find them.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.840]   I would put money on there being aliens.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   I would not put money on us having definitive evidence
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.980]   of them in my lifetime.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.920]   - Well, definitive is a funny word.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   'Cause my sense is, this is the saddest part for me,
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.600]   is my sense in terms of intelligent alien civilizations,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:08.680]   I feel like we're so self-obsessed
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.120]   that we literally would not be able to detect them
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.860]   even when they're in front of us.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.400]   Like trees could be aliens,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.400]   but just their intelligence could be realized on a scale,
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.760]   on a time scale or physical scale
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.200]   that we're not appreciating.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.760]   Like trees could be way more intelligent than us.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.580]   I don't know, it's just a dumb example.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.220]   Could be rocks, or it could be things like,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.220]   I love this, this is Dawkins memes.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:45.140]   It could be the ideas we have.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.380]   Like where do ideas come from?
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.900]   Where do thoughts come from?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.620]   Maybe thoughts are the aliens,
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.140]   or maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.580]   of communication in physics, right?
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.200]   This is like, we think of thoughts
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.880]   as something that springs up from neurons firing.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.240]   Where the hell did they come from?
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.920]   And now what about consciousness?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.200]   Maybe consciousness is the communication.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.500]   It sounds like ridiculous,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.840]   but like we're so self-centered
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.760]   on this space-time communication in physical space
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.080]   using like written language, like spoken with audio
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.580]   on a time scale that's very specific,
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.620]   on a physical scale that's very specific.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:35.880]   So I tend to think that bacteria will probably recognize,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.520]   like moving organisms will probably recognize,
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   but when that forms itself into intelligence,
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   most likely it'll be robots of some kind,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.560]   'cause we won't be meeting the origins.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.040]   We'll be meeting the creations of those intelligences.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.320]   We just would not be able to appreciate it,
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.200]   and that's the saddest thing to me,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   that we're too dumb to see aliens.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:05.000]   Like we're too, we kind of think like,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.680]   look at the progress of science.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.400]   We've accomplished so much.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.520]   The sad thing, it could be that we're just like
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.320]   in the first 0.0001% of understanding anything.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.160]   It's humbling.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.480]   - I hope that's true,
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.720]   because I feel like we're very ignorant as a species,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.040]   and I hope that our current level of knowledge
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.200]   only represents the 0.001% of what we will someday achieve.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.720]   That actually feels optimistic to me.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.840]   - Well, I feel like that's easier for us to comprehend
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.560]   in the space of biology,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.280]   and not as easy to comprehend in the space of physics,
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.720]   for example, because we have a sense that like,
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.920]   like if you talk to theoretical physicists,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.160]   they have a sense that we understand the basic laws
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   that form the nature of reality of our universe.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.720]   But so there's much more,
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.840]   like physicists are much more confident.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.000]   Biologists are like,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.560]   this is a squishy mess, we're doing our best.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.400]   But I would be, it'd be fascinating to see
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   if physicists themselves would also be humbled
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.160]   by their being, like what the hell is dark matter
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.560]   and dark energy?
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.200]   What the hell is the, not just the origin,
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.280]   not just the Big Bang,
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.200]   but everything that happened since the Big Bang?
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.800]   A lot of things that happened since the Big Bang
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.440]   we have no ideas about except basic models of physics.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.600]   - Right, or what happened before the Big Bang?
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.160]   - Yeah, yeah, what happened before?
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.080]   Or what's happening inside a black hole?
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.360]   Why is there a black hole at the center of our galaxy?
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.400]   Can somebody answer this?
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   A supermassive black hole, nobody knows how it started,
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.160]   and they seem to be like in the middle of all galaxies.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.080]   So that could be a portal for aliens
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.680]   to communicate through consciousness, okay.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.040]   All right, back to planets.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.140]   What's your favorite, outside of Earth,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.520]   what's your favorite planet or moon?
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.800]   Maybe outside of the ones,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.760]   well first, have we talked about it already?
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.560]   Or, and then if we did mention it,
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.120]   what's the one outside of that?
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.160]   - Oh gosh, I have to come up with another favorite
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   that's not Io?
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.080]   - Oh, Io's the favorite.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.920]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.600]   - Why is Io the favorite?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.400]   - I mean, basically everything I've already said.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.580]   It's just such an amazing and unique object.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.420]   But on, I guess, a personal note,
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.120]   it's probably the object
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.540]   that made me become a planetary scientist.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.660]   It's the first thing in the solar system
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.920]   that really deeply captured my interest.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:38.640]   And when I started my PhD,
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.840]   I wanted to be an astrophysicist
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.000]   working on things like galaxy evolution.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.240]   And sort of slowly,
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.360]   I had done some projects in the solar system,
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.840]   but Io was the thing that really caught me
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.600]   into doing solar system science.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.840]   - Okay, let's leave moons aside.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.880]   What's your favorite planet?
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.040]   It sounds like you like moons better than planets.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.240]   So let's--
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.360]   - That's accurate.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.760]   But the planets are fascinating.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.800]   I think, you know,
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.480]   I find the planets in the solar system really fascinating.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.040]   What I like about the moons is that
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.960]   there's so much less that is known.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.840]   There's still a lot more discovery space
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.520]   and the questions that we can ask
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.840]   are still the bigger questions.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.680]   - Gotcha.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.520]   - Which, you know,
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.120]   and maybe I'm being unfair to the planets
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.760]   because we're still trying to understand things
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.540]   like was there ever life on Mars?
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.960]   And that is a huge question
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.920]   and one that we've sent numerous robots to Mars
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.360]   to try to answer.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.680]   So maybe I'm being unfair to the planets.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.520]   But there is certainly quite a bit more information
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.040]   that we have about the planets than the moons.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.180]   But I mean, Venus is a fascinating object.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   So I like the objects that lie at the extremes.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.560]   I think that if we can make a sort of theory
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.880]   or like I've been saying,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   framework for understanding planets and moons
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.560]   that can incorporate even the most extreme ones,
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.920]   then, you know, those are the things
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.200]   that really test your theory and test your understanding.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   So they've always really fascinated me.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.560]   Not so much the nice habitable places like Earth,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.240]   but these extreme places like Venus
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:20.160]   that have sulfuric acid clouds
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:23.480]   and just incredibly hot and dense surfaces.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.200]   And Venus, of course, I love volcanism for some reason.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.360]   And Venus has, probably has volcanic activity,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.160]   definitely has in their recent past,
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.600]   maybe has ongoing today.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.800]   - What do you make of the news?
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.000]   Maybe you can update it in terms of life being discovered
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.120]   in the atmosphere of Venus.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.280]   Is that, sorry, okay.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.120]   You have an opinion.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.960]   I can already tell you have opinions.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.600]   Was that fake news?
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   I got excited when I saw that.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.320]   What's the final, is there a life on Venus?
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.440]   - So the detection that was reported
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.780]   was the detection of the molecule phosphine.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:06.640]   And they said that they tried every other mechanism
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.480]   they could think of to produce phosphine
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.600]   and no mechanism worked.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.720]   And then they said, well, we know that life produces phosphine
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.460]   and so that was sort of the train of logic.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:24.360]   And I don't personally believe that phosphine
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.320]   was detected in the first place.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.760]   - Okay, so then, I mean, this is just one study,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   but I, as a layman, am skeptical a little bit
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.600]   about tools that sense the contents of an atmosphere,
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   like contents of an atmosphere from remotely
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.240]   and making conclusive statements about life.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.600]   - Oh, yeah, well, that connection that you just made,
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.240]   the contents of the atmosphere to the life
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.460]   is a tricky one.
[00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:58.720]   And yeah, I know that that claim received a lot of criticism
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.280]   for the lines of logic that went from detection
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.840]   to claim of life.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.280]   Even the detection itself, though,
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   doesn't meet the sort of historical scientific standards
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.180]   of a detection.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:18.100]   It was a very tenuous detection
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.600]   and only one line of the species was detected
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.320]   and a lot of really complicated data analysis methods
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.880]   had to be applied to even make that weak detection.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.920]   - Yeah, so it could be noise, it could be polluted data,
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.240]   it could be all those things.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.440]   And so it doesn't meet the level of rigor
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.080]   that you would hope, but of course,
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.560]   I mean, we're doing our best.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.640]   And it's clear that the human species
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.000]   are hopeful to find life.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.240]   - Clearly, yes.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.160]   Everyone is so excited about that possibility.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.480]   - All right, let me ask you about Mars.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.640]   So there's a guy named Elon Musk
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.240]   and he seems to wanna take something called Dogecoin there.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.140]   First of the moon.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.980]   I'm just kidding about the Dogecoin.
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:16.300]   I don't even know what the heck is up with that whole.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.300]   I think humor has power in the 21st century
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:28.440]   in a way to spread ideas in the most positive way.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:32.640]   So I love that kind of humor
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.580]   'cause it makes people smile,
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.180]   but it also kinda sneak,
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.660]   it's like a Trojan horse for cool ideas.
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.460]   You open with humor and you,
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.360]   like the humor is the appetizer
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.980]   and then the main meal is the science and the engineering.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.980]   Anyway, do you think it's possible to colonize Mars
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:50:00.500]   or other planets in the solar system,
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.180]   but we're especially looking to Mars.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.440]   Is there something about planets
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.940]   that make them very harsh to humans?
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.300]   Is there something in particular you think about
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.600]   and maybe in a high, like big picture perspective,
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.000]   do you have a hope we do in fact
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.820]   become a multi-planetary species?
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:24.760]   - I do think that if our species survives long enough
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.780]   and we don't wipe ourselves out
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.580]   or get wiped out by some other means
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:33.580]   that we will eventually be able to colonize other planets.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.460]   I do not expect that to happen in my lifetime.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.020]   I mean, tourists may go to Mars, tourists,
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.040]   people who commit years of their life
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.640]   to go into Mars as a tourist may go to Mars.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.500]   I don't think that we will colonize it.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.740]   - Is there a sense why it's just too harsh
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.220]   for an environment to,
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.940]   like it's too costly to build something habitable there
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.600]   for a large population?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.420]   - I think that we need to do a lot of work
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.900]   in learning how to use the resources
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.420]   that are on the planet already to do the things we need.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.200]   So if you're talking about someone going there
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.460]   for a few months,
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.420]   so I'll back up a little bit.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.460]   There are many things that make Mars
[00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.620]   not hospitable, temperature, you can't breathe the air,
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.460]   you need a pressure suit, even if you're on the surface,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.540]   the radiation environment is,
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:28.620]   even in all of those things,
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.340]   the radiation environment is too harsh for the human body.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:36.060]   All of those things seem like they could eventually have
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.160]   technological solutions.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:43.780]   The challenge, the real significant challenge to me
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.240]   seems to be the creation
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.820]   of a self-sustaining civilization there.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.800]   You can bring pressure suits,
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.480]   you can bring oxygen to breathe,
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.120]   but those are all in limited supply.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.320]   And if we're gonna colonize it,
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.920]   we need to find ways to make use of the resources
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:03.120]   that are there to do things like produce food,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.280]   produce the air that humans need to keep breathing,
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.060]   just in order to make it self-sustaining,
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.540]   there's a tremendous amount of work that has to be done.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.900]   And people are working on these problems,
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.540]   but I think that's gonna be a major obstacle
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.360]   in going from visiting where we can bring everything
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.180]   we need to survive in the short term
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.800]   to actually colonizing.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.640]   - Yeah, I find that whole project
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.240]   of the human species quite inspiring,
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.860]   these like huge moonshot projects.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.260]   Somebody, I was reading something
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.580]   in terms of the source of food
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.580]   that may be the most effective on Mars
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.700]   is you could farm insects.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.860]   That's the easiest thing to farm.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.300]   So we'll be eating like cockroaches
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.980]   before living on Mars,
[00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.140]   'cause that's the easiest thing to actually,
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.580]   as a source of protein.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.060]   So growing a source of protein
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.700]   is the easiest thing as insects.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.020]   I just imagine this giant,
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.140]   for people who are afraid of insects,
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.980]   this is not a pleasant,
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.180]   maybe you're not supposed to even think of it that way.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:09.820]   It'll be like a cockroach milkshake or something like that.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.100]   - Right, I wonder,
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.780]   have people been working on the genetic engineering
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.180]   of insects to make them-
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.660]   - Radiation friendly.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.220]   - Right, or pressure resistant or whatever,
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.420]   to make them more-
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.380]   - What can possibly go wrong?
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.820]   Cockroaches become radiation resistant.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.420]   They're already like survived everything.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.820]   Plus I took an allergy test in Austin.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.540]   So there's everybody's like,
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   the allergy levels are super high there.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.860]   And one of the things apparently,
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.220]   I'm not allergic to any insects except cockroaches.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.260]   It's hilarious.
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:48.900]   So maybe, well, I'm gonna use that as,
[00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.100]   you know how people use an excuse
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:53.020]   that I'm allergic to cats, to not have cats.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.940]   I'm gonna use that as an excuse to not go to Mars
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.900]   as one of the first batch of people.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:58.940]   - I was gonna ask,
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.140]   if you had the opportunity, would you go?
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.140]   - Yeah, I'm joking about the cockroach thing.
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.060]   I would definitely go.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.380]   I love challenges.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:11.580]   I love doing things where the possibility of death
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.460]   is not insignificant.
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.700]   'Cause it makes me appreciate it more.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:26.380]   Meditating on death makes me appreciate life.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:32.460]   And when the meditation on death is forced on you,
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.860]   'cause of how difficult the task is,
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.620]   I enjoy those kinds of things.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.900]   Most people don't, it seems like.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.340]   But I love the idea of difficult journeys
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:47.980]   for no purpose whatsoever except exploration,
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.660]   going into the unknown,
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.540]   seeing what the limits of the human mind
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:53.260]   and the human body are.
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.340]   It's like, what the hell else is this whole journey
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.420]   that we're on for?
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.140]   But it could be 'cause I grew up in the Soviet Union.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.940]   There is a kind of love for space,
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.180]   like the space race, the Cold War created.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.460]   I don't know if still it permeates American culture as much,
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.100]   but especially with the dad as a scientist,
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:18.660]   I think I've loved the idea of humans
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.740]   striving out towards the stars, always.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:23.860]   Like from the engineering perspective,
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.820]   has been really exciting.
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.100]   I don't know if people love that as much in America anymore.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.420]   I think Elon is bringing that back a little bit,
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.660]   that excitement about rockets and going out there.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.100]   But so that's hopeful.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:37.940]   But for me, I always loved that idea.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.900]   From an alien scientist perspective,
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:43.500]   if you were to look back on earth,
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:49.260]   is there something interesting you could say about earth?
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.060]   Like how would you summarize earth?
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.900]   You know, like "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.940]   Like if you had to report, like write a paper on earth
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.540]   or like a letter, like a one pager,
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:05.540]   summarizing the contents of the surface and the atmosphere.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.140]   Is there something interesting?
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.700]   Like, do you ever take that kind of perspective on it?
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.340]   - I know you like volcanism,
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.100]   so volcanoes, that'll probably be in the report.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.620]   - I was gonna say, that's where I was gonna go first.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.260]   There are a few things to say about the atmosphere,
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.500]   but in terms of the volcanoes,
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.340]   so one of the really interesting puzzles
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.420]   to me in planetary science is,
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.060]   so we can look out there and we've been talking about
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.740]   surfaces and volcanoes and atmospheres and things like that.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:36.580]   But that is just, you know, this tiny little veneer
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.660]   on the outside of the planet.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.180]   And most of the planet is completely
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.060]   sort of inaccessible to telescopes
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.180]   or to spacecraft missions.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.820]   You can drill a meter into the surface,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.060]   but you know, that's still really the veneer.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:52.060]   And one of the cool puzzles is looking at what's going on
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:54.820]   on the surface and trying to figure out
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.220]   what's happening underneath,
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.180]   or just any kind of indirect means
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.740]   that you have to study the interior
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.860]   because you can't dig into it directly, even on earth,
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.580]   you can't dig deep into earth.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.660]   So from that perspective, looking at earth,
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:14.340]   one thing that you would be able to tell from orbit,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:18.580]   given enough time, is that earth has tectonic plates.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.820]   So you would see that volcanoes follow the edges.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.620]   If you trace where all the volcanoes are on earth,
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.140]   they follow these lines that trace the edges of the plates.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.260]   And similarly, you would see things like
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:35.260]   the Hawaiian string of volcanoes that you could infer,
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:39.020]   just like we did as people actually living on earth,
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:41.300]   that the plates are moving over some plume
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.820]   that's coming up through the mantle.
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.540]   And so you could use that to say,
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.620]   if the aliens could look at where the volcanoes
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.100]   are happening on earth and say something about
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:51.620]   the fact that earth has plate tectonics,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.340]   which makes it really unique in the solar system.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.580]   - So the other planets don't have plate tectonics?
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.180]   - It's the only one that has plate tectonics, yeah.
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:02.420]   - What about Io and the friction and all that,
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.540]   that's not plate tectonics?
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:05.140]   What's the difference between,
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.340]   so oh, it's plate tectonics,
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.060]   like another layer of like solid rock
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:12.740]   that moves around and there's cracks.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:16.380]   - Yeah, so earth has plates of solid rock
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.220]   sitting on top of a partially molten layer,
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.620]   and those plates are kind of shifting around.
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.860]   On Io, it doesn't have that,
[00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.740]   and the volcanism is what we call heat pipe volcanism.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.580]   It's the magma just punches a hole through the crust
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:32.820]   and comes out on the surface.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.140]   I mean, that's a simplification,
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.180]   but that's effectively what's happening.
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.780]   - Through the freezing cold crust.
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:42.060]   - Yes, very cold, very rigid crust, yeah.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.280]   - How does that look like, by the way?
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.620]   I don't think we've mentioned,
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.540]   so the gas that's expelled,
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.780]   like if we were to look at it,
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.940]   is it beautiful or is it like boring?
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:52.780]   - The gas?
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:54.100]   - Like the whole thing,
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.380]   like the magma punching through the icy--
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.900]   - Yes, I'm sure it would be beautiful,
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:00.660]   and the pictures we've seen of it are beautiful.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.820]   You have, so the magma will come out of the lava,
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.500]   will come out of these fissures,
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.940]   and you have these curtains of lava
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:13.580]   that are maybe even a kilometer high.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.060]   So if you looked at videos,
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:16.820]   I don't know how many volcano videos
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:17.660]   you've looked at on Earth,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:20.020]   but you sometimes see a tiny, tiny version of this.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.140]   In Iceland, you see just these sheets of magma
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.540]   coming out of a fissure
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.900]   when you have this really low viscosity magma,
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.500]   sort of water-like coming out at these sheets.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.340]   And the plumes that come out,
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.580]   because there's no atmosphere,
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:36.700]   all the plume molecules are just,
[00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:38.300]   or plume particles,
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.740]   where they end up is just a function
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.660]   of the direction that they left the vent,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.460]   so they're all following ballistic trajectories.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.820]   And you end up with these umbrella plumes.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.700]   You don't get these sort of complicated plumes
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.260]   that you have on Earth that are occurring
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.140]   because of how that material's interacting
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.620]   with the atmosphere that's there.
[00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.580]   You just have these huge umbrellas.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.220]   And it's been hypothesized, actually,
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.100]   that the atmosphere's made of sulfur dioxide
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.500]   and that you could have these kind of ash particles
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:08.340]   from the volcano,
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.980]   and the sulfur dioxide would condense onto these particles,
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.900]   and you'd have sulfur dioxide snow
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.700]   coming out of these volcanic plumes.
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.220]   - And there's not much light, though, right?
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.260]   So you wouldn't be able to,
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.860]   like, it would not make a good Instagram photo
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.540]   'cause you have to,
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.460]   would you see the snow?
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.300]   - Sure.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.140]   There's light.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:30.980]   It depends.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.820]   - Oh, okay, so you could, okay.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.420]   - Depends what angle you're looking at it,
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.220]   where the sun is, all the things like that.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.700]   You know, the sunlight is much weaker,
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.540]   but it's still there.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.380]   - It's still there.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.860]   And how big is Io in terms of gravity?
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:44.900]   Is it smaller?
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.180]   Is it a pretty small moon?
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:49.820]   - It's quite a bit smaller than Earth, anyway.
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.780]   - It's smaller than Earth, okay.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.620]   Okay, cool.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.700]   So they float out for a little bit.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.780]   So the floats, yeah, no, you're right.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.860]   That would be gorgeous.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.700]   What else about Earth is interesting besides volcanoes?
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.740]   So plate tectonics,
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.740]   I didn't realize that that was a unique element
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.660]   of a planet in the solar system.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:14.500]   'Cause that, I wonder what,
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.300]   I mean, we experience it as human beings.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.940]   It's quite painful because of earthquakes
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:18.820]   and all those kinds of things,
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.620]   but I wonder if there's nice features to it.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.900]   - Yeah, so coming back to habitability again,
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.220]   things like tectonics and plate tectonics
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.740]   are thought to play an important role
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.100]   in the surface being habitable.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.740]   And that's because you have a way of recycling materials.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:39.380]   So if you have a stagnant surface,
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.820]   everything, you use up all the free oxygen,
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:45.260]   everything reacts until you no longer have reactants
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.940]   that life can extract energy from.
[01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.740]   And so if nothing's changing on your surface,
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.980]   you kind of reach this stagnation point.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:57.140]   But something like plate tectonics recycles material.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.420]   You bring up new fresh material from the interior,
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.220]   you bring down material that's up on the surface,
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.900]   and that can kind of refresh your nutrient supply
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.180]   in a sense, or the sort of raw materials
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.820]   that the surface has to work with.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:16.820]   So from a kind of astrobiologist perspective,
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:20.300]   looking at Earth, you would see that recycling of material
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.420]   because the plate tectonics,
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.060]   you would also see how much oxygen is in Earth's atmosphere.
[01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.340]   And between those two things,
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.140]   you would identify Earth as a reasonable candidate
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.020]   for a habitable environment.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.020]   In addition to of course,
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.180]   the pleasant temperature and liquid water.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.780]   But the abundance of oxygen and the plate tectonics
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.180]   both play a role as well.
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.980]   - And also see like tiny dot satellites flying around.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.820]   - Well, sure, yes.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.020]   - I wonder if they would be able to,
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:48.940]   I really think about that.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.860]   Like if aliens were to visit,
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.900]   and would they really see humans
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.960]   as the thing they should be focusing on?
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.140]   I think it would take a while, right?
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.940]   Is it so obvious that that should,
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.900]   'cause there's like so much incredible,
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.500]   in terms of biomass,
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.060]   humans are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.160]   There's like ants.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.980]   They would probably detect ants, right?
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.900]   Or they probably would focus on the water and the fish.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.300]   'Cause there's like a lot of water.
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.220]   I was surprised to learn that there's more species on land
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.940]   than there is in the sea.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.120]   Like there's 90,
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.260]   I think 90 to 95% of the species are on land.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.380]   - Or on land, or not in the sea.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.700]   - Not in the sea.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:34.940]   I thought like there's so much going on in the sea,
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.380]   but no, the variety that like the branches
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.780]   created by evolution,
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.220]   apparently it's probably a good answer
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.900]   from evolutionary biology perspective,
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.900]   why land created so much diversity, but it did.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.020]   So like the sea,
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:50.700]   there's so much not known about the sea,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.660]   about the oceans,
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:56.660]   but it's not diversity friendly.
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.220]   What can I say?
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.500]   It needs to improve its diversity.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.220]   - Do you think the aliens would come?
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:04.620]   I mean, the first thing they would see is,
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:05.940]   I suppose, are cities.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.340]   Assuming that they had some idea
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.100]   of what a natural world looked like,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.380]   they would see cities and say, "These don't belong.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.980]   Which of these many species created these?"
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.620]   - Yeah, I mean, if I were to guess,
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.620]   it's a good question.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.740]   I don't know if you do this,
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.980]   when you look at the telescope,
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.620]   whether you look at geometric shapes.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:34.980]   'Cause to me, like hard corners,
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.780]   like what do we think is engineered?
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.900]   Things that are like,
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.880]   have kind of straight lines and corners and so on.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.200]   They will probably detect those
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.500]   in terms of buildings would stand out to them.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.500]   Because that goes against
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.980]   the basic natural physics of the world.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:56.700]   But I don't know if the electricity and lights and so on,
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.540]   it could be,
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.100]   I honestly, it could be the plate tectonics.
[01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.500]   It could be like, hmm,
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.220]   that like the volcanoes,
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:05.820]   that'd be okay, that's a source of heat.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.100]   And then they would focus.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.860]   They might literally,
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.340]   I mean, depending on how alien life forms are,
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.740]   they might notice the microorganisms
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.020]   before they notice the big,
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.120]   like notice the ant before the elephant.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.640]   'Cause like there's a lot more of them,
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.980]   depending what they're measuring device.
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.420]   We think like size matters,
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.700]   but maybe with their tools of measurement,
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:32.300]   they would look for quantity versus size.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.540]   Like why focus on the big thing,
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.860]   focus on the thing that there's a lot of.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.940]   And when they see humans,
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.520]   depending on their measurement devices,
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.660]   they might see we're made up of billions of organisms.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.220]   Like the fact that we're very human,
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.900]   we think we're one organism,
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.860]   but that may not be the case.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:50.940]   They might see, in fact,
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.420]   they may also see like a human city as one organism.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.980]   Like what is this thing that like,
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.740]   clearly this organism gets aroused at night
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.980]   'cause the lights go on.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:10.180]   And then it like, it sleeps during the day.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.900]   I don't know.
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:15.060]   Like what perspective you take on the city.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.420]   Is there something interesting about earth
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.820]   or other planets in terms of weather patterns?
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:25.820]   So we talked a lot about volcanic patterns.
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.980]   Is there something else about weather that's interesting,
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:34.420]   like storms or variations in temperature,
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.720]   all those kinds of things?
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.540]   - Yeah, so there's sort of,
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.220]   every planet and moon has a kind of interesting
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.740]   and unique weather pattern.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:48.400]   And those weather patterns are really,
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.780]   we don't have a good understanding of them.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.180]   We don't even have a good understanding
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.860]   of the global circulation patterns
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:58.740]   of many of these atmospheres,
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.420]   why the storm systems occur.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:05.420]   So the composition and occurrence of storms
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.860]   and clouds and these objects
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.940]   is another one of these kind of windows into the interior
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.680]   that I was talking about with surfaces.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.500]   One of these ways that we can get perspective
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.500]   and what the composition is of the interior
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.340]   and how the circulation is working.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.600]   So circulation will bring some species up
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.740]   from deeper in the atmosphere of the planet
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.820]   to some altitude that's a little bit colder
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.360]   and that species will condense out
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.340]   and form a cloud at that altitude.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.500]   And we can detect in some cases
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   what those clouds are composed of.
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.940]   And looking at where those occur
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.620]   can tell you how the circulation cells are,
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.020]   whether the atmospheric circulation is say,
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.980]   coming up at the equator and going down at the poles
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.300]   or whether you have multiple cells in the atmosphere.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.820]   And I mean, Jupiter's atmosphere is just insane.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:58.900]   There's so much going on.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900]   You look at these pictures
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.540]   and there's all these vortices and anti-vortices
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.980]   and you have these different bands
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.600]   that are moving in opposite directions
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.320]   that may be giving you information
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:14.320]   about the deep in the atmosphere,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.100]   physically deep properties
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.100]   of Jupiter's interior and circulation.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.380]   - What are these vortices?
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:27.620]   What's the basic material of the storms?
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.020]   - It's condensed molecules from the atmosphere.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.460]   So ammonia ice particles in the case of Jupiter,
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:37.160]   it's methane ice in the case of let's say Uranus and Neptune
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:40.040]   and other species, you can kind of construct
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.720]   a chemical model for which species can condense where.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.440]   And so you see a cloud at a certain altitude
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.320]   within the atmosphere and you can make a guess
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:48.960]   at what that cloud is made of
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.800]   and sometimes measure it directly
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.080]   and different species make different colors as well.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.000]   - Oh, cool.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.320]   Ice storms, okay.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.760]   - I mean, the climate of Uranus
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.760]   has always been fascinating to me
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.360]   because it orbits on its side
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.360]   and it has a 42 year orbital period.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.600]   And so, with earth, our seasons are
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.880]   because our equator is tipped just a little bit
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.160]   to the plane that we orbit in.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.400]   So sometimes the sunlight's a little bit above the equator
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:17.360]   and sometimes it's a little bit below the equator.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.880]   But on Uranus, it's like for 10 years,
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   the sunlight is directly on the North Pole
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.280]   and then it's directly on the equator
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.520]   and then it's directly on the South Pole.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.200]   And it's actually kind of amazing
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.360]   that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier than it does.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.600]   But understanding how, taking again,
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.400]   like one of these extreme examples,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.320]   if we can understand why that atmosphere behaves
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.560]   in the way it does, it's kind of a test
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.760]   of our understanding of how atmosphere is.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.760]   - So like heats up one side of the planet for 10 years
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.360]   and then freezes it the next,
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.240]   and that you're saying should probably lead to some chaos
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.720]   and it doesn't.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.600]   - The fact that it doesn't tells you something
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.760]   about the atmosphere.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.160]   So atmospheres have a property that surfaces don't have,
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.720]   which is that they can redistribute heat
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.640]   a lot more effectively.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.280]   - So they're a stabilizing, like self-regulating aspect
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.180]   to them that they're able to deal with extreme conditions.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:24.520]   But predicting how that complex system unrolls
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.640]   is very difficult as we know
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.560]   about predicting the weather on earth even.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.400]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.360]   - Even with a little variation we have on earth.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.640]   - You know, people have tried to put together
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.000]   global circulation models.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.100]   So, you know, we've done this for earth.
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.600]   People have tried to do these for other planets as well.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.700]   And it is a really hard problem.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.440]   So Titan, for example, like I said,
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.480]   it's one of the best studied atmospheres
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.320]   in the solar system.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.560]   And people have tried to make these global circulation models
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.640]   and actually predict what's going to happen
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.000]   moving into sort of the next season of Titan.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   And those predictions have ended up being wrong.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.120]   And so then, you know, I don't know,
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.880]   it's always exciting when a prediction is wrong
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.520]   because it means that there's something more to learn.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.920]   Like your theory wasn't sufficient.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.640]   And then you get to go back and learn something
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.340]   by how you have to modify the theory to make it fit.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.840]   - I'm excited by the possibility of one day
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.920]   there'll be for various moons and planets,
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.680]   there'll be like news programs reporting the weather
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.640]   with the fake confidence of like,
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.360]   as if you can predict the weather.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.520]   We talked quite a bit about planets and moons.
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.760]   Can we talk a little bit about asteroids?
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.600]   - For sure.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.840]   - What's an asteroid and what kind of asteroids are there?
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.540]   - So the asteroids, let's talk about just the,
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.960]   restricted to the main asteroid belt, which is the region.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.960]   It's a region of debris basically between Mars and Jupiter.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And the, these sort of belts of debris
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.560]   throughout the solar system, the outer solar system,
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.120]   you know, the Kuiper belt that we talked about,
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.640]   the asteroid belt, as well as certain other populations
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.720]   where they accumulate
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.400]   because they're gravitationally more favored,
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.560]   are remnant objects from the origin of the solar system.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.040]   And so one of the reasons that we are so interested in them,
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.480]   aside from potentially the fact
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.880]   that they could come hit Earth,
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.560]   but scientifically it's,
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:29.400]   it gives us a window into understanding the composition
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.600]   of the material from which Earth
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.160]   and the other planets formed
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.440]   and how that material was kind of redistributed
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.840]   over the history of the solar system.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.760]   So the asteroids,
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.040]   one could classify them in two different ways.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.880]   Some of them are ancient objects.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.480]   that the whole solar system formed out of
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.240]   They've probably collided with each other
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.360]   and we see all these collisional fragments.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.640]   And you can actually look and based on their orbits,
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.160]   say, you know, like these 50 objects
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.240]   originated as the same object.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.440]   You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.960]   after some big collision.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.400]   And so some of them are these ancient objects,
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.000]   maybe that have undergone collisions.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.200]   And then there's this other category of object
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.960]   that is the one that I personally find really interesting,
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.960]   which is remnants of objects that could have been planets.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.160]   So early on, a bunch of potential planets accreted
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.600]   that we call planetesimals and they formed
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.920]   and they formed with a lot of energy
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.100]   and they had enough time to actually differentiate.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.800]   So some of these objects differentiated
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.280]   into cores and mantles and crusts.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.040]   And then they were subsequently distracted
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.000]   in these massive collisions.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.440]   And now we have these fragments,
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.000]   we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.320]   that are like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crust.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.120]   - Cool. - Basically.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.160]   - So it's like puzzle pieces
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.480]   that you might be able to stitch together
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.800]   or I guess it's all mixed up
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.200]   so you can't stitch together the original planet candidates
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.040]   or is that possible to try to see if they kind of,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.920]   I mean, there's too many objects in there to.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.240]   - I think that there are cases
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.000]   where people have kind of looked at objects
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.580]   and by looking at their orbits,
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.000]   they say these objects should have originated together
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.520]   but they have very different compositions.
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.600]   And so then you can hypothesize
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.160]   maybe they were different fragments
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.840]   of a differentiated object.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.240]   But one of the really cool things about this is,
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.320]   we've been talking about getting clues
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.480]   into the interiors of planets.
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:57.440]   We've never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.360]   Some mantle material comes up on our surface
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.700]   and then we can see it, but in sort of in bulk.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.080]   We haven't seen these things directly
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.360]   and these asteroids potentially give us a chance
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:12.160]   to look at what our own core and mantle is like
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.760]   or at least would be like
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.720]   if it had been also floating through space
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.080]   for a few billion years and getting irradiated and all that.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.920]   But it's a cool potential window
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.440]   or like analogy into the interior of our own planet.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.640]   - Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids?
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:32.800]   If you were to put together a study,
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.520]   what are the interesting questions to ask
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.000]   that are a little bit more specific?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.800]   Like, do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.720]   and try to track it through telescopes?
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.960]   Or do you, is it has to be,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.680]   you have to land on those things to study it?
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.720]   - So when it comes to the asteroids,
[01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.520]   there are so many of them and the big pictures
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:02.280]   or the big questions are answered
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.120]   by the big picture.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.920]   So some questions can be answered
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.240]   by zooming in in detail on individual object,
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.880]   but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.640]   So you wanna look at thousands of objects,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.920]   even hundreds of thousands of objects
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:21.440]   and figure out what their composition is
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.600]   and look at how many big asteroids
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.880]   there are of this composition
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.240]   versus how many small asteroids of this other composition
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.840]   and put together these kind of statistical properties
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.040]   of the asteroid belt.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.960]   And those properties can be directly compared
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.120]   with the results of simulations
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.360]   for the formation of the solar system.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.640]   - What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.240]   or the contents of the insides of asteroids
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.840]   and what are still open questions?
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.720]   - So I would say that we don't know a whole lot
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.800]   about their compositions.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.000]   Most of them are small
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   and so you can't study them in such detail with telescopes
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.640]   as you could a planet or moon.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.400]   And at the same time, because there are so many of them,
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.880]   you could send a spacecraft to a few,
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.280]   but you can't really like get a statistical survey
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.160]   with spacecraft.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.240]   And so a lot of what has been done
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.960]   comes down to sort of classification.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.880]   You look at how bright they are,
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.200]   you look at whether they're red or blue,
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.600]   simply whether their spectrum is sloped
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.840]   towards long wavelengths or short wavelengths.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.080]   There are certain,
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.600]   if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces,
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.040]   there are certain features you can see.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.880]   So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.440]   But these are the sort of,
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.800]   they're pretty basic questions.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.360]   We're still trying to classify them
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   based on fairly basic information
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.960]   in kind of combination with our general understanding
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.240]   of the material the solar system formed from.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.520]   And so you're sort of,
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.320]   you're coming in with prior knowledge,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.600]   which is that you more or less know what the materials are
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.720]   the solar system formed from,
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.560]   and then you're trying to classify them
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.120]   into these categories.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.400]   There's still a huge amount of room
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.760]   for understanding them better
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.240]   and for understanding how their surfaces are changing
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.920]   in the space environment.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.800]   - Is it hard to land on an asteroid?
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:25.840]   Is this a dumb question?
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.320]   It feels like it would be quite difficult
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.480]   to actually operate a spacecraft
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   in such a dense field of debris.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.000]   - Oh, the asteroid belt,
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.520]   there's a ton of material there,
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.840]   but it's actually not that dense.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.480]   It is mostly open space.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.320]   - Okay.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.240]   - So mentally do picture like mostly open space
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.200]   with some rocks.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.600]   - The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.680]   So some of these asteroids,
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.960]   especially these core mantle fragments,
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.560]   you can think of as sort of solid like a planet,
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.480]   but some of them are just kind of aggregates of material.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.560]   We call them rubble piles.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.680]   And so there's not necessarily-
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.800]   - Might look like a rock,
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.120]   but do a lot of them have kind of clouds around them,
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:17.000]   like a dust cloud thing,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.960]   or like, do you know what you're stepping on
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.360]   when you try to land on it?
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:26.200]   Like, what are we supposed to be visualizing here?
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.920]   This is like very few have water, right?
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.200]   - There's some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt,
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.640]   but they're not quite like comets.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.480]   - Okay.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.200]   - In the sense of having clouds around them.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.280]   There are some crazy asteroids
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.000]   that do become active like comets.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.400]   That's the whole other category of thing
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.680]   that we don't understand.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.120]   But their surfaces, I mean, we have visited some,
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.160]   you can find pictures that spacecraft have taken of them.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.680]   And we've actually scooped up material
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.600]   off of the surface of some of these objects.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.560]   We're bringing it back to analyze it in the lab.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:01.520]   And there's a mission that's launching next year
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.560]   to land on one of these supposedly core fragment objects
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.160]   to try to figure out what the heck it is
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.000]   and what's going on with it.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   But the surfaces, you can picture a solid surface
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:19.080]   with some little grains of sand or pebbles on it
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.960]   and occasional boulders, maybe some fine dusty regions,
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.240]   dust kind of collecting in certain places.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.440]   - Do you worry about this?
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:35.440]   Is there any chance that one of these fellas
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.920]   destroys all of human civilization
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.920]   by an asteroid kind of colliding with something,
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.360]   changing its trajectory
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.360]   and then heading its way towards earth?
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.280]   - That is definitely possible.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.480]   And it doesn't even have to necessarily collide with something
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.120]   and change its trajectory.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.960]   We're not tracking all of them.
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.800]   We can't track all of them yet.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.040]   You know, there's still-
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.680]   - A lot of them.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.600]   - People are tracking a lot of them
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.440]   and we are doing our best to track more of them.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.800]   But there are a lot of them out there
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.360]   and it would be potentially catastrophic
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.000]   if one of them impacted earth.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.880]   - Are you aware of this Apophis object?
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:20.760]   So there's an asteroid, a near earth object called Apophis
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.800]   that people thought had a decent probability
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.880]   of hitting earth in 2029
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.760]   and then potentially again in 2036.
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.800]   So they did a lot of studies.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:31.720]   It's not actually going to hit earth
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.960]   but it is going to come very close.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.680]   It's gonna be visible in the sky in a relatively dark,
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.440]   I mean, not even that dark,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.760]   probably not visible from Los Angeles.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:49.560]   And it's gonna come a 10th of the way
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.680]   between the earth and the moon.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.280]   It's gonna come closer apparently
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.120]   than some geosynchronous communication satellites.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:56.960]   - Oh, wow.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.680]   - So that is a close call, but people have studied it
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.640]   and then apparently are very confident
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.400]   it's not actually going to hit us, but it wasn't.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.400]   - I'm gonna have to look into this
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.240]   'cause I'm very sure, I'm very sure
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.560]   what's gonna happen if an asteroid actually hits earth
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:17.040]   that the scientific community and government
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:23.360]   will confidently say that we have nothing to worry about.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.240]   It's going to be a close call.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:28.120]   And then last minute, they'll be like,
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.280]   there was a miscalculation.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280]   They're not lying.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.040]   It's just like the space of possibilities
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.480]   'cause it's very difficult to track these kinds of things.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.840]   And there's a lot of kind of,
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.400]   there's complexities involved to this.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.960]   There's a lot of uncertainties.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:44.360]   That I just, something tells me
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.440]   that human civilization will end with,
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.400]   we'll see it coming.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.600]   And then last minute there'll be a oops.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.480]   Well, like we'll see it coming and we'll be like,
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.320]   no, this is threatening, but no problem, no problem.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.720]   And last minute it'll be like, oops,
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.000]   that was a miscalculation.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.720]   And then it's all over in a matter of like a week.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.840]   - But is there, (laughs)
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.320]   we're just very positive and optimistic today.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.560]   Is there any chance that Bruce Willis can save us?
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.240]   In the sense that from what you know about asteroids,
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:22.240]   is there something that you can catch them early enough
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.440]   to change volcanic eruptions, right?
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:31.680]   Sort of drill, put a nuclear weapon inside
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:35.300]   and break up the asteroid or change its trajectory?
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.860]   - There is potential for that.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.980]   If you catch it early enough in advance,
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:48.140]   I think in theory, if you knew five years in advance,
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:55.020]   depending on the objects and how close,
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:57.780]   how much you would need to deflect it,
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:00.700]   you could deflect it a little bit.
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:04.260]   I don't know that it would be sufficient in all cases.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.180]   And this is definitely not my specific area of expertise,
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.220]   but my understanding is that
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.540]   there is something you could do.
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:15.380]   But it also, how you would carry that out
[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.540]   depends a lot on the properties of the asteroid.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:20.160]   If it's a solid object versus a rubble pile.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.380]   So let's say you planted some bomb in the middle of it
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.460]   and it blew up,
[01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.860]   but it was just kind of a pile of material anyway.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.700]   And then that material comes back together
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.300]   and then you kind of just have the same thing.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.220]   Presumably its trajectory would be altered, but it's-
[01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:38.460]   - It's like Terminator 2,
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.420]   when it's like the thing that just like,
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.180]   you shoot it and it splashes and then comes back together.
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.780]   It would be very useless.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.620]   That's fascinating.
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:47.020]   And what's fascinating,
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.660]   I've gotten a lot of hope
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:56.660]   from watching SpaceX rockets that land.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.020]   There's so much, it's like, oh wow,
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.780]   from an AI perspective, from a robotics perspective,
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:07.580]   wow, we can do a hell of an amazing job with control.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:13.500]   But then we have an understanding about surfaces here
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.940]   on earth, we can map up a lot of things.
[01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:18.980]   I wonder if we can do that some kind of detail
[01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:22.900]   of being able to have that same level of precision
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.020]   in landing on surfaces
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:29.020]   with as wide of a variety as asteroids have.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.500]   So be able to understand
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.220]   the exact properties of the surface
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.980]   and be able to encode that
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.740]   into whatever rocket that lands sufficiently to,
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.460]   I presume humans, unlike the movies,
[01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.620]   humans would likely get in the way.
[01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:47.220]   Like it should all be done by robots.
[01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:52.220]   And like land, drill, place the explosive,
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:56.420]   that should all be done through control, through robots.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.820]   And then you should be able to dynamically adjust
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.020]   to the surface.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.220]   The flip side of that for a robotics person,
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.340]   I don't know if you've seen these,
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:07.020]   it's been very heartbreaking.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.940]   Somebody I know well, Russ Tedrick at MIT
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.900]   led the DARPA Robotics Challenge Team
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.540]   for the Humanoid Robot Challenge.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.020]   For DARPA, I don't know if you've seen videos
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.420]   of robots on two feet falling,
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.540]   but you're talking about millions,
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.060]   several years of work
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.780]   with some of the most brilliant roboticists in the world,
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.900]   millions of dollars.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:29.420]   And the final thing is a highlight video on YouTube
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.620]   of robots falling,
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.700]   but they had a lot of trouble with uneven surfaces.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:35.140]   That's basically what you have to do.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.300]   With the challenge involves,
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.500]   you're mostly autonomous
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:41.140]   with some partial human communication,
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.180]   but that human communication is broken up.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:46.020]   Like you don't get a, you get a noisy channel.
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:47.380]   So you can, humans can,
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.740]   which is very similar to what it would be like
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.740]   in humans remotely operating a thing on an asteroid.
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.240]   And so with that, robots really struggle.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:00.940]   There's some hilarious, painful videos of like a robot,
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.220]   not able to like open the door.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.580]   And then it tries to open the door without like,
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.620]   it misses the handle.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.220]   And in doing so like falls.
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.940]   I mean, it's painful to watch.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.540]   So like that, there's that, and then there's SpaceX.
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.740]   So I have hope from SpaceX,
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.200]   and then I have less hope from Bipedal Robotics.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.740]   But it's fun to kind of imagine.
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.980]   And I think the planetary side of it comes into play
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.980]   in understanding the surfaces of these asteroids
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:31.780]   more and more that, you know,
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.460]   forget sort of destruction of human civilization.
[01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.380]   It'd be cool to have like spacecraft
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:40.340]   just landing on all these asteroids to study them at scale
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:43.580]   and being able to figure out dynamically what, you know,
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:48.580]   whether it's a rubble pile or whether it's a solid objects.
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:51.460]   Dick, do you see that kind of future of science,
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.780]   maybe 100, 200, 300 years from now,
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.740]   where there's just robots expanding out
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.620]   through the solar system, like sensors essentially.
[01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:02.320]   Some of it taking pictures from a distance,
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.180]   some of them landing, just exploring and giving us data.
[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.260]   'Cause it feels like we're working
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.860]   with very little data right now.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:14.460]   - Sure, I do see exploration going that way.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:19.460]   I think the way that NASA is currently,
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:23.340]   or historically has been doing missions
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:26.460]   is putting together these really large missions
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.900]   that do a lot of things and are extremely well tested
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.360]   and have a very low rate of failure.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   But now that these sort of CubeSat technologies
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.900]   are becoming easier to build, easier to launch,
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.460]   they're very cheap.
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.820]   And you know, NASA is getting involved in this as well.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:46.900]   There's a lot of interest in these missions
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.380]   that are relatively small, relatively cheap
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.480]   and just do one thing.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:54.140]   So you can really optimize it to just do this one thing
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.660]   and maybe you could build a hundred of them
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:57.140]   and send them to different asteroids.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:59.360]   And they would just collect this one piece of information
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.060]   from each asteroid.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.540]   It's a kind of different,
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:06.320]   more distributed way of doing science, I guess.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.160]   And there's a ton of potential there, I agree.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.780]   - Let me ask you about objects or one particular object
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:17.100]   from outside our solar system.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.580]   We don't get to study many of these, right?
[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:23.260]   We don't get stuff that just flies in out of nowhere
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.860]   from outside the solar system and flies through.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.220]   Apparently there's been two recently in the past few years.
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:32.980]   One of them is Amuamua.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:37.200]   What are your thoughts about Amuamua?
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.180]   So fun to say.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:42.940]   Could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.900]   or is this just a weird shaped comet?
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.440]   - I like the way that's phrased.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.480]   So Amuamua is a fascinating object.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.300]   Just the fact that we have started discovering things
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.640]   that are coming in from outside our solar system is amazing
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.960]   and can start to study them.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.760]   And now that we have seen some,
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:08.760]   we can design now kind of thinking in advance.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.980]   The next time we see one, we will be much more ready for it.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.100]   We will know which telescopes we want to point at it.
[01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:16.540]   We will have explored whether we could even
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.140]   launch a fast turnaround mission to actually like get to it
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.100]   before it leaves the solar system.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.280]   In terms of Amuamua, yeah,
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:28.300]   for an object in our solar system,
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.740]   it's really unusual in two particular ways.
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:37.020]   One is the dimensions that we don't see natural things
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:40.460]   in our solar system that are kind of long and skinny.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.700]   The things we see in our solar system
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:45.180]   don't deviate from spherical by that much.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:48.420]   And then that it showed these strange properties
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.060]   of accelerating as it was leaving the solar system,
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.220]   which was not understood at first.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:58.220]   So in terms of the alien space junk,
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:03.220]   you know, as a scientist, I cannot rule out that possibility.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:05.500]   I have no evidence to the contrary.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.980]   However--
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.620]   - So you're saying there's a chance.
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:14.100]   - I cannot, as a scientist, honestly say
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:17.340]   that I can rule out that it's alien space junk.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:22.340]   However, I see the kind of alien explanation
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.340]   as following this, the Sagan's extraordinary claims
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:29.080]   require extraordinary evidence.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:33.780]   If you are going to actually claim that something is aliens,
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:37.140]   you need to carefully evaluate,
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.900]   one needs to carefully evaluate the other options
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.300]   and see whether it could just be something
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.140]   that we know exists that makes sense.
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:46.660]   In the case of a muamua,
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.580]   there are explanations that fit well
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.340]   within our understanding of how things work.
[01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:58.100]   So there are a couple, there are two hypotheses
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.220]   for what it could be made of.
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.080]   They're both basically just ice shards.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.060]   In one case, it's a nitrogen ice shard
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.580]   that came off of something like Pluto
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.380]   in another solar system.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.640]   That Pluto got hit with something and broke up into pieces.
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:13.220]   And one of those pieces came through our solar system.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.220]   In the other scenario, it's a bit of a failed solar system.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:21.100]   So our solar system formed out
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.340]   of a collapsing molecular cloud.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.940]   Sometimes those molecular clouds are not massive enough
[01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.620]   and they sort of collapse into bits,
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.460]   but they don't actually form a solar system,
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.180]   but you end up with these kind of chunks
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.980]   of hydrogen ice apparently.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.660]   And so one of those chunks of hydrogen ice
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:39.700]   could have got ejected and passed through our solar system.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:44.220]   So both cases explain these properties
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.600]   in about the same way.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.780]   So those ices will sublimate once they've passed the sun.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:51.380]   And so as they're moving away from the sun,
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:53.880]   you have the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:55.820]   off the sunward part of it.
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.820]   And so that is responsible for the acceleration.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:01.860]   The shape also, because you have all this ice
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.160]   sublimating off the surface,
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.500]   if you take something,
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:09.700]   the analogy that works pretty well here
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.100]   is for a bar of soap.
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.300]   Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical,
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.740]   at least from a physicist's perspective.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.580]   And as you use it over time,
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.180]   you eventually end up with this long thin shard
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.340]   because it's been just by sort of weathering,
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:25.340]   as we would call it.
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:28.860]   And so in the same way,
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.660]   if you just sublimate material
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.260]   off of one of these ice shards,
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.000]   it ends up long and thin
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.900]   and it ends up accelerating out of the solar system.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:38.380]   And so given that these properties
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.480]   can be reasonably well explained that way,
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:45.260]   we should be extremely skeptical
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:48.940]   about attributing things to aliens.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:52.040]   - See, the reason I like to think that it's aliens
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.060]   is because it puts a lot of priority
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:56.100]   on us not being lazy.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.380]   And we need to catch this thing
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.060]   next time it comes around.
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.940]   I like the idea that there's objects,
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:05.080]   not like, it almost saddens me.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.600]   They come out of the darkness really fast
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.700]   and just fly by and go and leave.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:13.420]   It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to study them.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:18.000]   It's like, it's the easiest way
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.680]   to do space travel outside of the solar system,
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.200]   is having the things come to us, right?
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.440]   - I like that way of putting it.
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.560]   - And it would be nice to just land on it.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:31.060]   And first of all, really importantly,
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:34.280]   detect it early and then land on it
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:40.960]   with a really nice spacecraft and study the hell out of it.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:50.840]   If there's a chance it's aliens, alien life,
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.920]   it just feels like such a cheap way, inexpensive way
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:00.660]   to get information about alien life
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:03.080]   or something interesting that's out there.
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.380]   And I'm not sure if a nice shard
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:08.120]   from another planetary system will be interesting,
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.480]   but it very well could be.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.400]   It could be totally new sets of materials.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.440]   It could tell us about composition
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.540]   of planets we don't quite understand.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.540]   And it's just nice when,
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.040]   especially in the case of a MoMo,
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.920]   I guess it was pretty close to Earth.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.880]   It would have been nice to, you know,
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.360]   let's say, don't go there, they come to us.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.440]   I don't know.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.380]   That's what makes me quite a sad.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.180]   It's a missed opportunity.
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:34.020]   - Well, yeah.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:36.380]   And whether you think it's aliens or not,
[01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.820]   it's a missed opportunity, but, you know,
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.700]   we weren't prepared and we will be prepared
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:41.780]   for the next ones.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.660]   And as so there's been a movement in astronomy
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:49.080]   more towards what's called time domain astronomy.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.120]   So kind of monitoring the whole sky all the time
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.860]   at all wavelengths, that's kind of the goal.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:57.280]   And so we expect to detect many more of these in the future,
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.340]   even though these were the first two we saw,
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:01.980]   our potential to detect them is only increasing with time.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:04.560]   And so there will be more opportunities.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.860]   And, you know, based on these two,
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:10.360]   we now can actually sit and think about what we'll do
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:11.860]   when the next one shows up.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   - I also, what it made me realize,
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.900]   I know I didn't really think through this,
[01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.860]   but it made me realize
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:20.520]   if there is alien civilizations out there,
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.940]   the thing we're most likely to see first
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.520]   would be space junk.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:28.220]   My stupid understanding of it.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.060]   And the second would be really dumb kind of,
[01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:35.640]   you could think of maybe like relay nodes or something,
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.220]   objects that you need to have a whole lot of
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:44.120]   for particular purposes of like space travel and so on,
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.500]   like speed limit signs or something, I don't know,
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.940]   whatever we have on earth, a lot of, that's dumb.
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:52.500]   It's not aliens in themselves.
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:56.240]   It's like artifacts that are useful to the engineering
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:59.200]   in the systems that are engineered by alien civilizations.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:03.920]   So like, we would see a lot of stuff.
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.280]   In terms of SETI, in terms of looking for alien life
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.760]   and trying to communicate with it,
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.760]   maybe we should be looking not for like smart creatures
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.280]   or systems to communicate with.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.840]   Maybe we should be looking for artifacts
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.000]   or even as dumb as like space junk.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.980]   It just kind of reframed my perspective of like,
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.980]   what are we looking for as signs?
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.740]   'Cause there could be a lot of stuff
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.060]   that doesn't have intelligence
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.620]   but gives us really strong signs
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.640]   that there's somewhere is life or intelligent life.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:40.780]   And yeah, that made me kind of,
[01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:42.980]   I know it might be dumb to say it,
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:46.140]   but reframe the kind of thing that we should be looking for.
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:50.380]   - Yeah, it's, so the benefit of looking
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.380]   for intelligent life is that we perhaps
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:54.500]   have a better chance of recognizing it.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.220]   - Yeah. - We couldn't necessarily
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.580]   recognize what an alien stop sign looked like.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.380]   - That's true. - And maybe,
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:05.080]   the theorists or the people who sort of model
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.620]   and try to understand solar system objects
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.220]   are pretty good at coming up with models for anything.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.780]   I mean, maybe a muamua was a stop sign,
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.580]   but we're clever enough that we could come up
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.140]   with some physical explanations for it.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:21.340]   And then, we all wanna go with the simplest possible,
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:24.500]   we all wanna believe the sort of most skeptical
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.540]   possible explanation.
[01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.260]   And so we missed it because we're too good
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:30.100]   at coming up with alternate explanations for things.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:32.660]   - And it's such an outlier, such a rare phenomenon
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.660]   that we can't study 100 or a thousand of these objects.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.100]   We have to, we had just one.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.260]   And so the science almost destroys the possibility
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.740]   of something special being there.
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.820]   It's like a Johnny Ive, this designer of Apple,
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.340]   I don't know if you know who that is.
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:49.380]   He's the lead designer.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.660]   He's the person who designed the iPhone
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:53.580]   and all the major things.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.740]   And he talked about, he's brilliant,
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.580]   one of my favorite humans on earth
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:01.120]   and one of the best designers in the history of earth.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:05.460]   He talked about like when he had this origins of an idea,
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.660]   like in his baby stages, he would not tell Steve Jobs
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:11.820]   because Steve would usually like trample all over it.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.980]   He would say, "This is a dumb idea."
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:16.020]   And so I sometimes think of the scientific community
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:21.020]   in that sense because the weapon of the scientific method
[01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:26.060]   is so strong at its best that it sometimes crushes
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:30.300]   the out of the box outlier evidence.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:32.400]   You know, we don't get a lot of that evidence
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.880]   'cause we don't have, we're not lucky enough
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.880]   to have a lot of evidence.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:38.740]   So we have to deal with just special cases.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.860]   And special cases could present an inkling
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:44.420]   of something much bigger.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.780]   But the scientific method user tramples all over it.
[01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:49.180]   And it's hard to know what to do with that
[01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:52.080]   because the scientific method works.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.860]   But at the same time, every once in a while,
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:55.180]   it's like a balance.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.960]   You have to do 99% of the time,
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.660]   you have to do like scientific rigor.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.620]   But every once in a while, this is not you saying,
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:05.940]   me saying, smoke some weed and sit back and think,
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.200]   "I wonder," you know, it's the Joe Rogan thing.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.540]   It's entirely possible that it's alien space junk.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:15.300]   Anyway.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   - Yeah, I think, so I completely agree.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:21.460]   And I think that most scientists
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:23.460]   do speculate about these things.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:27.120]   It's just, at what point do you act on those things?
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.620]   So you're right that the scientific method
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.900]   has inherent skepticism.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:35.500]   And for the most part, that's a good thing
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:38.320]   because it means that we're not just believing
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.200]   crazy things all the time.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:45.020]   But it's an interesting point
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:49.140]   that requiring that high level of rigor
[01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.340]   occasionally means that you will miss something
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.180]   that is truly interesting
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:57.260]   because you needed to verify it three times
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.700]   and it wasn't verifiable.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.380]   - I also think like when you communicate
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.440]   with the general public,
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.220]   I think there's power in that 1% speculation
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:09.980]   of just demonstrating authenticity as a human being,
[01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:11.340]   as a curious human being.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:15.740]   I think too often, I think this is changing,
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:19.740]   but I saw, I've been quite disappointed in my colleagues
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.980]   throughout 2020 with the coronavirus.
[01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:25.100]   There's too much speaking from authority
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:28.840]   as opposed to speaking from curiosity.
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.380]   There's some of the most incredible science
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.740]   that's been done in 2020,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.580]   especially on the virology, biology side.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.540]   And the kind of being talked down to by scientists
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.420]   is always really disappointing to me
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:43.300]   as opposed to inspiring.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:44.260]   Like the things we,
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.940]   there's a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus,
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.780]   but we know a lot of stuff.
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:52.180]   And we speak from scientists from various disciplines,
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:56.160]   speak from data in the face of that uncertainty.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.660]   And we're curious, we don't know what the hell is going on.
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:02.580]   We don't know if this virus is going to evolve, mutate.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:05.100]   We don't know if this virus or the next one
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.740]   might destroy all of human civilization.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:08.900]   You can't speak with certain,
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:13.560]   in fact, I was on a survey paper about masks.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.060]   Something I don't talk much about
[01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.060]   'cause I don't like politics,
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.940]   but we don't know if masks work,
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.140]   but there's a lot of evidence to show that they work
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.100]   for this particular virus.
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.820]   The transmission of the virus is fascinating actually.
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:31.820]   The biomechanics of the way viruses spread is fascinating.
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:36.100]   If it wasn't destructive, it would be beautiful.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:36.980]   And we don't know,
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:40.580]   but it's inspiring to apply the scientific method
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:42.080]   to the best of our ability,
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.900]   but also to show that you don't always know everything
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.760]   and to, perhaps not about the virus as much,
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.840]   but other things speculate.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.680]   What if?
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:56.140]   What if it's the worst case and the best case?
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.700]   Because that's ultimately what we are,
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.300]   descendants of apes that are just curious
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.300]   about the world around us.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.860]   - Yeah, I'll just add to that,
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:08.100]   not on the topic of masks, but on the topic of curiosity.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:13.100]   That's, I mean, I think that's,
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:18.580]   astronomy and planetary sciences field are a little,
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:21.940]   are unique because for better and for worse,
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:24.980]   they don't directly impact humanity.
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:31.100]   So, we're not studying virology to prevent transmission
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:35.380]   of illness amongst humans.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.700]   We're not characterizing volcanoes on earth
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.500]   that could destroy cities.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:45.380]   And it really is a more curious and in my opinion,
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:47.840]   playful scientific field than many.
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.740]   So, for better and worse,
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:53.900]   we can kind of afford to pursue some of the speculation more
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.780]   because human lives are not in danger
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.300]   if we speculate a little bit too freely
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.020]   and get something wrong.
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.220]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:05.500]   In the space of AI, I am worried
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.940]   that we're sometimes too eager, speaking for myself,
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.780]   to flip the switch to on just to see what happens.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.700]   Maybe sometimes we wanna be a little bit careful about that
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:19.640]   'cause bad things might happen.
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:25.300]   Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently
[01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:28.800]   that were inspiring, had an impact on you
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.380]   that you would recommend?
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:31.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.640]   So many that I just don't know where to start with it.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.220]   So, I love reading.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.380]   I read obsessively.
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:41.660]   I've been reading fiction and a little bit of nonfiction,
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:45.300]   but mostly fiction obsessively since I was a child
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:46.460]   and just never stopped.
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:50.080]   So, I have some favorite books.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.780]   None of them are easy readings.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.700]   So, I definitely, I mean, I recommend them for somebody
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:56.660]   who likes an intellectual challenge
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.060]   in the books that they read.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.940]   So, maybe I should go chronologically.
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.340]   I have at least three.
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:07.860]   I'm not gonna go through 50 here, but.
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.900]   - Yeah, I'd love to also,
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:14.900]   like maybe ideas that you took away from what you mentioned.
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.880]   - Yeah, yeah, why they were so compelling to me.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:23.480]   One of the first books that really captured my fascination
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.380]   was Nabokov's book "Pale Fire."
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.540]   - Oh, wow.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.140]   - Are you familiar with it?
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:34.140]   - So, I read it actually for a class.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.520]   It's one of the few books I've ever read for a class
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.920]   that I actually really liked.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:44.360]   And the book is, it's in some sense a puzzle.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:47.060]   He's a brilliant writer, of course,
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:52.060]   but the book is like, it's formatted like a poem.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:56.940]   So, there's an introduction, a very long poem and footnotes,
[01:45:56.940 --> 01:46:00.620]   and you get partway through it before realizing
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.140]   that the whole thing is actually a novel,
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.020]   unless you sort of read up on it going in,
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.540]   but the whole thing is a novel,
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:10.420]   and there's a story that slowly reveals itself
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:12.300]   over the course of all of this,
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:19.020]   and kind of reveals this just fascinating character,
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:23.960]   basically, and how his mind works in this story.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.200]   The idea of a novel also being a kind of intellectual puzzle
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.100]   and something that slowly reveals itself
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.060]   over the course of reading was really fascinating to me,
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.360]   and I have since found a lot more writers like that.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:43.260]   Contemporary example that comes to mind is Kazuo Ishiguro,
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.620]   who's pretty much all of his books are slow reveals
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.600]   over the course of the book,
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.200]   and nothing much happens in the books,
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.340]   but you keep reading them because you just wanna know
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.640]   what the reality is that he's slowly revealing to you,
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:00.300]   the kind of discovery-oriented reading, maybe.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.720]   - What's the second one?
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:08.720]   - Perhaps my favorite writer is Renier Maria Rilke.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:09.880]   - Wow.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:13.060]   - Are you familiar with him? - No, also not familiar.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.900]   You're hitting the ones, I mean, I know in the book of well,
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:19.500]   but I've never read "Pale Fire," but Rilke, I've never,
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.580]   I know it's a very difficult read, I know that much.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:25.260]   - Yeah, right, all of these are difficult reads.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:30.260]   I think I just, I read in part for an intellectual challenge
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:34.580]   but Rilke, so he wrote one thing
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:36.760]   that might be characterizable as a novel,
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.740]   but he wrote a lot of poetry.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.600]   I mean, he wrote this series of poems
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   called "The Duino Elegies" that were very impactful for me
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.580]   personally, just emotionally,
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:53.100]   which actually, it kind of ties in with astronomy
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:57.780]   in that there's a sense,
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:01.420]   in which we're all going through our lives alone
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.200]   and there's just this sense of kind of profound loneliness
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.140]   in the existence of every individual human.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:13.840]   And I think I was drawn to astronomy in part
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.560]   because the sort of vast spaces,
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.420]   the kind of loneliness and desolateness of space
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:24.560]   made the sort of internal loneliness feel okay,
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.740]   in a sense, it like gave companionship.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:32.100]   That's how I feel about Rilke's poetry.
[01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:37.100]   He turns the kind of desolation and loneliness
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:40.840]   of human existence into something joyful
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.180]   and almost meaningful.
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:45.900]   - Yeah, there's something about melancholy,
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.200]   I don't know about Rilke in general,
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.200]   but like contemplating the melancholy nature
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:58.700]   of the human condition that makes it okay.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:03.580]   Like I tend to, from an engineering perspective,
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:05.880]   think that there is so much loneliness
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.860]   we haven't explored within ourselves yet.
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:12.020]   And that's my hope is to build AI systems
[01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:14.520]   that help us explore our own loneliness.
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.520]   I think that's kind of what love is and friendship is,
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.780]   is somebody who in a very small way
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:24.080]   helps us explore our own loneliness.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:28.540]   Like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:31.060]   connect for a time and it's like,
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:34.800]   oh, like acknowledge that we exist together
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.380]   like for a brief time.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:39.440]   But in a somewhat shallow way,
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:42.300]   I think relative to how much it's possible
[01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:44.440]   to truly connect those two consciousnesses.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:48.920]   So AI might be able to help on that front.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.000]   So what's the third one?
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.760]   - Actually, I hadn't realized until this moment,
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:56.960]   but it's yet another one of these kind of slow reveal books.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.960]   It's a contemporary Russian,
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.280]   I think Russian American writer named Olga Grushin,
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:05.400]   G-R-U-S-H-I-N.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.880]   And she wrote this just phenomenal book
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:10.280]   called "The Dream Life of Sukhonov"
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.480]   that I read this year,
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:14.720]   maybe it was last year for the first time.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.940]   And it's just a really beautiful,
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:20.900]   this one you could call a character study, I think,
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:26.160]   of a Russian father coming to terms with himself
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.480]   and his own past
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:32.680]   as he potentially slowly loses his mind.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.280]   - Slow reveal.
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:37.720]   Slow reveal of love.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.760]   - Well, that's apparent from the beginning.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.660]   I hope I don't think it's a spoiler.
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:43.300]   (laughs)
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:46.100]   - Declining to madness, spoiler alert.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.540]   - So all of these are really heavy.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.620]   I don't know, I just,
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.580]   I don't have anything lighter to recommend.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.740]   Ishiguro's the light version of this.
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:53.580]   - Okay.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.820]   (laughs)
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.540]   Oh, well, heavy has a certain kind of beauty to it
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:58.380]   in itself.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.860]   Is there advice you would give to a young person today
[01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:03.060]   that looks up to the stars
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.020]   and wonders what the heck they wanna do with their life?
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.060]   So career, science, life in general,
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:13.420]   you've for now chosen a certain kind of path of curiosity.
[01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:17.100]   What insights do you draw from that
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:19.000]   that you can give as advice to others?
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.900]   - I think for somebody,
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:25.260]   I would not presume to speak,
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:29.140]   to giving people advice on life and humanity overall,
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:33.660]   but for somebody thinking of being a scientist.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:35.740]   So there are a couple of things,
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.740]   one sort of practical thing,
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:40.100]   which is career-wise,
[01:51:40.100 --> 01:51:42.260]   I hadn't appreciated this going into science,
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:44.340]   but you need to,
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:48.240]   so the questions you're working on
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.660]   and the techniques you use
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:54.320]   are both of very high importance,
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:57.060]   maybe equal importance for being happy in your career.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:59.620]   If there are questions you're interested in,
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:03.100]   but the techniques that you need to use to do them
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.460]   are tedious for you,
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:06.620]   then your job is gonna be miserable,
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.980]   even if the questions are inspiring.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:11.340]   So you have to find,
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:13.060]   but if the techniques that you use
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.800]   are things that excite you,
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.620]   then your job is fun every day.
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.060]   So for me, I'm fascinated by the solar system
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.300]   and I love telescopes
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.660]   and I love doing data analysis,
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.020]   playing with data from telescopes,
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:25.740]   coming up with new ways to use telescopes,
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:28.040]   and so that's where I have found that mesh.
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:30.660]   But if I was interested in
[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:32.660]   the dynamical evolution of the solar system,
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:34.020]   how the orbits of things evolve,
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:36.700]   then I would need to do a different type of work
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.340]   that I would just not find as appealing
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:39.740]   and so it just wouldn't be a good fit.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:41.820]   And so it's sort of is,
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:43.380]   seems like an unromantic thing
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.120]   to have to think about the techniques
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.560]   being the thing you wanna work on also,
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.260]   but it really makes a profound difference
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:52.380]   for I think your happiness in your scientific career.
[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:53.540]   - I think that's really profound.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.260]   It's like the thing, the menial tasks.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:58.060]   If you enjoy those, that's a really good sign
[01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:00.540]   that that's the right path for you.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:02.860]   I think David Foster Wallace said that
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.700]   the key to life is to be unboreable.
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:09.820]   So basically everything should be exciting.
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:11.640]   I don't think that's feasible,
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:15.300]   but you should find an area where everything is exciting.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.460]   I mean, depending on the day,
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.360]   but you could find the joy in everything,
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:21.700]   not just the big exciting, quote unquote,
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:23.620]   things that everyone thinks is exciting,
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:28.620]   but the details, the repetitive stuff,
[01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:30.980]   the menial stuff, the stuff that takes years,
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:32.980]   the stuff that involves a lot of failure
[01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:33.980]   and all those kinds of things,
[01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:35.380]   and you find that enjoyable.
[01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:37.740]   That's actually really profound to focus on that
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:42.060]   'cause people talk about like dreams and passion and goals
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.180]   and so on, the big thing,
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.540]   but that's not actually what takes you there.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:48.100]   It takes you there every single day, putting in the hours,
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:51.900]   and that's what actually makes up life is the boring bits.
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.060]   And if the boring bits aren't boring,
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.500]   then that's an exciting life.
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:54:01.340]   - Let me, 'cause when you were talking so romantically
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.620]   and passionately about "I/O",
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:06.340]   I remember the poem by Robert Frost.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.860]   So let me ask you, let me read the poem
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:11.380]   and ask what your opinion is.
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:12.860]   It's called "Fire and Ice".
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:16.220]   - Oh yeah, I could almost recite this from memory.
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:19.420]   - Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.980]   From what I've tasted of desire,
[01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.380]   I hold with those who favor fire.
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:25.860]   But if I had to perish twice,
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.180]   I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction,
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:32.860]   ice is also great and will suffice.
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:37.860]   So let me ask, if you had to only choose one,
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:41.280]   would you choose the world to end in fire,
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:46.280]   in volcanic eruptions, in heat and magma,
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:49.380]   or in ice frozen over?
[01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:51.820]   Fire or ice?
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:52.660]   - Fire.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:55.340]   (laughing)
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.060]   - Excellent choice.
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:58.420]   - It's just the sort of,
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:02.300]   I've always been a fan of chaos
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:07.300]   and the idea of things just slowly getting cold
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:14.580]   and stopping and dying is just so depressing to me.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.260]   So much more depressing than things blowing up
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.180]   or burning and getting covered by a lava flow.
[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.180]   Somehow the activity of it endows it
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:27.580]   with more meaning to me, maybe.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.260]   - I've just now had this vision of you,
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:31.620]   you know, in action films where you're walking away
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:34.460]   without looking back and there's explosions behind you
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.540]   and you put on shades and then it goes to credits.
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:40.380]   So, Katherine, this was awesome.
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:43.440]   I think your work is really inspiring.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:48.260]   The kind of things we'll discover about planets
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:50.300]   in the next few decades is super cool
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:53.900]   and I hope, I know you said there's probably not life
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:55.540]   in one of them, but there might be.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:58.020]   And I hope we discover just that.
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.980]   And perhaps even on Io, within the volcanic eruptions,
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:04.580]   there's a little creature hanging on
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:06.220]   that we'll one day discover.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:08.460]   Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:09.300]   with me today.
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.580]   It was really awesome.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:11.500]   - Yeah, likewise.
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.060]   Thank you for having me here.
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:15.700]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:16.940]   with Katherine DeCleer.
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:21.260]   And thank you to Fundrise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:23.060]   and Magic Spoon.

[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.580]   And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.220]   "On Titan, the molecules that have been raining down
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:35.860]   like mana from heaven for the last four billion years
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:40.020]   might still be there, largely unaltered, deep frozen,
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:42.660]   awaiting for the chemists from Earth."
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:45.340]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:50.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:56:50.540 --> 01:57:00.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
