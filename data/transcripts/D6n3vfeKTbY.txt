[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.840]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.240]   Duncan, we've got a lot more questions
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.280]   beyond the bond market today.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   Stock market, inflation,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   people are thinking about other stuff.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.720]   I'm excited, we've got a great guest today,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480]   so let's do it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.480]   Yeah, we've got a good one.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.080]   Let's not waste any time.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.960]   All right, right on.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320]   All right, so up first today we have,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   I'm 29 and planning to work until age 67 or so.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.440]   I've read the equities return about 10% on average,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.560]   but what real rate of return should I be using
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.360]   for retirement forecasting?
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   Okay, something that maybe some non-finance people
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.960]   don't know, real means inflation adjusted.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640]   I like the fact that this person is thinking that way,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000]   especially for 29.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   By the time you're 67, retirement planning,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760]   that the dollars of today are not gonna be
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.720]   what the dollars of tomorrow are worth.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   And I think a lot of people don't understand this
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   sometimes, right?
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.960]   Like, we were talking about GDP today on social media,
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.800]   and the government reports real GDP,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.440]   which is inflation adjusted.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.360]   And a lot of people my Twitter mentions don't realize
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   that real means inflation adjusted.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.480]   Right.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.160]   Well, sure, GDP is up, but what about after inflation?
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.760]   Well, real GDP is after inflation.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.360]   That does kind of seem like the catch-all return
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760]   or retort that you get a lot,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.680]   anytime you give any numbers as people go,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   but what about inflation?
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.760]   Yes, and I think more people are thinking about
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.320]   real stock market returns, inflation adjusted now,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.000]   than they would have in the 2010s when it was lower,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.760]   even though inflation was still eating your returns.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.960]   So let's actually bring on someone who has studied
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.800]   long-term returns for the U.S. stock market
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.160]   even more than I have, which is saying something.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   That's a lot.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.400]   Mr. Jeremy Schwartz from Wisdom Tree.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.240]   Jeremy.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   Hey, Jeremy.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160]   Ben Duncan, great to be here with you guys.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.360]   I have my copy of "Stocks to the Long Run"
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.200]   that you gave me.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.280]   I think this is a sixth edition.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   You've worked with Professor Siegel on what,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   three or four editions of the book,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.440]   researching, writing this.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880]   You guys have looked at stock market returns
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080]   from every angle in this book.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   So if we're just looking backwards,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.320]   we're not looking forward there.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.640]   If we're looking backwards, what do you got for us
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.040]   in terms of the real returns for the U.S. stock market
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.960]   over the long run?
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   It is a great question, and it's a great question
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   with inflation being like the prime consideration
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.280]   for everybody today, is people are really worried.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.320]   How do you protect from inflation?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.560]   And we often say, you know,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.600]   stocks are not just a good inflation hedge,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.940]   they're really the best long-term inflation hedge.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000]   When you look at companies' pricing power,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.080]   you see it in earnings reports all the time now,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   maybe volumes are flat, but revenue is up
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.000]   because they're raising prices.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.260]   So, you know, you see it, stocks do have pricing power,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.160]   there are claims on real assets,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.360]   companies have plants, asset equipment,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.520]   and that over time protects from inflation.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   Now, we have a chart, I think Duncan and John,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.160]   we have the long-term real returns.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.480]   This is like the central figure from "Stocks to the Long Run."
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.200]   Siegel's first edition came out in '94.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860]   I started with him when I was an undergrad at Wharton,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.020]   and I helped him on the 2002 edition,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.180]   which was the third edition.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.020]   - So you were working on it when you were in college.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.820]   - I started as my sophomore summer, and I never left.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.340]   It's been a 22, 23--
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.980]   - So you're showing us here the real returns,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.000]   again, inflation adjusted for stocks, bonds,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.840]   bills, which is basically T-bills, cash, gold,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.220]   and the dollar, which the dollar is the one people use
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.060]   to scare people usually, which Barry had a great
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.340]   blog post this week saying, listen,
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.880]   dollars are for saving, or investing and spending,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.720]   not saving.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760]   You don't wanna keep your dollar, your money on your dollar.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.040]   You don't wanna bury it in your backyard.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.240]   You should put it into something and invest it.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   So you're showing 6.8% real for stocks,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   three and a half real for bonds,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   two and a half real for cash, 0.6% real for gold,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.480]   and the dollar loses a little over one and a half,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.920]   a little less than one and a half percent over the long term.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   And you guys have this data going back
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.760]   almost more than 200 years, actually.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.080]   - Right, and so Siegel had accumulated
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.360]   the longest time series.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.300]   You often hear of the Ibbotson time period.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.580]   It came from 1926, last 100 years.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.460]   Siegel combined a number of series.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.140]   There's 1871, there was data from the Coles Foundation
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.420]   at Yale collected some data, and Siegel collected
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.740]   some other stuff from 1802 to 1870.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.100]   I mean, what's interesting, that chart of the dollar
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.260]   losing 25 times its purchasing power,
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.460]   that's the measure of inflation over very long periods.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.940]   But you see it was pretty stable until like the 1940s,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.500]   and then you have about 3% inflation over time.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.080]   So, you know, you had 1% back all the way,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.300]   but there was really no loss in the dollar.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.860]   - Right, and inflation is still a relatively new phenomenon.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.180]   - Generally, yeah.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.020]   - It is.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.780]   - And, you know, you had the '70s and '80s,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.260]   which it was very high inflation.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.460]   We can talk about the issues of what the '70s and '80s were,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.980]   how it corresponded to the pandemic and what we did there.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.620]   But, you know, what's fascinating about that chart
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.260]   is you say you had all that inflation,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.500]   went from no inflation to 3% inflation.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.740]   Stocks had the same return pre and post-inflation.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.220]   They didn't actually go down in real returns.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.740]   They had the same return.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.540]   Bonds don't have that same consistency.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.780]   I mean, there was a 35-year period where bonds were negative.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780]   - Well, I looked at, so DeMotorin has data
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.820]   going back to 1928, and so I checked his data to years,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.460]   and the stock market returns real,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.260]   so this is 1928 to 2022, stocks real were 6.6%,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.220]   and bonds were 1.5%, and cash was more like 0.2%.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260]   So in the more recent data,
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.420]   the stock market, you're right, has been similar.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.980]   It's bonds and cash that were a little lower,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.020]   and I'm guessing because of,
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.060]   part of that is the inflationary period
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.620]   that we had for like 30 years.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.540]   The interesting point you make,
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.020]   that stocks are like your best bet
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.900]   for inflation hedging over the long run,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.020]   it can be kind of confusing
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.540]   because we've seen inflation over the short run
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.420]   can ding stocks as it has, right?
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.300]   Rising inflation and rising rates
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740]   can be bad for stocks in the short run,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.860]   but it's still by far your best bet
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.260]   for beating inflation over the long run,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.740]   and that's the thing that matters.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.300]   - Really long run, yes.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.820]   You know, when the Fed starts tightening
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.300]   and raising interest rates,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.780]   there's some fear, there's some sell-off,
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.620]   but the companies have the pricing power.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.620]   Earnings and dividends grow.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.460]   You know, I've got a chart
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.900]   and some of my other decks that show
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.700]   the dividend growth for the last seven years
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.340]   has been 2% above inflation.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.180]   It shows some things where companies grow pricing power
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.700]   with that inflation.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.860]   You know, now what's interesting,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.100]   bond returns today, so people have asked me,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.020]   should we be writing the book "Bonds for the Long Run,"
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   and you mentioned you're getting all these questions
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.620]   on your show about bonds now.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.460]   You know, if you go to the history,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.380]   you see that long-term return was 3.5% for bonds.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.220]   You go back two years ago, the TIPS yields,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.060]   what you have today
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.340]   that you didn't have throughout history
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.820]   is you have inflation-protected securities.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.020]   TIPS yields are a real yield.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.340]   - Right, those are relatively new, too.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.980]   What, '96 or '97 or something? - '97.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.100]   1997 is when they first came out.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.700]   They first came out around 3%.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.340]   They got up as high as 4% in the boom of 2000,
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.620]   and that was a great time to buy TIPS.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.700]   When the S&PP was 30 and you had a 4% TIPS yield.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.300]   You know, you got to negative 1.5%.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.140]   It was crazy.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.780]   People were giving the government $100
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.820]   and getting 90 cents on the dollar 10 years later
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.740]   of purchasing power.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.940]   Like, after inflation purchasing power,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.860]   they're giving the government 100,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.460]   taking back $90 late, you know, 10 years later.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.500]   - Right, it's a very unique asset now
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.940]   that you didn't have in the past.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.700]   So, all we have to go on is historical numbers, right?
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580]   You can use, you can create probabilities based on history,
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.460]   but the thing that people probably care about most
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.300]   is like, okay,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.220]   how do we make reasonable assumptions going forward?
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.740]   So, Duncan, let's go into the next question
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   because that's the real question is,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   okay, we have the historical data,
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.980]   but what about going forward?
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.900]   So, Duncan, do the next one.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500]   - Okay, and that question was from Alex, by the way.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   So, this is from Jeff.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.700]   Can U.S. stocks keep up the same pace
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.920]   of 8% to 10% annual returns over the long run?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.580]   And then you have here a tweet from Sam Parr.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.420]   - Yeah, so a bunch of people actually sent us this.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.260]   So, Sam Parr said,
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.620]   I believe American markets over the next 100 years
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.260]   will most look like the last 100 years,
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.700]   meaning 8% per year.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.780]   He's saying, I don't have too much data.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.740]   He's basically trying to figure out,
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.140]   can what just happened in the last 100 years
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.460]   happen over the next 100 years?
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.340]   And I think a lot of people,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.700]   prognosticators about the U.S. stock market
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.440]   have kind of said, well, yes, we've done so this far.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.460]   John, do a chart on here
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.340]   of the world equity markets that I have.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.020]   So, this just shows, in 1900,
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.620]   the U.S. made up 15% of global equity markets
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.900]   by market capitalization.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.680]   Today, it's more like 60%.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.460]   I always say it looks kind of like Pac-Man
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.860]   eating the rest of the world.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.060]   And so, a lot of people say, well, yeah, that's fine.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.360]   Winners write the history books.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.780]   The U.S. has been great,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.900]   but can it keep that up when valuations are now higher
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.080]   and more people know about it?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.620]   So, how do you think about this, Jeremy?
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.960]   I mean, we know the long-term drivers.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.100]   It's fundamentals like earnings and cash flows
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.980]   and revenue and all these things.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.940]   How do you think about real returns going forward
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.680]   and whether the U.S. can actually duplicate that
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.620]   or at least give investors pretty good returns?
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.220]   I don't know, anything four, five, 6% real
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.980]   over the next, call it two, three decades.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.740]   - Yeah, I have a few charts to help make that point.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.100]   And one is a very simple fundamental relationship,
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.820]   and then we can get into some details.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.820]   My chart dunking on P/E ratios from 1960 to 2023,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.420]   this goes back, there's a fundamental relationship
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.620]   between what you pay and what your return is.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   In bonds, I was getting to that point
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.580]   on the negative tip shields that you had.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.060]   I was gonna say, now the 10-year tip shield
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.340]   is approaching two and a half,
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.160]   maybe you're 240 on the 10-year tips.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.660]   And people generally understand this point better with bonds.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.060]   Hey, your real return on bonds is gonna be very much tied
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.980]   to what is your interest rate that you're getting.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.300]   And so, a valuation bonds is very intuitive
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   to connect to real returns.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.300]   - That's a good point.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.860]   Like, bonds are based on math.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.180]   It's a lot easier to understand.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.760]   The prices are going down, but the yields are going up,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.380]   so you know your expected returns are going higher in bonds.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.100]   - Yep, and so you're getting two and a half percent.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.860]   It's a yield, and you could do the same thing with stocks.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.360]   You know, when we showed the six and a half
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.940]   to seven percent return that stocks had,
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.180]   that's very much because the average P/E ratio
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.960]   over time was 15.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   One divided by 15 is your earnings yield.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.180]   That gets you around that six to seven percent return.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.820]   And so, if you have a higher P/E ratio
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.580]   for the market as a whole,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.460]   that means you're gonna have a lower expected return.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.200]   Now, we think the fair multiple today
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.980]   is probably closer to 20 than 15,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180]   and there's a lot of reasons why.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.260]   You can see this upward-tilted slope P/E.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.060]   You know, you had single-digit P/Es.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.120]   It was in the '70s and '80s
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.500]   when you had double-digit interest rates.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.900]   - So we're looking at an earnings yield now
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.540]   of more like five percent.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.820]   - Yeah, I'd say it's even a little bit higher.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.700]   When I look at the P/Es for next year,
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.340]   you're around 17 to 18 times,
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.780]   so you might be five and a half to six percent P/Es.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.820]   Five and a half to six percent earnings yield,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.740]   so pretty reasonable.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.620]   And that, again, is a real return indicator.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.740]   So you add inflation on top of that.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.100]   So if you think two to three percent inflation,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.720]   you're at seven and a half to nine percent.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.220]   So they're lower than the long-term average of eight to 10.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.500]   We're not gonna say you can do exactly the six, seven
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.620]   that you did before,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.540]   but bonds are 100 basis points lower.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.740]   Stocks are 100 basis points lower.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.460]   So the question is, is the equity premium still alive?
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.780]   You're still getting paid about three percent more
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.020]   for stock risk than bond risk.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.620]   - Which, and that also fluctuates,
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.740]   but that's a good way to look at it.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.500]   Are you still gonna earn a premium
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.860]   over these other risk assets?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.620]   And that, I don't see what would cause
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.120]   that relationship to go away.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.980]   - Well, if you got to a four percent tips yield
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   and the earnings yield on stocks was three,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.820]   you could say, all right,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.300]   now we're gonna get a better deal on bonds,
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.060]   which is what you had in 2000, by the way.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.260]   - Right, and probably what you would have seen
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.020]   in the '80s, too, when P/Es got to eight or seven
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   because inflation was so high.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.380]   That'd be the kind of scenario
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.920]   where it might flip out for a short time, at least.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.420]   - Yeah, perhaps the bond yields spike
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.660]   and you get an opportunity.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.720]   But right now, there's still a three percent cushion,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.900]   even though people say,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.420]   oh, there's so much more competition from bonds.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.140]   You had short-term treasury at five and a half percent.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.300]   That's like apples and oranges
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.100]   because you don't take inflation from that.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.580]   People don't think that five and a half percent
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.180]   is gonna stay forever.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.140]   The tips yields are the right benchmark
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.820]   when you compare stock yields,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.380]   earnings yields on stocks, real assets,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.220]   versus tips yields.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.580]   You see a lot of these charts going around.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.880]   A lot of very smart people on Twitter
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.140]   are doing earnings yields versus the nominal yield,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.660]   and that's just wrong in our view.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.120]   Stocks are more like real assets.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.500]   You gotta compare it to tips yields.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.340]   - Right, okay.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.540]   - Are you saying that we have to update
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.900]   Ben Graham ratios in 2023?
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.740]   - You know, there's all sorts of things.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.180]   - We can't rebuy all the same numbers?
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.580]   - It's a little different today.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.900]   - John, show these long-term real stock market bales.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.740]   I think this is interesting.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.040]   So you look at, you break it out in a different series
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.380]   and different starting points of EPS growth
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.200]   and dividend growth.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.220]   And I think that the dividend growth
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.980]   is the one that I think surprises most people,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.700]   that dividends, not only,
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.460]   dividends themselves are also an inflation hedge, right?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.540]   Because they're growing faster than the rate of inflation.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.300]   So people look at the yield on stocks these days
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.740]   and say, geez, they're way, way lower
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.100]   than they were in the past.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.140]   And part of that is it's still growing over time
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.900]   and growing greater than the rate of inflation,
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.620]   which you don't really get with bonds besides tips.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.540]   And then the other thing is,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.580]   I know you've done work on this too,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.740]   is buybacks are a bigger piece of it now.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.920]   So you have to think of total shareholder yield
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.300]   in terms of paying back debt
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.900]   and buying back stock and EPS growth.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.640]   So maybe you can talk a little bit of these numbers.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.380]   - Yeah, in the first, maybe go to the second row,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.420]   1871 to 1945, amazing how high the dividend yield was
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   in the first 70 years, 5%.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.380]   You know, when we talk about now,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   maybe the forward return is 5%.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.280]   Back in those first 70 years,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.180]   you got all of that just from the dividend yield.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.980]   People treated stocks like bonds
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.340]   and you got these 5% yields.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.860]   - And didn't corporations kind of have to
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.300]   have higher dividend yields to get people off the sidelines
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.820]   and invest in stocks in the first place?
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.980]   Wasn't that the idea?
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.140]   - Yeah, they thought of them very much like bonds.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.940]   You saw no real EPS growth.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.100]   They were paying out, it's almost like a REIT today
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.380]   that pays out all of its earnings, its dividends.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.060]   You saw very high payout ratios.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.660]   Now we're doing more buybacks and we're investing.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.300]   This question is, there's some people who say
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.820]   all that reinvestment is squandered, right?
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.620]   And so that is not what we see in that data.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.860]   Like if you go back to the table for a second,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.300]   what you see is, all right, the payout ratio dropped
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.860]   from the first 70 years to the next 80 years.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.780]   The payout ratios went from 67 to 49.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.780]   It's dropped even more now.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.380]   But what you saw is the earnings growth
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.700]   went up from 70 basis points, 67 basis points
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.740]   in the first column, second row, to 3.5%.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.180]   Earnings growth did go up when people,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.100]   the dividend yield went down by 2%.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.580]   You went from 5.3 dividend yield to 3.3.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.260]   And the earnings growth went up from 70 to 3.4.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.100]   So it's actually even more than the drop in the dividend yield.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.140]   - So allocation by CEOs has actually improved performance
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.740]   of corporations in the last 70 years or whatever.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.940]   - At least it's not dropping off.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.140]   I mean, it's being done one for one to earnings growth.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.380]   It's not just wasted.
