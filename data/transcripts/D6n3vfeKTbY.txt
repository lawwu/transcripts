[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:12.840]   Welcome back to Ask the Compound.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.840]   Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.240]   Duncan, we've got a lot more questions
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.280]   beyond the bond market today.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   Stock market, inflation,
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   people are thinking about other stuff.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.720]   I'm excited, we've got a great guest today,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480]   so let's do it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.480]   Yeah, we've got a good one.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.080]   Let's not waste any time.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.960]   All right, right on.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320]   All right, so up first today we have,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   I'm 29 and planning to work until age 67 or so.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.440]   I've read the equities return about 10% on average,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.560]   but what real rate of return should I be using
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.360]   for retirement forecasting?
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   Okay, something that maybe some non-finance people
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.960]   don't know, real means inflation adjusted.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640]   I like the fact that this person is thinking that way,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.000]   especially for 29.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   By the time you're 67, retirement planning,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760]   that the dollars of today are not gonna be
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.720]   what the dollars of tomorrow are worth.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   And I think a lot of people don't understand this
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   sometimes, right?
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.960]   Like, we were talking about GDP today on social media,
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.800]   and the government reports real GDP,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.440]   which is inflation adjusted.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.360]   And a lot of people my Twitter mentions don't realize
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   that real means inflation adjusted.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.480]   Right.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.160]   Well, sure, GDP is up, but what about after inflation?
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.760]   Well, real GDP is after inflation.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.360]   That does kind of seem like the catch-all return
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.760]   or retort that you get a lot,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.680]   anytime you give any numbers as people go,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.920]   but what about inflation?
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.760]   Yes, and I think more people are thinking about
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.320]   real stock market returns, inflation adjusted now,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.000]   than they would have in the 2010s when it was lower,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.760]   even though inflation was still eating your returns.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.960]   So let's actually bring on someone who has studied
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.800]   long-term returns for the U.S. stock market
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.160]   even more than I have, which is saying something.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   That's a lot.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.400]   Mr. Jeremy Schwartz from Wisdom Tree.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.240]   Jeremy.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   Hey, Jeremy.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160]   Ben Duncan, great to be here with you guys.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   Welcome to the show.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.360]   I have my copy of "Stocks to the Long Run"
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.200]   that you gave me.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.280]   I think this is a sixth edition.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   You've worked with Professor Siegel on what,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.840]   three or four editions of the book,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.440]   researching, writing this.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.880]   You guys have looked at stock market returns
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080]   from every angle in this book.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   So if we're just looking backwards,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.320]   we're not looking forward there.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.640]   If we're looking backwards, what do you got for us
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.040]   in terms of the real returns for the U.S. stock market
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.960]   over the long run?
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   It is a great question, and it's a great question
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.720]   with inflation being like the prime consideration
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.280]   for everybody today, is people are really worried.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.320]   How do you protect from inflation?
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.560]   And we often say, you know,
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.600]   stocks are not just a good inflation hedge,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.940]   they're really the best long-term inflation hedge.
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000]   When you look at companies' pricing power,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.080]   you see it in earnings reports all the time now,
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   maybe volumes are flat, but revenue is up
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.000]   because they're raising prices.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.260]   So, you know, you see it, stocks do have pricing power,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.160]   there are claims on real assets,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.360]   companies have plants, asset equipment,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.520]   and that over time protects from inflation.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.720]   Now, we have a chart, I think Duncan and John,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.160]   we have the long-term real returns.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.480]   This is like the central figure from "Stocks to the Long Run."
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.200]   Siegel's first edition came out in '94.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.860]   I started with him when I was an undergrad at Wharton,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.020]   and I helped him on the 2002 edition,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.180]   which was the third edition.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.020]   - So you were working on it when you were in college.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.820]   - I started as my sophomore summer, and I never left.
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.340]   It's been a 22, 23--
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.980]   - So you're showing us here the real returns,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.000]   again, inflation adjusted for stocks, bonds,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.840]   bills, which is basically T-bills, cash, gold,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.220]   and the dollar, which the dollar is the one people use
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.060]   to scare people usually, which Barry had a great
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.340]   blog post this week saying, listen,
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.880]   dollars are for saving, or investing and spending,
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.720]   not saving.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760]   You don't wanna keep your dollar, your money on your dollar.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.040]   You don't wanna bury it in your backyard.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.240]   You should put it into something and invest it.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.080]   So you're showing 6.8% real for stocks,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   three and a half real for bonds,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   two and a half real for cash, 0.6% real for gold,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.480]   and the dollar loses a little over one and a half,
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.920]   a little less than one and a half percent over the long term.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   And you guys have this data going back
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.760]   almost more than 200 years, actually.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.080]   - Right, and so Siegel had accumulated
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.360]   the longest time series.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.300]   You often hear of the Ibbotson time period.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.580]   It came from 1926, last 100 years.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.460]   Siegel combined a number of series.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.140]   There's 1871, there was data from the Coles Foundation
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.420]   at Yale collected some data, and Siegel collected
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.740]   some other stuff from 1802 to 1870.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.100]   I mean, what's interesting, that chart of the dollar
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.260]   losing 25 times its purchasing power,
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.460]   that's the measure of inflation over very long periods.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.940]   But you see it was pretty stable until like the 1940s,
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.500]   and then you have about 3% inflation over time.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.080]   So, you know, you had 1% back all the way,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.300]   but there was really no loss in the dollar.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.860]   - Right, and inflation is still a relatively new phenomenon.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.180]   - Generally, yeah.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.020]   - It is.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.780]   - And, you know, you had the '70s and '80s,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.260]   which it was very high inflation.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.460]   We can talk about the issues of what the '70s and '80s were,
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.980]   how it corresponded to the pandemic and what we did there.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.620]   But, you know, what's fascinating about that chart
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.260]   is you say you had all that inflation,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.500]   went from no inflation to 3% inflation.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.740]   Stocks had the same return pre and post-inflation.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.220]   They didn't actually go down in real returns.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.740]   They had the same return.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.540]   Bonds don't have that same consistency.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.780]   I mean, there was a 35-year period where bonds were negative.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780]   - Well, I looked at, so DeMotorin has data
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.820]   going back to 1928, and so I checked his data to years,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.460]   and the stock market returns real,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.260]   so this is 1928 to 2022, stocks real were 6.6%,
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.220]   and bonds were 1.5%, and cash was more like 0.2%.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260]   So in the more recent data,
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.420]   the stock market, you're right, has been similar.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.980]   It's bonds and cash that were a little lower,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.020]   and I'm guessing because of,
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.060]   part of that is the inflationary period
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.620]   that we had for like 30 years.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.540]   The interesting point you make,
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.020]   that stocks are like your best bet
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.900]   for inflation hedging over the long run,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.020]   it can be kind of confusing
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.540]   because we've seen inflation over the short run
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.420]   can ding stocks as it has, right?
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.300]   Rising inflation and rising rates
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.740]   can be bad for stocks in the short run,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.860]   but it's still by far your best bet
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.260]   for beating inflation over the long run,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.740]   and that's the thing that matters.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.300]   - Really long run, yes.
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.820]   You know, when the Fed starts tightening
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.300]   and raising interest rates,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.780]   there's some fear, there's some sell-off,
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.620]   but the companies have the pricing power.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.620]   Earnings and dividends grow.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.460]   You know, I've got a chart
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.900]   and some of my other decks that show
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.700]   the dividend growth for the last seven years
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.340]   has been 2% above inflation.
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.180]   It shows some things where companies grow pricing power
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.700]   with that inflation.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.860]   You know, now what's interesting,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.100]   bond returns today, so people have asked me,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.020]   should we be writing the book "Bonds for the Long Run,"
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.420]   and you mentioned you're getting all these questions
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.620]   on your show about bonds now.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.460]   You know, if you go to the history,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.380]   you see that long-term return was 3.5% for bonds.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.220]   You go back two years ago, the TIPS yields,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.060]   what you have today
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.340]   that you didn't have throughout history
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.820]   is you have inflation-protected securities.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.020]   TIPS yields are a real yield.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.340]   - Right, those are relatively new, too.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.980]   What, '96 or '97 or something? - '97.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.100]   1997 is when they first came out.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.700]   They first came out around 3%.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.340]   They got up as high as 4% in the boom of 2000,
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.620]   and that was a great time to buy TIPS.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.700]   When the S&PP was 30 and you had a 4% TIPS yield.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.300]   You know, you got to negative 1.5%.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.140]   It was crazy.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.780]   People were giving the government $100
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.820]   and getting 90 cents on the dollar 10 years later
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.740]   of purchasing power.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.940]   Like, after inflation purchasing power,
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.860]   they're giving the government 100,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.460]   taking back $90 late, you know, 10 years later.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.500]   - Right, it's a very unique asset now
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.940]   that you didn't have in the past.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.700]   So, all we have to go on is historical numbers, right?
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.580]   You can use, you can create probabilities based on history,
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.460]   but the thing that people probably care about most
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.300]   is like, okay,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.220]   how do we make reasonable assumptions going forward?
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.740]   So, Duncan, let's go into the next question
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   because that's the real question is,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   okay, we have the historical data,
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.980]   but what about going forward?
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.900]   So, Duncan, do the next one.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500]   - Okay, and that question was from Alex, by the way.
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   So, this is from Jeff.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.700]   Can U.S. stocks keep up the same pace
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.920]   of 8% to 10% annual returns over the long run?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.580]   And then you have here a tweet from Sam Parr.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.420]   - Yeah, so a bunch of people actually sent us this.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.260]   So, Sam Parr said,
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.620]   I believe American markets over the next 100 years
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.260]   will most look like the last 100 years,
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.700]   meaning 8% per year.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.780]   He's saying, I don't have too much data.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.740]   He's basically trying to figure out,
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.140]   can what just happened in the last 100 years
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.460]   happen over the next 100 years?
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.340]   And I think a lot of people,
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.700]   prognosticators about the U.S. stock market
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.440]   have kind of said, well, yes, we've done so this far.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.460]   John, do a chart on here
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.340]   of the world equity markets that I have.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.020]   So, this just shows, in 1900,
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.620]   the U.S. made up 15% of global equity markets
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.900]   by market capitalization.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.680]   Today, it's more like 60%.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.460]   I always say it looks kind of like Pac-Man
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.860]   eating the rest of the world.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.060]   And so, a lot of people say, well, yeah, that's fine.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.360]   Winners write the history books.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.780]   The U.S. has been great,
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.900]   but can it keep that up when valuations are now higher
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.080]   and more people know about it?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.620]   So, how do you think about this, Jeremy?
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.960]   I mean, we know the long-term drivers.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.100]   It's fundamentals like earnings and cash flows
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.980]   and revenue and all these things.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.940]   How do you think about real returns going forward
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.680]   and whether the U.S. can actually duplicate that
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.620]   or at least give investors pretty good returns?
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.220]   I don't know, anything four, five, 6% real
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.980]   over the next, call it two, three decades.
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.740]   - Yeah, I have a few charts to help make that point.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.100]   And one is a very simple fundamental relationship,
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.820]   and then we can get into some details.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.820]   My chart dunking on P/E ratios from 1960 to 2023,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.420]   this goes back, there's a fundamental relationship
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.620]   between what you pay and what your return is.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   In bonds, I was getting to that point
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.580]   on the negative tip shields that you had.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.060]   I was gonna say, now the 10-year tip shield
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.340]   is approaching two and a half,
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.160]   maybe you're 240 on the 10-year tips.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.660]   And people generally understand this point better with bonds.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.060]   Hey, your real return on bonds is gonna be very much tied
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.980]   to what is your interest rate that you're getting.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.300]   And so, a valuation bonds is very intuitive
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   to connect to real returns.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.300]   - That's a good point.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.860]   Like, bonds are based on math.
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.180]   It's a lot easier to understand.
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.760]   The prices are going down, but the yields are going up,
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.380]   so you know your expected returns are going higher in bonds.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.100]   - Yep, and so you're getting two and a half percent.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.860]   It's a yield, and you could do the same thing with stocks.
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.360]   You know, when we showed the six and a half
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.940]   to seven percent return that stocks had,
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.180]   that's very much because the average P/E ratio
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.960]   over time was 15.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.560]   One divided by 15 is your earnings yield.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.180]   That gets you around that six to seven percent return.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.820]   And so, if you have a higher P/E ratio
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.580]   for the market as a whole,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.460]   that means you're gonna have a lower expected return.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.200]   Now, we think the fair multiple today
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.980]   is probably closer to 20 than 15,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180]   and there's a lot of reasons why.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.260]   You can see this upward-tilted slope P/E.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.060]   You know, you had single-digit P/Es.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.120]   It was in the '70s and '80s
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.500]   when you had double-digit interest rates.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.900]   - So we're looking at an earnings yield now
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.540]   of more like five percent.
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.820]   - Yeah, I'd say it's even a little bit higher.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.700]   When I look at the P/Es for next year,
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.340]   you're around 17 to 18 times,
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.780]   so you might be five and a half to six percent P/Es.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.820]   Five and a half to six percent earnings yield,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.740]   so pretty reasonable.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.620]   And that, again, is a real return indicator.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.740]   So you add inflation on top of that.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.100]   So if you think two to three percent inflation,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.720]   you're at seven and a half to nine percent.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.220]   So they're lower than the long-term average of eight to 10.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.500]   We're not gonna say you can do exactly the six, seven
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.620]   that you did before,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.540]   but bonds are 100 basis points lower.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.740]   Stocks are 100 basis points lower.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.460]   So the question is, is the equity premium still alive?
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.780]   You're still getting paid about three percent more
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.020]   for stock risk than bond risk.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.620]   - Which, and that also fluctuates,
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.740]   but that's a good way to look at it.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.500]   Are you still gonna earn a premium
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.860]   over these other risk assets?
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.620]   And that, I don't see what would cause
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.120]   that relationship to go away.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.980]   - Well, if you got to a four percent tips yield
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.980]   and the earnings yield on stocks was three,
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.820]   you could say, all right,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.300]   now we're gonna get a better deal on bonds,
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.060]   which is what you had in 2000, by the way.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.260]   - Right, and probably what you would have seen
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.020]   in the '80s, too, when P/Es got to eight or seven
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   because inflation was so high.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.380]   That'd be the kind of scenario
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.920]   where it might flip out for a short time, at least.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.420]   - Yeah, perhaps the bond yields spike
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.660]   and you get an opportunity.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.720]   But right now, there's still a three percent cushion,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.900]   even though people say,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.420]   oh, there's so much more competition from bonds.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.140]   You had short-term treasury at five and a half percent.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.300]   That's like apples and oranges
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.100]   because you don't take inflation from that.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.580]   People don't think that five and a half percent
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.180]   is gonna stay forever.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.140]   The tips yields are the right benchmark
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.820]   when you compare stock yields,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.380]   earnings yields on stocks, real assets,
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.220]   versus tips yields.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.580]   You see a lot of these charts going around.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.880]   A lot of very smart people on Twitter
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.140]   are doing earnings yields versus the nominal yield,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.660]   and that's just wrong in our view.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.120]   Stocks are more like real assets.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.500]   You gotta compare it to tips yields.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.340]   - Right, okay.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.540]   - Are you saying that we have to update
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.900]   Ben Graham ratios in 2023?
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:08.740]   - You know, there's all sorts of things.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.180]   - We can't rebuy all the same numbers?
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.580]   - It's a little different today.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.900]   - John, show these long-term real stock market bales.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.740]   I think this is interesting.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.040]   So you look at, you break it out in a different series
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.380]   and different starting points of EPS growth
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.200]   and dividend growth.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.220]   And I think that the dividend growth
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.980]   is the one that I think surprises most people,
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.700]   that dividends, not only,
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.460]   dividends themselves are also an inflation hedge, right?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.540]   Because they're growing faster than the rate of inflation.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.300]   So people look at the yield on stocks these days
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.740]   and say, geez, they're way, way lower
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.100]   than they were in the past.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.140]   And part of that is it's still growing over time
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.900]   and growing greater than the rate of inflation,
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.620]   which you don't really get with bonds besides tips.
[00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.540]   And then the other thing is,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.580]   I know you've done work on this too,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.740]   is buybacks are a bigger piece of it now.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.920]   So you have to think of total shareholder yield
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.300]   in terms of paying back debt
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.900]   and buying back stock and EPS growth.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.640]   So maybe you can talk a little bit of these numbers.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.380]   - Yeah, in the first, maybe go to the second row,
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.420]   1871 to 1945, amazing how high the dividend yield was
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   in the first 70 years, 5%.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.380]   You know, when we talk about now,
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.140]   maybe the forward return is 5%.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.280]   Back in those first 70 years,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.180]   you got all of that just from the dividend yield.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.980]   People treated stocks like bonds
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.340]   and you got these 5% yields.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.860]   - And didn't corporations kind of have to
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.300]   have higher dividend yields to get people off the sidelines
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.820]   and invest in stocks in the first place?
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.980]   Wasn't that the idea?
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.140]   - Yeah, they thought of them very much like bonds.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.940]   You saw no real EPS growth.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.100]   They were paying out, it's almost like a REIT today
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.380]   that pays out all of its earnings, its dividends.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.060]   You saw very high payout ratios.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.660]   Now we're doing more buybacks and we're investing.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.300]   This question is, there's some people who say
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.820]   all that reinvestment is squandered, right?
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.620]   And so that is not what we see in that data.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.860]   Like if you go back to the table for a second,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.300]   what you see is, all right, the payout ratio dropped
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.860]   from the first 70 years to the next 80 years.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.780]   The payout ratios went from 67 to 49.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.780]   It's dropped even more now.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.380]   But what you saw is the earnings growth
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.700]   went up from 70 basis points, 67 basis points
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.740]   in the first column, second row, to 3.5%.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.180]   Earnings growth did go up when people,
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.100]   the dividend yield went down by 2%.
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.580]   You went from 5.3 dividend yield to 3.3.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.260]   And the earnings growth went up from 70 to 3.4.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.100]   So it's actually even more than the drop in the dividend yield.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.140]   - So allocation by CEOs has actually improved performance
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.740]   of corporations in the last 70 years or whatever.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.940]   - At least it's not dropping off.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.140]   I mean, it's being done one for one to earnings growth.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.380]   It's not just wasted.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.620]   They're not just squandering these buybacks,
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.620]   buying overly inflated stocks.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.500]   And 'cause it's dropped again.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.940]   It's not 3% on average now.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.260]   Now it's below 2%.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.380]   And so this question is, are the buybacks wasted?
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.220]   Is the reinvestment wasted?
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.180]   No, we actually think earnings growth will be higher
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.980]   in the future than it was in the past.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.940]   - So if we tell people to temper their expectations
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.180]   a little bit from the past,
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.940]   it's not like they're gonna be,
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.020]   we're looking at like 1% or 2% real returns
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.420]   like some people are predicting.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.380]   Like the real return forecast
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.660]   is still looking pretty decent for stocks.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.420]   - Yeah, we think 5.5% to 6%
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.900]   will be your call for sure of the next decade,
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.260]   but five, seven years, also pretty reasonable for that too.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.540]   - So buybacks are a fairly modern phenomenon.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.980]   Is that the takeaway?
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.340]   - 1982 is when it really started.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.900]   And there was all sorts of speculation
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.740]   of what causes each thing.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.780]   - They changed the law, right?
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.460]   Wasn't it like, I mean, it was kind of a murky thing
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.580]   where there were some buybacks,
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.980]   but people, they didn't really do it.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.260]   And then there was some law change
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.940]   and it kind of opened the floodgates, right?
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.180]   - A few things related.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.740]   It's tied to incentive compensation
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.500]   is people respond to incentives always.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.220]   So it had to do with using stock options.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.660]   People started doing a lot more stock options.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.580]   When you do a stock option, you pay a dividend,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.460]   your price goes down by the amount of the dividend
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.380]   on the X date.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.500]   And when you have stock options,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.340]   you don't want your dividend,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.220]   you don't want your price to go down,
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.340]   you want your price to go up.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.020]   And you saw it the day Microsoft paid its first dividend,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.660]   they canceled their stock option policy,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.260]   they started doing restricted stock.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.860]   It was very much related to what you could expense
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.940]   and then also what the much heavier use of stock options.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.780]   - That makes sense.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.140]   - And so that's encouraged it,
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.620]   but again, we don't think people,
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.420]   there's a lot of focus on buybacks
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.180]   and are they issuing shares?
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.660]   There is some, a lot of share issuance for these options.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.860]   So there's dilution happening,
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.660]   but there's still a vast majority of buybacks.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.380]   - And you can look at like net buybacks as well, right?
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:07.220]   - Yes.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.060]   - That aren't given out.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.820]   All right, so we talked a lot about U.S. stocks
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.780]   and people are worried about U.S. stocks.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.180]   So I want to get into a little bit international.
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.180]   So we've got a couple of questions on that.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.700]   So Duncan, let's do the next one.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.780]   And then we've got a couple of questions
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.580]   on international stocks as well.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.500]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Christian in Japan.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.940]   I'm Japanese, but I invest mostly in U.S. stocks
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:24.980]   via index funds.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.420]   Since my income is in yen,
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.480]   when I invest, I do it in two ways.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.220]   With half the money, I buy U.S. currency
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.420]   and then buy ETFs, same as you guys.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.760]   I hold the security in USD
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.980]   within my brokerage account here in Japan.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.660]   With the other half, I buy Japanese mutual funds
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.980]   that contain a basket of U.S. stocks.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.860]   These assets are held in yen.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.780]   In 2022 and 2023, I noticed the Japanese part
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.180]   of my investments was way higher up
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.220]   than the part denominated in USD,
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.120]   even though the holdings are similar.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.900]   The Japanese mutual funds are non-currency hedged.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.220]   Is there any anomaly that I should be aware of?
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.020]   Should I currency hedge my investments
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.380]   or am I taking too much risk
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.460]   by buying U.S. securities denominated in yen?
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.140]   - This is one of the more unique questions.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.160]   We've actually gotten questions from expats in the past.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.700]   Jeremy, I thought of you immediately
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.240]   when we got this question in.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.260]   I don't think I know of anyone in our business
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.880]   who spent more time talking or educating people
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.280]   about currency hedging.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.500]   We talked about this before we got on.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.520]   It's kind of a confusing question in a lot of ways,
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.780]   but I think this person,
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.660]   it sounds like they're buying half of their portfolio
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.380]   with U.S. dollar and half of it with yen,
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.860]   and then they're able to compare those changes.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.180]   And I guess the way to think about this
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.180]   from the perspective of a U.S. investor,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.100]   which is most of our audience,
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.140]   is when you invest in international stocks,
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.940]   you're not currency hedging.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.180]   The change in the U.S. dollar can impact your returns
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.020]   for international stocks.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.340]   If the U.S. dollar is strong,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.200]   your international stocks are gonna look weaker.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.140]   So what do you think about this?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.460]   'Cause it is an interesting comparison
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.500]   'cause they have the one-to-one comparison to look at.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.740]   Like this part of the portfolio with this currency
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.340]   is doing way better than this one.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.340]   - If Christian's on, I'd love to follow up
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.440]   on what I think is happening,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.660]   but I'll tell you what I think is happening.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.380]   I have a Quayfin chart on the dollar versus the yen
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.740]   and then the S&P 500.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.380]   Over the last few years,
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.300]   you have a record move in this yen.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.620]   The yen's down 43% versus the dollar.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.540]   So if he's buying in his Japanese account,
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.620]   which is basically buying the stocks,
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.280]   they're doing the same transaction as he's doing
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.500]   where he had to sell yen to buy dollars
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.420]   and they got exposure to this Japanese yen
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:28.660]   that's up 43%, which is up more.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.860]   The dollar's up more than the S&P's up.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.540]   Add those two together, you're up like 65%.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.300]   Now, I think what may be happening,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.220]   this is my suspicion,
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.700]   is he's doing basically the same thing the fund is doing,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.900]   but the account in dollars
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.260]   hasn't been translated back to yen yet.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.540]   When he translates it back,
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.180]   he may have the exact same return
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.140]   because he's holding it in dollars
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.740]   and then the yen's been depreciating.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.020]   He's seeing the dollars.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.480]   Now, if he's seeing it all in yen,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.140]   there may be something else compositionally
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.980]   about what he's buying,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.700]   that maybe he's buying some tech stocks in one place
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.060]   and not tech stocks in another place.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.220]   But my suspicion is that he's looking at the account
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.540]   and when he buys the yen back,
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.500]   he's gonna have almost the same exact return.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.460]   Now, the question, the broader question on,
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.100]   should you hedge the yen?
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.220]   Should he, does he expect a strong yen going forward?
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.740]   Should he hedge more of that, right?
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.420]   So, for U.S. investors, you had a very strong dollar.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.780]   Should you have been hedging your euro and yen in pound?
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.180]   I've been one of the leading people saying,
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.460]   I think the S&P 500 has a weak dollar bias to it.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.340]   Our earnings are from abroad.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.260]   Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Microsoft, all these tech companies
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.260]   have a lot of foreign revenue.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.020]   We already have a weak dollar bias.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.340]   You don't need the euro and yen.
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.620]   You could hedge it and you're sort of paid to hedge
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.460]   in the U.S.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.860]   For Japan, it's the opposite.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.780]   I mean, Warren Buffett did this too.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.900]   When Warren Buffett bought Japanese stocks,
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.380]   he started issuing debt in local currency.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.660]   He has no yen risk,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.660]   even though people might think the yen is cheap.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.580]   - And also Buffett hedged it out too, so.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.420]   - Yes.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.340]   - So do you think in another country like this,
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.980]   like we've gotten questions from people
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.500]   in like third world countries too who say,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.240]   my currency is so volatile.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.220]   Do you think that currency hedging matters even more
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.460]   for those type of places than the U.S.?
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.620]   - Well, and the interest rates you're paid, right?
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.580]   So Japan, in the U.S., as a U.S. investor,
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.740]   we're paid over 6% to hedge the yen.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.260]   I have a chart on the annualized carry across markets.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.780]   This shows DXJ versus EWJ and the S&P 500.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.300]   So this is one example of the last 10 years.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.060]   People say nothing's outperformed the S&P 500.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.780]   Is there an interesting example of our Japan hedge ETF
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.540]   that actually has outperformed the S&P 500
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.660]   for the last decade?
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.260]   - So John, there's one, yeah, annualized carry.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.100]   There we go.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.460]   So explain to the audience what this is.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.860]   What do you mean by carry here?
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.020]   - So carry is how much you're paid to hedge.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.020]   And so the way they charge you,
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.420]   people have said, you know,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   to hedge your currency is expensive.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.940]   I would agree for Christian to hedge the dollar.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.760]   It's expensive.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.380]   He's paying the reverse of this.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.100]   It's the relative interest rate.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.220]   The Fed's been hiking rates to five and a quarter.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.100]   Japan still has negative rates.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.780]   And so because of that,
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.060]   there's an arbitrage that exists
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.700]   that when you want to try to hedge your currency rates,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.680]   you enter forward contracts.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.260]   The way their price is based on interest rate differentials.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.220]   And so this is what you're paid to hedge the yen.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.740]   - And the yen looks like the most attractive one
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.580]   on here, obviously.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.300]   - 'Cause their central bank hasn't done anything.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.340]   They're still at negative rates.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.460]   You know, you heard from the ECB.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.220]   They're closer to 4%.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.420]   So there's, you know, less carry to hedge the Euro,
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.460]   but you're still paid to hedge the Euro.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.380]   You know, so when you have a very high interest rate,
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.500]   you're often paid to hedge the foreign currency rate.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.580]   So if you're in an emerging market,
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.060]   you might be paid to hedge these currencies.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.340]   - Now, you and Michael and I have had many discussions
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.980]   about this over the years about currency hedging,
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.020]   and you're obviously a huge proponent of it.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.220]   And my take has always been,
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.620]   don't you want some other currencies
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.820]   to give you another form of diversification?
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.260]   Why do you think that is wrong?
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.860]   - Yeah, I think that's a misnomer.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.260]   I mean, so I have another table.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.180]   - Because if you look over like 40 years,
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.700]   there's a ton of movements in the currencies.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.540]   Like if you look at the dollar,
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.700]   but doesn't it kind of even out at the end?
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.780]   - So maybe we could show my table
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.460]   on the returns and volatility of these markets.
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.500]   - Okay, I think what you're asking for, Ben,
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.940]   is a target date fund of currencies?
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.420]   Is that what you're asking?
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.740]   - So the top table is the returns,
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.420]   and you can see the returns are fairly similar.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.260]   So this goes to your point
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.620]   that maybe it doesn't make that much difference.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.300]   But over some periods, it can make a lot of difference.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.580]   And, you know, the volatility is below.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.260]   When you go to just the local markets,
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.060]   you have consistently two to three percentage points,
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.620]   much lower volatility, last five years.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.460]   - Okay, so that makes sense.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.420]   So you're saying that the currency is more volatile,
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.260]   that actually increases your volatility.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.780]   So taking that out of the fact,
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.100]   it actually, maybe it does decrease your volatility.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.220]   I buy that, that makes sense.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.540]   - It's a much, yeah, so it's a smoother ride.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.560]   And, you know, you can see, and the returns up top,
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.660]   it has cost you 2% a year the last three, five, 10 years.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.500]   You know, so you can see--
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.660]   - Right, 'cause the dollar's been so strong.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.580]   - It has been strong.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.020]   And now in Japan, you get this extra drive,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.340]   you get 6% on top of the local market returns.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.320]   So, you know, it's actually this added return
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.540]   on top of if you're a Japanese buying their local market,
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.900]   you're paid this additional carry.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.940]   It's a nice added return stream.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.700]   - Okay, so for our next question,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.820]   it's funny because the first couple of questions,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.220]   a lot of people are worried about U.S. stocks, right?
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:17.540]   How could the U.S. possibly continue to do what it's done?
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.020]   And then people say like, what am I supposed to do
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.220]   if U.S. stocks have lower returns going forward?
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.220]   And the answer staring you in the face,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.220]   of course, it could be things like,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.020]   well, you diversify into small caps, or REITs,
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.020]   or some of the value strategies, or whatever it is,
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.780]   some other strategy in the U.S.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.540]   But the other alternative is,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.380]   look at the rest of the world.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.180]   So let's look at the next question
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.620]   and talk about this a little bit.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:38.380]   - All right, so David writes,
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.060]   "I've been a globally diversified investor
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.140]   "for two decades now,
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.320]   "and it's starting to feel like a black hole.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.620]   "My U.S. stocks have performed wonderfully,
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.360]   "but it seems like foreign stocks are always lagging.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.060]   "Is it even worth it to diversify internationally anymore?"
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.060]   - I've heard a lot of people with this sentiment in recent years.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.660]   - Yes, we've gotten a lot of questions,
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.740]   especially people who've been investing
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.220]   for a long time and see.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.820]   And I mean, you don't have to go back that far
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.620]   to see when international stocks outperformed,
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.580]   but this cycle has been,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.220]   it feels like it's been going on forever,
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.240]   especially since the 2008 crisis, pretty much.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   So this is the other side of the coin, right?
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.760]   People are worried about U.S. stocks
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.460]   because they performed too well,
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.380]   but people are also worried about international stocks
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.960]   'cause they haven't performed well enough.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.300]   And I think that's kind of your answer
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.980]   if you're really worried about the U.S.,
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.300]   but what do you think about diversifying internationally?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   'Cause it has been a really long streak
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.860]   of underperformance against the U.S.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.540]   - Yeah, people call it de-worsification.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.540]   You're gonna worsify your portfolio by going international.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.880]   - Sorry, just to get back to the last question,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.140]   how much of it can be chalked up over the last 15 years
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.140]   to a really strong dollar?
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.440]   Does that, I mean, it's hard to do the attribution there,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.900]   but that's part of it, correct?
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.740]   - Some of it is, but more of it is multiple expansion
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.940]   in the U.S. and--
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.980]   - Tech stocks and--
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.300]   - Yes, so I have a few charts.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.740]   One is, it's not just a U.S. phenomenon
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.900]   that stocks are the best asset everywhere.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.260]   We show, there was a book, "Triumph of the Optimist"
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.380]   by Dimson Marshall Stanton that showed
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.820]   that stocks actually did well on a global basis.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.740]   The U.S. wasn't even the best country over the last--
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.260]   - John, do a chart onto this average stock.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.900]   Yeah, so this shows stocks, bonds, and cash by country.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.640]   This is developed countries going back to 1900.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.040]   That's one of my favorite annual updates
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.180]   when they show this.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.220]   - Yeah, and to your point, the stock market everywhere
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.900]   pretty much gives you better returns.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.940]   It's not like the stock markets around the world are equal.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.220]   I've always wondered, why is South Africa
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.620]   always at the top of the list?
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.860]   - It was probably a cheap country at low multiples.
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.140]   It shows you that growth doesn't have to be
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.300]   the single dominating question.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.900]   That's one of those other things that people think,
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.740]   hey, if Europe's a mess from GDP growth,
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.140]   is it going to be a good place?
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.940]   Well, it might be priced at 10 times earnings,
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.260]   and that valuation can prove over time
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.620]   that you don't need real growth to be the big winner.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.700]   - So what do you think when people ask
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.220]   about international diversification?
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.100]   They say, listen, I'm ready to give up on it.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.300]   The US already has 40% of their sales coming from overseas.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.260]   What's the point of investing internationally
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.080]   in the first place?
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.100]   How do you answer that?
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.940]   - Well, I come back to where we talked about
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.800]   that P/E ratio driving returns.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.080]   So we talked about 15 was our average here.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.780]   Now we're at 18.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.700]   Europe is at 11.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.580]   The way we do Japan, it's at 12.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.420]   You got some single digit multiples
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.380]   in some of these places.
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.600]   So that is a long-term return driver,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.460]   and so if we did the earnings yield of those countries,
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.340]   we're looking at the US, what did we say, 5% or 6% maybe?
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.180]   - Yes.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.820]   - Internationally, it's probably more like 7%, 8%, 9%,
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.660]   depending on where you look.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   - Yeah, 8% to 9% in many places.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.400]   So I think that does help matter.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.320]   It's extra cushion.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.540]   And yes, the US has won, tech has won,
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.380]   but that may not last forever.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.080]   - Duncan, do they have open up stocks overseas?
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.580]   - OB is Swedish.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.420]   It's a Swedish company. - Oh, it is?
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.240]   I didn't know this.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.620]   Okay, all right, there you go.
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.640]   So John, I think we have a picture of the four PEs, right,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.880]   of the different companies.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.020]   So you have IFA in Europe versus the S&P 500,
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.160]   and you kind of break it down
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.560]   into standard deviations as well.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.880]   And to be fair, you could have made this same point,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.020]   I feel like, for the past seven years straight.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.320]   Listen, international stocks are cheap.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.680]   You could have pounded the table on this,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.920]   and you would have been wrong.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.400]   The US has gone from, I think, 50% of the world market cap
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.240]   or so to 60, and just continued its dominance.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.000]   And again, a big part of that, like you said,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.640]   is a multiple expansion and then tech stocks,
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.200]   'cause there isn't as big of a tech sector
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.880]   anywhere else in the world, I guess maybe China.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.380]   But I think that's part of the reason
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.480]   that international stocks have lagged so bad.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.120]   So when you look at valuations like this,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.520]   do you try to think of a catalyst
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.080]   of what's gonna cause this to change?
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.440]   Or do you think, eventually,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.960]   that it's just that the fundamentals sort of went out?
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.520]   - You don't know what will be the catalyst.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.320]   I mean, but even just the last few days,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.600]   you don't overdraw from just a short-term earning season,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.560]   but you get inflated expectations.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.820]   It's hard to keep meeting those expectations.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.560]   And so there could be a point where the tech dominance,
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.320]   that they get to a multiple, that the earnings growth,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.160]   the expectation just become too high.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.640]   I mean, I'm definitely worried about that.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.120]   With NVIDIA, we published a big piece
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.660]   on being the most expensive stock of the S&P,
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.860]   but that is definitely high.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.760]   I mean, there's some reasons why
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.000]   it should be as high as it is.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.880]   They've had earnings worth like nothing else
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.720]   over the last decade.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.120]   - The fundamentals have come through for technology,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.840]   but I guess the question would be,
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.120]   can they continue to come through
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.440]   and beat those expectations going forward?
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.280]   - Yeah, much tougher.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.360]   So I think that's where you don't know
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.640]   what will cause the full rebound,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.880]   but at some point, their earning starts disappointing.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.000]   It's really when the earnings start disappointing
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.040]   that it then turns and it becomes the cycle in reverse.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.920]   - And I guess that's the diversification thing that you say.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.960]   There's so many people worried
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.560]   about the magnificent seven in tech stocks.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.200]   If that's like your biggest worry,
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.840]   if you invest overseas,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.240]   it's such a smaller piece of the pie internationally,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.640]   sector-wise, that you don't have
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.520]   that tech concentration to worry about.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.240]   So it's also a diversification piece by sector
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.460]   and type of strategy where it's probably
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.720]   more value stocks as well, right?
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.560]   As opposed to growth.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.400]   - Very much true, very true.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.160]   It definitely, it tilts you all in those exact directions.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.680]   - I find the home country bias thing so fascinating.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.280]   I think we've talked about it in the past,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.760]   but we met up with a compound listener
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.080]   from Australia a while back for coffee,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.680]   and they were talking about their portfolio
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.340]   and just how much Australia was in it.
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.180]   - It's the same thing in most countries.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.120]   - And we were just talking like,
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.320]   how much Australia do we have
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.880]   in our international holdings?
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.400]   - And if you look at the numbers,
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.220]   a lot of the biggest,
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.800]   like Apple is as big as the UK stock market or something,
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.640]   or Germany.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.660]   I've done some of these comparisons
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.080]   where those other stock markets,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.280]   and they do have big home country bias.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.720]   Canada is the same thing.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.320]   And a lot of these countries are so much smaller
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.480]   than the US when it relates to the rest of the world.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.320]   I think the US,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.080]   you can get away with a little home country bias,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.480]   a little easier 'cause it's such a big part
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.640]   of the overall market cap.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.760]   But if you're doing it in another country,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.640]   if your country makes up 2% of the market cap
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.480]   and you have 90% of your stocks there,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.000]   that's a huge concentration risk.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.460]   And a lot of those countries too,
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.060]   people worry about the concentration in our market.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.320]   You know this probably better than me, Jeremy.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.160]   Like the concentration
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.960]   in some of those other global stock markets,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.040]   there might be 50% in two names or something.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.300]   It's like a way bigger concentration
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.720]   in some of these smaller countries as well.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.560]   - I'll tell you,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.920]   they do tend to think more sensitive about currencies.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.600]   You go to Europe and they're very currency savvy
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.440]   and always thinking about that hedging question
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.080]   a little bit more than we do here.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.440]   But it's an interesting dynamic.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.840]   And it is true that everybody gets more familiar
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.760]   with their own market.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.520]   And then they do put more of their,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.960]   it's a natural human behavior that they do that.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.760]   But if you're trying to really not make a bet
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.160]   on one thing outperforming forever,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.640]   we do believe in that global diversification story.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480]   - All right.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.040]   All right, we got one more question here.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.440]   This is the plant for me.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.760]   - Should you just ask this, Ben?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.600]   It's you.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.680]   - Read it, Duncan.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.720]   - Okay.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.480]   Make your case for why inflation is actually lower
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.600]   than it seems and the Fed should stop hiking.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.440]   - All right.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.960]   So Jeremy, you and Professor Siegel
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.740]   have been making this case for a while now
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.660]   that inflation is actually lower than it appears.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.320]   And most people are going the opposite direction right now.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.640]   Most people are saying, listen,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.880]   no, have you been to the grocery store?
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.000]   Have you seen gas prices?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.460]   Have you tried to buy a car or a house?
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.840]   Prices are way higher than the government is saying.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.960]   So the big lever here that you've been talking about
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.840]   is shelter inflation, right?
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   Which is the biggest component in inflation calculations.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.040]   How much of a percentage is it?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.200]   Like 40% or something, 30?
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.960]   - In core CPI, it's over 40%.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.760]   In headline CPI, that excludes energy and food,
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.000]   it's like a third.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:17.840]   So yeah, it's a massive thing.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.440]   - Okay, so make your case that when you look
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   at shelter inflation,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.680]   that it actually is being overstated right now.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.920]   And to be fair, it probably was understated before.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.740]   - Yes.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.580]   - 12 months ago.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:28.520]   So what's your case here?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.600]   Make your case.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.440]   - So when you look at the key drivers of the shelter,
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.960]   we're doing some very simple calculations.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.320]   We're taking all of the official CPI numbers from the BLS.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.020]   But right now, the BLS tells you shelter inflation is 7%.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.100]   And that is just not reality.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.840]   The home prices by Case-Shuler Index are flat to negative.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.400]   They're flat basically the last 12 months.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.160]   Yes, rents are still going up, but they're not at 7%.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.000]   And--
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.060]   - Right, rents are rolling over, maybe flat-ish,
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.900]   up one or two percent.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.720]   - Some are negative.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.560]   Some are negative.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.240]   We have a few different indexes that show different things,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.600]   but anywhere from 3% to negative.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.080]   So when we put in,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.360]   we put in Case-Shuler for owner's equivalent rent,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.960]   and then we put in the Zillow rent for rent.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.160]   And I have--
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.500]   - John, throw up the chart here, John.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.340]   There you go.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.360]   - So yeah, so my shelter inflation, instead of 7.2,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.520]   the bottom panel is 2.6.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.680]   And so when I plug in that number,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.040]   all we're doing is plugging that number
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.680]   into both headline inflation, which is the first panel,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.800]   and then core inflation is the second panel.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.740]   We get both headline and core
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.320]   right in the Fed's range of 2%.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.680]   I mean, right below 2%.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   I actually had a zero handle this on a few months ago
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.180]   before energy started ticking up.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.240]   And so, you know, our view is
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.200]   this is gonna come down next year.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.560]   You know, eventually the shelter inflation
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.820]   catches up with reality.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.240]   And so it may be May, maybe September into next year.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.680]   It's gonna take a little bit of time.
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.400]   The San Francisco Fed published a piece
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.480]   with a lot of the same series that I looked at,
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.520]   and they had some forecasts that actually showed
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.600]   shelter might go negative next year.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.640]   If you get negative shelter middle of next year,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.840]   you're gonna, the Feds will be at 2% very easily.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.880]   - And people always say like every economic data point
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   is lagging indicator, but to your point here,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.180]   if you show, John, fill those charts back up real quick.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.240]   If you look at your alternate inflation indicator here,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.000]   you're showing when rents and housing prices
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.800]   were going crazy back in the day,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.640]   inflation probably was actually way higher
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.200]   than we realized it at the time, and now it's lower.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   So if you sort of average it out, it works.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.840]   But that's the point is that the rent stuff especially
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.680]   is even more of a lagging indicator
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.960]   and not telling you what's going on right now,
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   whereas some of these other prices like gas and energy
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.320]   and food probably make more sense right now.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.440]   So your point has been, listen, the Fed,
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.780]   they should not be thinking about raising anymore,
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.720]   especially if you look at this,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.500]   and it's gonna catch up eventually,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.840]   and that's gonna bring core CPI down.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.000]   - Yeah, Siegel is for sure one of the loudest critics
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.840]   of the Fed.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.560]   I mean, as early as on Barry's podcast back in May of 2020,
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.200]   he said this explosion in money supply
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.160]   is gonna lead to inflation.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.600]   Why is the Fed not focused on inflation?
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.440]   - I do, I remember that.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.160]   He was saying, he was predicting like 15%,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.320]   20% cumulative inflation, which is essentially what we got.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.100]   - Yes, exactly what you got.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.640]   But now that money supply has come out,
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.480]   and then earlier this year,
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.520]   he was worried 'cause the money supply was shrinking
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.840]   and you don't want the money supply to shrink,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.600]   you want to go 5% a year.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.720]   And so he was quite cautious because of that dynamic.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480]   It's now growing again,
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.680]   and these other trends are coming back.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.720]   We're sort of the least critical of where the Fed is.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.480]   They're recognizing downside risks.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.120]   Our view, they probably don't hike again.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.200]   They don't need to.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.120]   We think they're gonna let things come to them.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.600]   These downward pressures will come next year.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.800]   But this was one of those things,
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.160]   when we looked at real estate prices moving up,
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.360]   it was up 40% from March, 2020, March, 2022.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.600]   And they were saying it was a transitory,
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.160]   like, no, no, no, this is gonna be a problem.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.440]   It's gonna keep being with you.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.120]   You should be hiking.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.320]   They shouldn't have let the money supply grow
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.500]   as fast as they did, but it's coming down.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.000]   Inflation is gonna come down.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.780]   - So maybe the point is the Fed is always a little bit slow
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.580]   to react in both directions.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.840]   - Yes.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.680]   - That makes sense.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.980]   - And I mean, was inflation actually transitory after all?
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.800]   - Well, it's coming down,
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.840]   but they didn't have to let inflation get as high as it did.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.360]   Basically, they gave the government,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.040]   they printed all the money the government
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.400]   needed to spend in the pandemic.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.960]   If they had to go to the bond market,
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.120]   interest rates would have risen much faster,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.520]   and they wouldn't have spent as much,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.600]   and inflation wouldn't have been as high.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.360]   So you can't let the Fed off the hook.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.720]   They created the problem.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.220]   We had Segal wrote a piece in Barron's a few weeks ago
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.080]   saying it's like you ran somebody with your car,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.780]   you take them to the hospital to save them.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.620]   It's not--
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.440]   - You heard it here first.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.240]   We are the only finance show on YouTube
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.660]   that's actually saying inflation is lower
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.360]   than it looks right now.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.840]   You're not gonna find this anywhere else, right?
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.240]   - Yes.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.080]   - All right.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.880]   Jeremy, tell everyone where they can kind of find
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.740]   your work besides stocks for the long run.
