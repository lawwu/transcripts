[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.780]   All right.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.160]   So we have another question here.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.640]   This is also from Patrick.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.880]   Patrick says, how do you structure your time
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.160]   if you love what you do?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160]   I wonder if this is the same Patrick as before.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.400]   It probably is, actually.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.980]   Here's a little bit of an elaboration.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.200]   Patrick says he's a PhD student and that he enjoys my work.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.080]   Thank you, Patrick.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.520]   He really loves what he's doing, but some of his leisure
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.440]   activities are related to his work.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.640]   So Patrick says he's researching AI,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.360]   but is also interested in the epistemology of knowledge
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360]   discovery from data.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   So he's reading philosophy and trying
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.280]   to write some epistemological short papers.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.240]   He's also taking some MOOCs, massively online courses,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840]   to improve his science writing skills.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.760]   He's doing that in his free time after he does
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.720]   schedule shutdown complete.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.080]   He also reviews academic papers and tries to eat healthy foods
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.040]   and reads a lot.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040]   And he's trying to figure out--
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.880]   here's what he says.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   As you can see, some of these leisure activities
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.760]   are also work-related, although not that closely.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.840]   I emphasize that I enjoy doing these activities.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.640]   Do you think this is a sustainable approach
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.360]   or do I need to focus more on another bucket of my life?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.840]   All right.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.200]   So basically, Patrick, you have a cool job
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.280]   and you have a lot of things you're interested in.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.000]   And there's a lot of overlap between the things
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.440]   you're interested in and your job.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.280]   And I think that's all great.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I'm not going to advocate for significantly reducing
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.360]   this energy and just leaving more time free
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.120]   in your schedule.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.040]   You're doing nothing because you're being energized by this.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.320]   I think what I would moderate here is commitment activities.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.760]   I'm going to draw a clear distinction.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.720]   Here are things I have to do as part of a long-term commitment
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.880]   versus here is something I'm going to do right now
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.040]   because it's interesting.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.720]   But it would be no problem if I didn't do it.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.440]   I'm interested in it.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.480]   I'm taking this online course at my own pace
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.320]   because I want to be a better science writer.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920]   I'm reading this book because I'm interested in the topic.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.840]   I have a hobby AI project I'm monkeying around with
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.040]   because it seems like it's interesting.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.960]   I think it's fine to have a bunch of stuff
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.720]   like that that you're using to fill up your leisure time
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.920]   because it's not going to cause stress if it's not commitments.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   It's not going to cause stress if you
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.960]   know that you can put the breakdown as needed.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   If something in work comes up that's urgent,
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.120]   you can not take that course for two weeks.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.360]   If there's a family emergency, it's not a big deal
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.680]   if you stop reading the book.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.360]   So make that distinction.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   Keep the stuff that you are committed to,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.880]   what you're doing in work, the academic projects you're
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   working on, the mentoring, the stuff
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160]   that you have to come back to and you have no options.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   Keep that reasonable.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.040]   Control that.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.880]   Keep that footprint small.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.440]   And then if you want to explore whatever in the time that
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.600]   remains, that's great.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.840]   I think that is good.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.480]   So just make that clear distinction.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.720]   Filling your time with things that you can pause as needed
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.240]   is, I think, completely fine if you find that energizing.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
