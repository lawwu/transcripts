[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.540]   Well, does John Piper add to the gospel?
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.840]   Namely, does John Piper add joy to the gospel?
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.360]   It's a question today from a listener named Brian.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.960]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.540]   I thank God for using your ministry to bless many people and to restore them
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.480]   to a meaningful relationship with God.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620]   I saw a recent tweet, a quote from you online saying, quote, 'You either
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.760]   treasure Jesus above all, or you're not saved.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.880]   If you don't value Jesus above everything else, you don't have saving faith.'
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.080]   End quote.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.960]   Now, such a hot potato tweet caught a lot of heat from Christians and pastors
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.040]   because the statement implies that treasuring Christ is perhaps a step in
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.760]   addition to believing Christ and hence adds to the gospel.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.700]   Some of the critique was about how this treasuring Christ is better put under
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300]   the umbrella of sanctification, not faith.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.500]   My knowledge of Christian hedonism is very small, so I would like to ask you,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.640]   is treasuring Christ a part of saving faith or does it come later in
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.600]   the process of sanctification?"
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.320]   So my tweet was, quote, "You either treasure Jesus above all, or you're not
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.860]   saved. If you don't value Jesus above everything else, you don't have saving
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.360]   faith."
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.760]   And the criticism is, treasuring Jesus above all as an essential mark of a
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.780]   Christian adds something to saving faith as the instrument of justification and so
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780]   corrupts the biblical doctrine of justification by faith alone.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.800]   So Brian puts it in a question, "Is treasuring Christ a part of saving
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.500]   faith or does it come later in sanctification?"
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.020]   Perhaps a couple of preliminary comments before I answer that question.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.580]   First, it's important to realize that all growth in every grace belongs to
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.020]   sanctification, including growth in faith, even though faith was there at the point
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.960]   of the beginning of the Christian life as the only instrument obtaining
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.900]   justification.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.340]   So to say that something is essential for the beginning of the Christian life does
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.780]   not exclude it as part of the ongoing experience of the growth of
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.740]   sanctification.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.860]   That's the first preliminary observation.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.820]   Second, when the Bible says that something is evidence that you are a
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.300]   Christian, you'll know them by their fruit, that you don't have saving faith
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.940]   unless you have that evidence or that fruit, that you're not born again without
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.580]   this fruit or evidence, this does not mean that the missing fruit or evidence
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.700]   has to be a constituent part of justifying faith.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.380]   For example, Hebrews 12, 14 says, "Strive for the holiness without which no one
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.740]   will see the Lord."
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.700]   Holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.500]   If you don't have this holiness, you're not going to see Jesus, which means
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   you're not saved.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.140]   In other words, there is a holiness, a measure of sanctification, without which
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.860]   we will not see Jesus.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.180]   We are not saved.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.700]   We will prove that we were not born of God.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.860]   We didn't have saving faith.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.500]   But that doesn't mean that such holiness is included in saving faith.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.620]   There are fruits in the Christian life that bear witness to the authenticity of
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.620]   the root or the tree of saving faith.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.060]   And the Bible is willing to say that without those fruits, we show that we are
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.140]   not saved.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.260]   We didn't really have authentic saving faith, which would have produced the
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.780]   fruit.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.580]   Third preliminary observation.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.020]   The text that I had in mind with that tweet is, "Whoever loves father or mother
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.340]   more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.500]   me is not worthy of me."
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.700]   This is Jesus' way of saying, "You are not truly my disciple.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.500]   You are not truly saved if you give me a nice, secure, steady, high-esteemed second
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.620]   place in your life.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.460]   I am number one in your life, or you're not mine."
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.420]   That's what he says.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.100]   This doesn't mean there's no struggle in the Christian life to treasure Jesus above
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.700]   everything.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:55.540]   It just means if the steady, continued condition of your heart is to have more
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.860]   affection for your family than for Jesus, you're not a Christian.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.500]   And Jesus says numerous other things like this.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.420]   In that tweet, I was simply echoing the strength of these words in Matthew 10:37.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.180]   Now, none of that answers the question.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.700]   Do I think that treasuring Jesus is part of saving faith?
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.140]   And my answer is yes, I do believe that treasuring Jesus is part of saving faith.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.500]   Here's why.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.340]   I take it from John 1, 11, and 12 that saving faith is a receiving of Christ.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.620]   I think the wording of verse 12 makes it clear that John wants us to define saving
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.180]   believing as saving receiving of Christ.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.380]   It goes like this.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.180]   "He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.700]   But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name," did the same thing.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.900]   "He gave the right to become the children of God."
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.540]   In saying this, Jesus is not saying that anything is being added to believing or
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.740]   added to faith as the instrument of justification.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.340]   Receiving Jesus is not a work.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.220]   It's a happy welcoming of the one who did the work and who works for us now.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:31.900]   So justifying faith, believing on Jesus, means receiving Jesus.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:41.180]   Now, what Christian hedonism does is press in to these words and asks, "What is the
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.660]   experience of receiving Christ really like?"
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.940]   Is it like receiving a blow to your face?
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.020]   No.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.580]   Is it like receiving a gift you need but don't want?
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.380]   Is it like receiving help that you like from someone you don't like?
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:09.340]   Is it like receiving a package from a postman that you love receiving, but you're
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.460]   scarce to even know the postman?
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.980]   Don't care to get to know him.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.060]   Christian hedonism will not settle for just familiar Christian words, "Receive,
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.980]   receive, receive."
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:26.060]   It presses in to the actual experience of believing and receiving Christ because it
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.380]   knows from the Bible there are many ways to receive Christ that are not saving ways.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.900]   The people in John 6 received him as a king, and Jesus escaped from them, didn't
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.260]   want anything to do with them.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.500]   The brothers of Jesus in John 7 received him as a miracle worker, and he said they
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.620]   didn't even have faith.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.260]   The people at the feast believed in John 2.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.380]   They believed, it says, "believed on Jesus in some sense, but Jesus would not
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.820]   entrust himself to them," John 2:24.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.060]   Simon the magician was so blown away by the reality of the Holy Spirit, he was
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.020]   ready to receive him with money.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.100]   He paid for him, and Jesus says, "Take your money and go to hell."
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:07.980]   That's what he said.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.740]   Read it, Acts 8.20.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:18.980]   Therefore, Christian hedonism presses in to the actual experience of receiving until
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.300]   it discerns what is this receiving?
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.900]   What is it really?
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.300]   What is the experience like?
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:34.140]   And what does it find in receiving Christ that is saving receiving?
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:42.140]   We must receive, Christian hedonism says, we must receive Christ not only as
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:49.020]   rescuer, not only as master, but as supreme treasure.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:55.580]   The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.500]   covered up, and then in his joy, he sells everything he has to buy that field.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.260]   Or again, "Whoever loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.780]   Or Paul in Philippians 3.8, "I count everything as lost because of this
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.900]   passing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.940]   You read that in context and you'll see it's a definition of faith.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.260]   It's interchangeable with faith.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:27.020]   In other words, receiving Christ in a saving way, and remember, receiving is the
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:34.340]   biblical synonym for believing, receiving Christ in a saving way means preferring
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.700]   Christ over all other persons and things.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:43.500]   It means desiring him, not only what he can do.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:53.180]   Desiring, receiving, welcoming, embracing is what we exercise toward what he is.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.380]   We desire him, receive him, welcome him, embrace him.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.900]   It means being satisfied with all that God is for us in him, in Jesus, even though we
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.500]   can't see fully at all that God is for us in Jesus.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.780]   We grow, we grow in that seeing and that satisfaction.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.700]   We grow in faith.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.380]   We don't receive Jesus in a saving way when we receive him as a ticket out of
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.500]   hell or a ticket into heaven.
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.540]   He's not a ticket.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.900]   He is a treasure.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.620]   He's the greatest treasure.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.580]   He is what makes heaven heaven.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:44.820]   If we trust him to get us into heaven, but would be satisfied with a pain-free
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   heaven without him there, we don't receive him, we use him.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:57.500]   Saving faith means receiving Jesus as our supreme treasure.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.100]   That kind of affection for Jesus is not peripheral add-on.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.540]   That's what saving faith is.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:12.020]   And I would just plead with those who are quick to pass judgment on such views that
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:20.700]   they too not be satisfied with words, but press in to the meaning and the reality and
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:28.660]   the real heart experiences of what it is to really embrace Jesus Christ in saving
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.060]   faith.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.180]   Amen.
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.020]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.140]   That's exactly right.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:39.540]   We must receive Christ not only as our rescuer, not only as our master, but as
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.140]   our supreme treasure above all things.
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.780]   So good.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:12.620]   Well, both Paul and Moses say they would rather be damned and let others be saved
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.060]   by way of a trade.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.660]   So doesn't this imply that their vision of mission was a higher priority in their
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.380]   lives than their personal and eternal joy in the presence of God?
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:31.420]   In other words, didn't Paul and Moses prioritize mission over their joy in God?
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.940]   Wow.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.580]   You guys come up with some really good and hard questions.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:37.700]   I'm your host Tony Ranke.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.180]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   Have a great weekend.
