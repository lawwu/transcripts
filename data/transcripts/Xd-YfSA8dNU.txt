[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.860]   Pastor John, several listeners have emailed to ask this question, "How far is too far
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.100]   for an engaged couple to go sexually before marriage?"
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.740]   It's a really important question.
[00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.140]   Our culture is, of course, awash in sexual titillation.
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.060]   You can hardly open your internet without some advertisement on the side, awakening
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.100]   some sexual desire, or watch an advertisement between a TV program, or go to any movie almost
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.740]   without some kind of titillation.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.020]   It's really amazing what we're having to deal with these days.
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.980]   When a young man and a young woman, or older man and older woman for that matter, begin
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.020]   to hang out together, what should they do physically is utterly crucial to ask.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.700]   The Bible is our guide and our authority.
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.500]   It does not have a single sentence somewhere that says, "Okay, engaged couples.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.980]   Okay, couples that are starting to date.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.340]   Here's what you can and can't do."
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.100]   The way we have to approach it is by putting together truths from the Bible, which when
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.900]   they come together, lead to some conclusions.
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.340]   Let me try to put together a few of those.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.740]   I'll see if I can be brief here.
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.340]   Number one, sex is good.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.620]   I don't want to start with mainly, "Oh, bad, bad, bad.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.620]   Watch out.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.620]   Watch out."
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.500]   Sex is good.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.820]   First Timothy 4.3, the days are coming when people are going to forbid to eat certain things
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.140]   and marry because marriage has got that ugly stuff called sex in it.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.060]   Paul says, "No, the food and the sex are created to be received with thanksgiving because they're
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.820]   sanctified by the word of God and prayer," which surprisingly really says good sex is
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.300]   for Christians, because people who will give thanks for it.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.660]   Husbands and wives, give your conjugal rights, 1 Corinthians 7.3.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.340]   Only abstain from this sexual thing briefly, lest Satan tempt you, which means, by the
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.060]   way, that it's not just for having babies.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.620]   It's got other deeper personal satisfaction reasons that God put it in our lives.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.620]   Of course, the amazing text that all men love from Proverbs 5.19, "Rejoice in the wife of
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.420]   your youth and let her breasts fill you with delight."
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.940]   Clearly, sexual touching is a good thing, biblically.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.940]   That's number one.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.300]   Number two, sex is to be enjoyed only in marriage.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.060]   1 Corinthians 6.18, "Flee from pornia," that is, from fornication, from sexual immorality.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.060]   There's a difference between pornia and moikia.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.660]   Moikia is adultery and pornia is fornication.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.900]   There is illicit sex in marriage called adultery and there's illicit sex before marriage called
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.900]   fornication.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.700]   Don't go there.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.580]   Flee from it, Paul says.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.020]   1 Corinthians 7.9, "If they can't exercise self-control, they should marry," because
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.500]   this phenomenon, this wonderful thing called sex, is designed to be satisfied in marriage.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.700]   One of the reasons for that is that physical union, sexual intercourse, is meant to be
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.300]   the physical capstone of an emotional, spiritual union in lasting covenant.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.740]   We're not animals.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.980]   Sex has roots and branches penetrating in all of our being and it affects all of our
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.980]   being.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.860]   We've tried to abstract sex from the covenantal, deep, personal, emotional, spiritual union
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.180]   of a man and a woman in our movies, in our literature, in our advertising, and it's wreaking
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.180]   havoc all over the world.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.300]   Women in particular are more whole than men in this regard.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.380]   Women are wired to want more plainly than men the holistic dimension of sexuality.
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:21.020]   You don't want to be treated like mere animals for men's animalistic satisfaction.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.380]   They want a relationship.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.620]   They want this thing to have personal dimensions and covenantal commitment dimensions.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.740]   It's so sad to watch so many women in the media be drawn by the demands of men into
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.220]   a more animalistic way of treating sex than in this holistic, personal way.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.540]   Marriage is where God means for that beautiful, whole commitment and covenantal, deep, personal,
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.180]   spiritual reality with a capstone of sexual intercourse to happen.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.740]   The third observation is that mental sex is meant for marriage.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.300]   Jesus said everyone who looks upon a woman to desire her has already committed adultery
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:19.580]   with her in his heart, which means that doing sex in your mind, looking at a woman and cultivating
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.260]   through some fantasy a way that you get into bed with her or take off her clothes is not
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.260]   supposed to happen.
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.860]   You're supposed to gouge out your eye rather than let that happen because that's meant
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.860]   for marriage.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.660]   You're supposed to have mental sex in marriage as well as physical sex in marriage.
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.460]   So those are the first three biblical observations.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.740]   Here's an experience observation to put with those before we draw some conclusions.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:59.220]   Sexual touching is designed by God and experienced by most healthy people as prelude to sexual
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.220]   intercourse.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.580]   That's what it's for.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.460]   It's extremely frustrating to start touching sexually and have to break it off as the passions
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.740]   become strong because those touchings and that passion is meant to take you all the
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.740]   way.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.740]   God designed it that way.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.900]   It's called foreplay for a reason.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:28.660]   Here's some implications.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:49.380]   Don't put yourself in a situation where there's an awakening of the desire to go
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380]   further and further.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:07:00.420]   So my principle would be avoid sexually awakening, touching and kissing.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.860]   They are designed as foreplay, not play.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.900]   I think to be specific, I think that would mean virtually universally touching breasts,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   touching genitals.
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.900]   It's in that category.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:22.540]   I can't imagine any normal person saying, "Touching breasts and touching genitals is
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.860]   just not sexual for us.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.100]   It's not going anywhere."
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.980]   That's just crazy.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.740]   It was designed to go somewhere and it's a beautiful thing if you're in the situation
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.940]   of marriage where it can go somewhere.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:44.780]   So when the symphony is for marriage, the part of the symphony called prelude is for
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.620]   marriage.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.420]   I would just suggest very practically that men and women getting into a relationship
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.100]   that they think is going to be serious, that they talk about this with each other and that
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:05.100]   they decide for themselves how they're not going to tempt each other to have sexually
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.860]   awakening, touching and kissing.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:15.540]   I would specifically tell you I would plead with men here, "Be strong here and set a
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.500]   pure and holy pattern.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.900]   Don't make her be the one to bring it up or to put on the brakes.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.660]   Lead her in purity.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.620]   She'll love you for it and in due time, she will give herself to you in a more complete
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:37.180]   and beautiful and whole way because you've prized her enough not to use her in an unbiblical,
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.020]   sinful way."
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:45.060]   I would say to the women, "Don't entice a man to touch you thinking that this is the
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.620]   way to keep a man.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.100]   He's not worth keeping if that's the way he's kept."
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.180]   Feel free to say to any man, "No, don't please.
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.420]   Don't take us there."
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.220]   You can discern what kind of a man you're dealing with by how sensitive he is to that
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.300]   dimension of purity.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.420]   Blessed are the pure in heart.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420]   They will see God.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.060]   That's what we want.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:18.260]   We want to see God and we want to see him in our beautiful sexual relations in marriage.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.940]   I think married couples who have been the purest also can have the sweetest and best
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:31.100]   experience of each other and experience of God in marriage.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   One last word.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.460]   If a single person is listening to this saying, "Oh, very nice.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.740]   I'm not married.
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.260]   There's nobody on the horizon.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.260]   What am I supposed to do?"
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.940]   I just want to say one thing.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.060]   Don't feel second class.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:54.860]   Jesus Christ is the most complete human being who ever lived and he never had sex.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.100]   Not to be married and not to have sex is not to be an incomplete human being.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:08.860]   One can be the completest and most fruitful and whole human being like Jesus without having
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.860]   sex.
