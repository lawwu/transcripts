[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, last Wednesday we looked at what makes Pastor John tick.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   There he gave us a glimpse into his ministry and his aims.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   That was APJ 1769.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   In today's clip, I return to that same sermon because he goes from that point
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   of what makes him tick in ministry to talking about how God makes much of us,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   his children, and why he makes much of us, his children.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   First, the point to clearly state it, God makes much of us.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   He does, and he does so beyond our wildest imaginations.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   In fact, we'll see that point next week in greater detail, how God makes much of us.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   So hold that thought for now because here in this Wednesday sermon clip,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I want you to see that, yes, God makes much of us,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   but his plan aims at something far greater than merely making us feel loved
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   for the sake of making us feel loved.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   You'll see why here in just a moment.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Again, as we dive into this sermon clip for context,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   this comes from a sermon preached two weeks out from John Piper's eight-month
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   leave of absence from his church in 2010.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   These are part of his parting words, so to speak, to his church, and in them,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   here's Pastor John to explain how God makes much of us and why he does it this way.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   My shorthand way of trying to help the nominal Christian wake up to their real condition
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and then plead for regeneration, plead for an awakening,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   so that at the bottom of their souls is Jesus and not self,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   is to say, "Do you feel more loved by God when he makes much of you,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   or do you feel more loved by God when at great cost to his son,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   he frees you from that horrible bondage to self in order to enjoy making much of him forever
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   so that the peak of your joy is see him, savor him, show him?"
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now, all that's introduction.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Today, I am really jealous that this concern of mine that I just described
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   not undermine the immeasurable way that God loves you,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   including his making much of you.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He makes more of you, Christian, true, born-again, struggling Christian,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   he makes more of you than you ever dreamed he could or would.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I want you to see and feel that you are more loved by God when he loves you that way
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   than any other way.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He makes more of you when he makes much of you for his sake
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   than if he were to make much of you only for your sake.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't preach this sermon.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   God is making more of you when he makes much of you for his sake
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   than if he only made much of you for your sake.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   More is being made of you, and I hope to show you that.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I argued, I mean, I said that God reveals himself relentlessly in the Bible
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   as loving you for his namesake.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Let me give you just a few examples so that those of you who may not be as familiar
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   with this as others will get on board with me.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You'll know, "What are you saying?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What do you mean by that?"
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I'm going to give you four or five examples.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Number one, God shows his love for us by predestining us for adoption
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   into his family.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I don't--every one of these feels like the greatest act of love to me.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I want to say, "This is the greatest."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Well, it's probably--I want to reserve that for the cross, I think,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   but, man, this is big.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   That God in eternity looked upon me foreseeing my fallenness, my pride,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   my sin, and said, "I want that man in my family.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'll do anything to get him in my family.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I will pay for him to be in my family with my son's life."
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's love, folks.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That is mega, off-the-charts love.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And the verse is Ephesians 1, 6.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   "He predestined us for adoption as sons to Jesus Christ."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Get that?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   "He predestined us for adoption into the divine, universe-ruling family
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of his glorious grace."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Does that ruin it?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Does that ruin it?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   No.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   He did it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He said, "I'm going to have John Piper.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I'm going to have you in my family.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I've decided this before the world is created.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I'm having you to the praise of the glory of my grace."
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I hope that doesn't ruin it for you.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I want to make it more, more, not less, that he did it for his glory.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Number two, God shows his love for us by creating us.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   If we didn't have existence, we couldn't enjoy him or anything else.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   So he loved us into being.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Why?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Isaiah 43, 6, "Bring my sons from afar, my daughters from the ends of the earth,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Don't let that diminish the love of God for you and your creation,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that you came into being for his glory.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Number three, God shows his love for us by sending us a savior, the angels.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   which will be for all the people.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   For unto you this day in the city of David is born a savior,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   who is Christ the Lord, and this will be a sign for you.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You will find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly foes
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   A savior's come."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Does that bother you, that they would sing that way?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Instead of saying, "Glory to the men for whom he's dying.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Glory to the women for whom he's dying."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Instead, they sing, "Glory to God.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   A savior came to rescue sinners.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   God, God, God, what a God."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I just want you to get inside this so bad.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We get the savior, he gets the glory.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   We get the great joy, he gets the honor.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Is that okay?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Goodnight, that's okay.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It can't be any other way if there's a God and a sinner like me.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It can't be any other way.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   This is the greatest news in all the world.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   A savior has come for me, and the angels are praising God.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Number four, God shows his love for us when Christ died.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   This is probably the biggest, isn't it?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   In the Bible, that the death of Christ is the biggest display of the love of God.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Let me give you just one verse.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   This is 2 Corinthians 5:14.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   "The love of Christ controls us because we have concluded this,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   that one has died for all, therefore all have died.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And he died for all."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Here comes the purpose clause.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   "So that those who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   but for him who for their sakes died and was raised."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Christ died for me.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He put himself between me and the bullet, me and the sword, me and the flames,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   and he took it, though I deserved it, and he didn't.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   He took it, and he did that
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   so that I might no longer live for my magnificent self
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and would now die and enjoy living for him forever.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's why he did it.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   That's love.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's a bigger love than if he hadn't done it that way.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Number five, and it's this verse.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   It's verse 9 in Psalm 79.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "Help us, O God, of our salvation for the glory of your name.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Deliver us and atone for us, for our sins, for your name's sake."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Born-again people pray like that.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   "Save me for your name's sake.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Deliver me, atone for my sin, for your name's sake."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   That's the way born-again people think.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's all going back.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   It's all going back.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Every grace that comes to me is being reflected back, and I love it!
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I love it!
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   That's why I'm alive.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's just the greatest thing in all the world
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   that I would be rescued from immersion in Piper.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Yuck!
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   To be freed a little bit, a little bit,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and just know him and love him and give it all back
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and let him be God for me.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So good.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   That 2 Corinthians 5:15 text is really stunning, isn't it?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "Christ died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   but for him who for their sake died and was raised."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Incredible.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Christ died to save me from me.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   This is from John Piper's April 18, 2010 sermon on Psalm 79,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   titled "How Much Does God Love This Church?"
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   The whole thing is online.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I found this clip.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   If you find one, email it to me.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and make a note of what stands out to you in the clip.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Well, Friday we're back to talk about the pursuit of holiness as justified believers,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   something we must get right.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Does God delight in our justification, our imputed righteousness,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   or does God delight in our actual lived-out righteousness, our holiness?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   It's a really super important question, and that is up next time.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we are joined in studio with Pastor John
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   when we return on Friday for that.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   [ Silence ]
