[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   are you tempted to just go to these really smart 15 year olds
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   a hall pass to the library all day and some Wi-Fi access and then just leave them
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.280]   alone
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.920]   or do you think that they need some sort of structure? I think they need some
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.640]   structure but you have to let them rebel against it
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.720]   and do their own thing also. Zero structure strikes me
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   as great for a few of them but even for the super talented ones it's not perfect
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.680]   they need exposure to things and they need some teachers as role models
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.400]   so you want them to have some structure. And if you read old books about education
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820]   there's a strong emphasis on moral instruction. Do you think that needs to be
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120]   an important part of education or is that just...
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.640]   I'd like to see more data but I suspect the best moral instruction
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.920]   is the teachers actually being good people and
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.720]   I think that works but again I'd like to see the data but that somehow you get up
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.200]   and lecture them about the seven virtues or something
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.920]   seems to me a waste of time and maybe even counterproductive
