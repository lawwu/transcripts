[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   [silence]
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.160]   I love to exercise.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.720]   I know to some people this might seem foreign,
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.400]   but I love to exercise.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.780]   I love to do resistance training.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.400]   I love to run.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.080]   I am not one of those people
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   that doesn't like the experience of exercising,
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.480]   but likes the feeling afterwards, quote unquote.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.320]   I hear that a lot.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.280]   I don't like to exercise,
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.880]   but I love the way I feel afterwards.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.840]   I love physical training,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.000]   and I love the way I feel afterwards,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.840]   but I mostly love the feeling during.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.680]   I don't know why I'm wired that way.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.300]   I can't say that I'm somebody
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.840]   who likes to do hard things across the board.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.440]   There are plenty of difficult things in life that I dread
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.840]   or that I'm sort of meh about,
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.620]   but for me, hard exercise, intense exercise
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560]   of a particular kind, resistance training
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.360]   and running in particular, both give me a yum, yes.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.800]   I love this kind of feeling.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.540]   And yes, it persists for me quite a long while afterwards,
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.000]   both for sake of the way that it changes my neurochemistry,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.480]   but also my sense of satisfaction,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.720]   but I just simply love it.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.600]   Now, years ago, I discovered that if I drink
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.320]   a cup of black coffee or an Americano or a double espresso
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.920]   or some yerba mate,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.200]   that my workouts can be quite a bit more intense.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.720]   I can run further.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.280]   And then I also discovered
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.460]   that if I were to take a pre-workout energy drink,
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.040]   or I took, say, 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.160]   and 500 milligrams of phenolethylamine,
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.060]   and perhaps even 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.080]   and perhaps did that alongside the caffeine
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.700]   and the yerba mate, then yes, absolutely.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.300]   I really liked those workouts.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.480]   I could be like a laser in terms of focus.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.740]   I could exert even more effort, put on some music,
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.180]   and I could achieve even better performance.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.140]   And then I also discovered that I could export
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.840]   that protocol of caffeine, yerba mate,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.720]   and various supplements to my cognitive work.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.640]   So when I was studying or writing papers
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.760]   or writing grants or in the laboratory,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.320]   when I was doing experiments with my hands in those days,
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.720]   cutting brain tissue and staining it
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.200]   and working really long hours,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.440]   and I discovered that all of those things,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   all of those behaviors compounded with my love of exercise
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.560]   and my love of doing science
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.120]   and gave me these big peaks in what, to me,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.520]   felt like even important experiences.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.040]   They felt, you know, unlike anything else.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   They were just so, so peak in their nature,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.800]   which was great, and it did indeed enhance my performance.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.700]   However, while it did not create a dependency
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.040]   for those different substances,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.280]   caffeine, supplements, et cetera,
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280]   what I noticed was that in the days
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.820]   and sometimes weekends afterwards,
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.340]   even though for much of my career,
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.300]   I confess I've worked weekends as well,
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.060]   but I would notice that I'd experience
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760]   a real trough in energy.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.680]   I just would not feel that good.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.580]   And then if I kept up those behaviors consistently
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.240]   and I was consistently adding in these other,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.960]   let's just call them what they are, dopamine-releasing
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640]   or stimulating behaviors and substances,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.520]   that my enthusiasm for physical training or running
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.480]   or for doing experiments actually started to diminish.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360]   And this was really discouraging to me at the time
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240]   because I started to think, okay, maybe I'm burnt out.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.480]   Maybe I have adrenal burnout,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.040]   which by the way, doesn't exist, folks.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.360]   Your adrenals don't burn out.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.760]   There is something called adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.920]   You can overstimulate your system
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.600]   by way of too much adrenaline, epinephrine,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.960]   and norepinephrine, but that's a separate thing.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.000]   There's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   but I didn't know that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.580]   So I thought, gosh, I'm really burnt out.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.360]   When in fact, it's now obvious to me what I was doing.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.240]   I was combining too many dopamine-releasing
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.920]   or stimulating behaviors and substances
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.800]   for things that I already enjoy doing as behaviors,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.440]   namely exercise and doing experiments,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.960]   anything related to science, actually.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.800]   So what this means is not to avoid taking things
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.120]   or doing things that amplify your amount of dopamine,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   but to be very cautious about how often one does that
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.240]   and how many different dopamine-stimulating behaviors
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.080]   or compounds one stacks,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.960]   especially in terms of taking those things
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.480]   or stacking those things in and around behaviors
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240]   that you already really enjoy doing.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.060]   I was essentially just creating another version
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.720]   of the kids in nursery school or first grade
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.320]   with the Gold Star experiment.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   I was basically just doing the exact same thing.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.520]   And when I realized that and I changed my relationship
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.660]   to those compounds, I didn't eliminate them altogether,
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.140]   but I started realizing, for instance,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.920]   that I didn't need to double up on yerba mate
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.740]   and coffee every workout.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.280]   Sometimes I would do one, sometimes I would do the other.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.400]   Frankly, I always do one or the other.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.760]   It's rare that I ever do any kind of physical training
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.080]   without some caffeine first.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.880]   And I do my physical training typically
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.340]   in the early part of the day, so that's fine.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.520]   It doesn't interfere with my sleep.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.260]   I might do a hike without caffeine,
[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.760]   but if I'm in a weight trainer, I'm going to run.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.620]   I tend to drink coffee beforehand or have yerba mate.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.320]   Or if I occasionally, meaning about once every third,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.580]   sometimes every other,
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.120]   but usually about every third workout,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.220]   I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.080]   Maybe occasionally, maybe every third or fourth workout.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.240]   And these are resistance workouts, mind you, not running.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.200]   I'll take 500 milligrams of l-tyrosine
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.640]   or more typically 500 milligrams of phenolethylamine.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.520]   And very, very rarely, maybe once every two or three months,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.420]   I might stack all of those things together
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.840]   prior to a workout.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.620]   But of course, I'm always mindful to also include workouts
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.200]   or runs or bouts of cognitive work.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   So that could be grant writing, prepping for a podcast,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.100]   et cetera, where I don't do anything prior.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.360]   Maybe just my caffeine because I have a baseline level
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.640]   of caffeine that I use each day to function.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.380]   Like many people, there's a baseline level of caffeine
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.120]   that just allows us to function
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.720]   if we're a perpetual user of caffeine.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   I talked a lot about this on the episode in caffeine.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.880]   But the key here is be cautious.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.560]   I would say be very cautious about stacking and layering
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.680]   in too many dopamine peak inducing behaviors
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.920]   all at once on a regular basis.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.880]   The key point here is if you are somebody
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.040]   that can engage in these intrinsically joyful activities
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.020]   for you, these activities that you're really motivated
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.980]   to do, whether or not it's skiing or playing music
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.640]   or dancing, et cetera, without the need to layer
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.280]   in additional dopamine releasing mechanisms
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.900]   or compounds or activities,
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.040]   well then I highly recommend you do that
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.160]   because then you are essentially making yourself
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.000]   one of those fortunate few
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.560]   that does not require additional stimuli
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.400]   and therefore can hold onto that pleasure,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.840]   can hold onto that intrinsic pleasure and motivation
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.980]   to engage in these behaviors over time,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.200]   which frankly there is no replacement for.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   There is no pill or bottle or potion or motivational speech
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   or podcast or book that can replace intrinsic motivation.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.520]   Intrinsic motivation is perhaps the holy grail
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920]   of all human endeavors and behaviors
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.200]   because it encompasses so much of what brought us
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.040]   to this point in our species evolution.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.960]   And also what brings each and every one of us
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   closer and closer to our goals.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.480]   And if it's happening with enjoyment
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.060]   without the need to layer in additional tools,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.300]   well then you have really tapped into the source.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.340]   And when I say the source,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.460]   I don't mean in any kind of mystical way.
[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.300]   I think it's quite clear by now
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.420]   that when we hear about chi from Eastern medicine
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.260]   or we talk about motivation, drive, and pursuit
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.820]   in Western neurobiological languages that relates to dopamine
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.500]   or we hear about the source,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.940]   maybe in my podcast episode with the one and only
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.060]   Rick Rubin, incredibly productive music producer
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.460]   who's has just an unbelievable track record
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.860]   in terms of creative endeavors.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.180]   And he talks about the source.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.540]   We're really talking about the same thing,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.820]   which is this set of circuits within us
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.100]   that allow us to identify what we want
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.580]   and then lean into effort.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.780]   And then to do that in a persistent way
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.140]   that allows us to reach our goals.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.420]   And if we can do that with an intrinsic sense of pleasure,
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.540]   well, that is nothing short of magic.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.120]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.540]   [upbeat music]
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.600]   you
