[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   - Josh Kronke, fellow Columbia Missourian.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.080]   - We're a rare breed up here.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.400]   - We are a rare breed.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.080]   - I did an internship right out of school
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.320]   with the NBA league office.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.800]   Our group was in charge of the rookie transition program.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.680]   - Did you hear what happened to me
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.680]   at the rookie transition camp in New York?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.320]   - Was this the one where you posted Adam Silver's number?
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.160]   - Yeah.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.720]   I thought I was gonna get kicked out the league.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   - This comparison comes through
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.360]   and it's player A and player B.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.080]   Player B's numbers were better in really every category.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.040]   I was like, I'm gonna guess that player B is Nikola.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.760]   And they're like, yep, you're right.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.600]   And I'm like, all right,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800]   well then who are we talking about with player A?
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.840]   Is this some sort of comparison with Nurk
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.360]   or is this some sort of comparison
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.240]   with someone else in the league?
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.240]   And they're like, player A is Larry Bird.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080]   (laughing)
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.480]   And I was like, oh.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440]   All of us kind of looked at each other like,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.360]   because you know, sometimes when you talk
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.040]   to like a basketball purist even,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.640]   Nikola's, his skill set and the way that he plays,
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.920]   you know, the eye test,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.480]   he doesn't jump out at you right away.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.560]   - There's a lot of talk about his number, number 15,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.480]   and you know, him and Carmelo Anthony.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.500]   You know, it's not anything that really ever crossed our mind.
