[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   - Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.320]   This episode was jointly hosted
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.720]   by the Tampa Bay and South Florida Chapters
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.040]   and recorded April 27th, 2021.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.640]   It features Mark Zorrel, PlanVision's founder
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.760]   and colleague, Jason Lynch, discussing a variety of topics.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.880]   Bogleheads are investors
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.160]   who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.800]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.280]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.780]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.360]   Alrighty, so welcome everybody
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.780]   to the Tampa Bay and South Florida Chapters joint meeting.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.520]   We're pleased to have Mark Zorrel,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.400]   the founder of PlanVision, joining us this evening
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.760]   along with his colleague, Jason Lynch, CPA,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160]   and they're gonna be presenting two topics.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400]   We'll take time following each of the topics
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.240]   for question and answer sessions.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.360]   And without further ado,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480]   I'll turn this over to Mark and Jason.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.120]   - Great, thanks, Alan.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.480]   By the way, I started PlanVision in 2012,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.720]   even if it seems like it's been 20 years now.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.560]   - Okay.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.560]   - So I have a list of eight different topics
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480]   or subjects that we're gonna go through
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.000]   as we talk about the considerations
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.880]   in instructing your investments before and after retirement.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.200]   Really, it's not necessarily just the investments,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   it's the whole idea of planning and preparing for retirement.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.760]   What are some of the important considerations
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.580]   that you would go through?
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.200]   And then we'll talk about the technology as well.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100]   But I, Jason is involved in these as well.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.720]   I do, at this point, about 17 retirement plans a week.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.040]   And so these concepts that we're gonna go through
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.080]   are very much a part of not all the reviews
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.240]   that I do and we do with our clients, but many of them.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.960]   So very relevant concepts that we go through.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   So we'll just get started with the first one,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   and that is how to think about your healthcare costs
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.840]   as you approach retirement.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.360]   Because this is one that seemingly scares so many folks.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.120]   First of all, I wanna go through how you will buy healthcare
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.900]   or how you can shop for that or think about.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.040]   When you turn 65, you will be eligible for Medicare,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960]   for the most part, unless you're working for an employer
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.000]   and have some employer coverage,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   or maybe you have coverage through the military.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.880]   But you'll buy a Medicare supplement.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.060]   But many people retire pre-65,
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.920]   and a lot of people have not shopped
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.720]   for healthcare on their own.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.360]   They've got it through their employer in the past,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.720]   and they're just used to the process of getting it that way,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.920]   or maybe through their spouse's plan.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.440]   But when you're going to start buying healthcare
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.320]   on your own, a few of the options that you have,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.840]   the first one, or for many people,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.760]   is they can buy COBRA through their employer.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.840]   So that is the option where you can get healthcare
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440]   as an extension of your employment
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440]   with your employer that you left.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   You can buy it and pay the employer side of that.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.040]   Many people are familiar with that
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440]   and will elect to go with that.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.520]   On the other hand, and many people,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.820]   at least some of the people that we worked with,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.600]   are not familiar with how to buy healthcare on their own.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.440]   They haven't done that before.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.660]   Depending upon the state that you live in,
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.600]   your state may offer an exchange.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.040]   We have one of those in Minnesota,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.440]   and I've been buying my healthcare since 2012
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.840]   on the exchange.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   So I go there and I shop for healthcare.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.320]   Or you can buy it on the federal exchange, I believe.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   There's some states that do not offer a state exchange.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.640]   But anyways, you go on there, you shop for it.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.040]   I think in most cases,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.920]   eligibility is in November, December for the following year.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.280]   Anyways, the important point about this
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.360]   is that it's worth your time.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   And if you're going to be going out,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.320]   if you're going to be retiring
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.760]   and no longer get employer-sponsored healthcare,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.960]   it's worth your time if you've just assumed
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.220]   that you will use your employer's coverage
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.880]   to shop for healthcare on the exchange
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.380]   in the state that you live in.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.700]   Now, it is likely that many people will say,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.120]   oh, but it's expensive.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.560]   Yes, it's likely going to be costly,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.200]   particularly for those folks that will say things like,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.440]   gosh, I've had great coverage for years,
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.720]   and they've been paying a small premium,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.000]   or just haven't had to pay that much.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.420]   It may be a bit of a sticker shock
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.400]   when they actually have to shop for their own healthcare.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.960]   On the other hand, what has developed the last several years
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.100]   with the Affordable Care Act is that many people,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.780]   even those people that have significant wealth
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.560]   will qualify for an ACA subsidy.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.200]   And what that means is that instead of buying
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.240]   or using COBRA insurance from your prior employer,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.040]   you may save quite a bit of money
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.220]   by buying your healthcare through the exchange.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.140]   The federal government offers a subsidy
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.720]   on the premium that you pay.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.000]   So I wanted to raise that as a point
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that we discuss with our clients.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.220]   And we certainly have come across people
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.380]   who are very experienced investors,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.160]   have done a good job of planning,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.440]   but just simply weren't knowledgeable
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   about how to shop for healthcare,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.380]   and didn't even realize that the ACA subsidy was available.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.420]   So that would be the first point
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.540]   that I would want to mention as you think about
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.740]   the transition for retirement upcoming
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.420]   is how do you want to get
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.900]   or where do you want to get your healthcare from?
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.020]   And a great place to go to,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.540]   to get an idea of how much it's going to cost
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.060]   is just go to your state's website.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.720]   And you can log in and you can price out some,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.580]   you can price out some of the premiums
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.580]   that will be available.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.560]   Now I've been buying it for years, as I mentioned,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.300]   and I buy a high deductible plan,
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   which means my out-of-pocket deductible is up to $13,000.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.340]   And those are the least expensive policies.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.900]   So, and for many of the people that we work with
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.100]   that have accumulated wealth,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.680]   they're going to want to buy a high deductible policy.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.820]   So that's the first consideration.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.860]   Now, at this point, I wanted Jason to provide some thoughts
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.420]   and he's got, he does a wonderful job with our clients
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.780]   in going through how they may qualify for the ACA premium
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.980]   and some of the tax implications from that.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.980]   - Right, okay, thanks, Mark.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.200]   So, right, Mark alluded to, if you're shopping insurance,
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.580]   you may want to take a look on the, you know,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.220]   the healthcare marketplace.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.140]   Because the ACA premium subsidy,
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.420]   the premium tax credit as it's known,
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.880]   had been capped for households that earn,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   that have income of over 400% of federal poverty level.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.100]   If you're over that threshold,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.700]   the ACA credit disappears completely instead of a phase out.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.900]   That is known as the ACA subsidy cliff, and it's dramatic.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.580]   You could get a subsidy if you're within
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.140]   the income threshold.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.420]   And if you go $100 over that limit,
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.140]   you don't get the credit anymore at all.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.100]   You've fallen off the cliff.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.540]   So, for a two-person household,
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.860]   that amount is about $69,000.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.320]   A four-person goes up to about $104,000.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.140]   And as Mark mentioned, some clients,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.020]   some people that have wealth,
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.820]   don't have a lot of high income.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.540]   They don't have much income anymore
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.820]   because they've retired now
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.660]   and they're managing their cash flow.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.140]   Now, it's important to note that the American Rescue Plan,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.140]   the plan that was signed last month,
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.740]   removes that cliff and it simply caps
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.220]   marketplace health insurance premiums
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.220]   at no more than 8.5% of household income in 2021 and 2022.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.060]   Okay, great, but what does that mean?
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.780]   What that means is, if your household income
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.780]   is already more than 400% of federal poverty level, FPL,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.220]   for a household of four people,
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.300]   if the benchmark plan premium in your area,
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.300]   in your zip code, is less than 8.5% of your income,
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.700]   you won't qualify for the credit anyway,
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.060]   regardless if there was a cliff or not.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.820]   But, if the benchmark plan in your area
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.220]   is greater than 8.5% of your income,
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.940]   you're now eligible for the credit.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.140]   And this will benefit many people
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.020]   who might not have otherwise been able
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.020]   to take advantage of it, and here's why.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.180]   In the great state of Michigan, in Monroe, Michigan,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.180]   in my zip code, 48166, a 54-year-old couple,
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:50.260]   both 54, with 120,000 modified AGI for this purpose,
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.100]   would get a monthly credit of $230.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.480]   Okay, not a huge amount, 2,800 for the year.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.900]   But, their friends in Bloomington, Illinois,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.340]   zip code 61701, they're identical.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.060]   They modified AGI, would get a monthly credit of $951,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.580]   which is almost 12 grand.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.580]   But, their cousins, who live in Charleston, West Virginia,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.580]   also have $120,000 modified AGI,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.020]   would get a monthly credit of $1,500,
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.780]   almost $19,000 against their premium.
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.820]   It's all, now, I cherry-picked these, of course.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.100]   These are all based on your zip code,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.380]   and I've been using, it's called
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.760]   the healthinsurance.org calculator,
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.900]   and we'll be able to have show notes for that,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.100]   so that you can look at it.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.600]   So, the main thing I wanna make here, the main point,
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.820]   is that don't assume that this premium tax credit
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.820]   doesn't apply to you, and that's for 2021 and 2022.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.660]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.580]   Thanks, Jason.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.460]   Yeah, it's, I guess, a weird outcome of this law
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.220]   that we have clients with five, $8 million,
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.300]   they're getting a subsidy on their healthcare premium.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.780]   Moving on to the next topic,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.460]   I'm gonna discuss how to think about withdrawing money
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.680]   from your account.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.140]   - Mark and Jason, if I could,
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.700]   we have a hand-raiser, Jody M.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.020]   - Okay. - Has their hand raised,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.260]   if they have a question.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.420]   - And so...
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.460]   - No.
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.680]   Folks, unless there's something that's really critical,
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.740]   relevant to what they're talking about,
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.380]   let's try to hold questions until after they're done
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.180]   with a segment of the presentation.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.500]   - Okay, I'll go ahead and move on.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.420]   So the second segment I was gonna talk about
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.260]   was how to think about taking money out of your account.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.500]   And certainly a lot of people will think,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.100]   well, gosh, I spent all my life accumulating this money,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.940]   how am I gonna live off this?
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.420]   And this can intimidate people.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.180]   So I'm gonna talk about some considerations
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.340]   on your investments and how to structure those,
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.080]   and then a bit of just the mechanics
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.500]   of how you go about doing it.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.180]   First of all, when I work with our clients
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.660]   and we talk about the structure of their assets,
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.940]   I basically break down their assets
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.100]   into three different compartments.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.820]   One would be their, what we call their qualified money,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.820]   IRAs, 401ks, 457 deferred comp, that is pre-tax.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.320]   Any money that they have, which is tax-free,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.540]   and some people have pretty large Roth IRAs,
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.780]   or they plan on doing Roth conversions,
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.700]   that's the other bucket.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.460]   Then the final one would be their brokerage accounts.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.900]   And I would throw cash in there as well.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.700]   So the way that I view how they will invest
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.580]   or allocate their money is when are they gonna need
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.540]   to take that money out?
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.120]   For many people, it is likely going to be wise,
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.540]   and of course, these are generalizations.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.340]   It's likely going to be wise for them
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.180]   to take money out of their brokerage account
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.620]   and their cash first and allow their Roth IRA
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.700]   and their qualified money to grow tax-free
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.000]   or tax-deferred longer.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.700]   For many people also, one thing about their Roth money,
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.220]   depending upon how their plan looks,
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.560]   their Roth money is money they're never going to touch.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.180]   Now, they may end up using it,
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.280]   but for many of them, it can just be a part of their estate.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.860]   They just have enough of their assets
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.820]   where they're not gonna need to dip into their Roth money.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.180]   And then the retirement money or the qualified money
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.660]   may be somewhere in between.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.220]   They may start taking the retirement money out
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.300]   in three years, seven years, 10 years.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.020]   They may not take it out
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.780]   until their required minimum distributions
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.700]   that begin at age 72 at this point.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.540]   So an important concept when you think about that
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.180]   is when I think about the investments for my clients,
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.260]   'cause that's what Bogleheads think about,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.460]   is, oh, I gotta have the perfect asset allocation
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.260]   or otherwise I can't sleep at night.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.420]   So a lot of times what they do
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.860]   is they'll look at their portfolio as a whole,
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.020]   and that kind of drives, I mean, personally,
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.420]   it drives me like nuts to think that way
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.480]   'cause then you have to massage these portfolios
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.660]   to get the right percentage,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.880]   and this account, and so on.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.540]   So I've evolved in my thinking a little bit
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.740]   where I would focus more on the compartment of money
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.100]   and how soon are you going to need to access that money.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.100]   So my point would be, if you have a Roth and an HSA,
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.940]   and you may use your HSA really as a long-term plan,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.860]   and that's gonna be long-term,
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.060]   then you may want to just have that be 100% in stocks
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.540]   if you're comfortable with that.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.020]   Really, regardless of the size of the Roth.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.740]   The retirement assets,
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.340]   if they're going to be the second in line,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.020]   you can still be maybe relatively aggressive with that,
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.380]   whatever that means to you.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.780]   If that's 90/10, 80/20, 70/30,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.460]   some asset allocation mix like that.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.940]   And we do plans with retirees
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.180]   where they're retiring at 55, 58, 62,
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.420]   and it's clear from their plan
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.060]   that they're not gonna need to take their money out
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.900]   to RMDs, and then when they get to the RMDs,
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.560]   they're only taking it out 'cause they have to.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.100]   So they can still afford, if they're comfortable,
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.200]   to be relatively aggressive with their qualified money.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.820]   So then that just leaves their cash
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.920]   or their brokerage account.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.680]   And that is money that, frankly,
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.540]   I would encourage my clients to think seriously
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.320]   about how aggressive they wanna be with that money,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.480]   because that's money they may end up relying
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.260]   or using fairly soon.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.700]   So the point about this that I'm making is,
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.820]   if you think of the money in your brokerage account,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.620]   and I know this is somewhat heresy to some bogo heads,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.920]   is that you might wanna actually have that in bonds
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.700]   or more stable-oriented assets.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.220]   I know it's not tax-efficient,
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.980]   but still you've gotta think through
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.820]   when would you take the money out?
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.180]   And so I think that's an important consideration
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.500]   for people that are getting close to the point
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.080]   where they're going to start drawing on the money,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.660]   because that's how I kind of think of their assets
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.560]   is the different compartments that they can take money from.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.940]   So that was something I wanted to talk about
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.860]   when we think about withdrawing money.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.100]   Now, another area is just,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.180]   there are a lot of people that actually don't know
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.820]   how they're gonna take money out from their accounts.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.660]   And it has gotten to be relatively simple.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.220]   We'll talk a little bit about this on the technology area
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.140]   or how we think technology is gonna impact things.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.480]   But yeah, you can have, if you have mutual funds,
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.180]   you can get set up for automatic distributions on those
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.720]   where they come out every monthly,
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   or you can do them once a year or twice a year or quarterly.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.080]   And you can just have the money sent
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.600]   right to your bank account.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.720]   So when you think of taking money out of your account,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.800]   it is actually really simple to do that these days.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.960]   I find that my clients, as they get older,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   they tend to want to simplify things.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.440]   And so they'll just say,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.080]   "Look, just send me the money in January or whatever.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.600]   I don't care if it's too much or whatever the case may be."
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.720]   Jason, do you have any thoughts
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.280]   that you wanted to add in this area or not
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.360]   on the withdrawing of the funds and the asset allocation?
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.200]   - No, I think you covered it pretty well.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.080]   - Okay.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.960]   So we're gonna get to another one.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.160]   The third one here is the social security decision
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.540]   and some considerations about that.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.500]   And that's a common one.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.340]   We run different,
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.360]   we will run different scenarios for our clients
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:26.560]   on when they may think they will take out
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.060]   the social security or begin to receive social security.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.500]   And for a lot of people, the default is,
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.840]   "Oh, well, I'll just take it later
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.800]   because I'll get more money when I take it later."
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.320]   So that's a natural way of thinking for many folks.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.080]   Here's what I've learned over the years
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.600]   since I've worked with my clients about the socials,
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   about the decision on when to take social security.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.280]   Now I've run a lot of scenarios on these,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.840]   just a lot of them.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.840]   And in many cases, gosh, the dollar differences
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.600]   by the time you're 90 or 92
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.160]   in when you take social security,
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.920]   it's really a rounding error.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.080]   I mean, now it's $80,000, $100,000.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.520]   Now that was a big number when you were 25 and 30,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.680]   but in a plan where the assets get to be $4 million,
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.900]   $5 million, that literally is a rounding error in the plan.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.000]   So many times there can be very little difference
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.240]   in the actual amount of money that you have
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.480]   based upon when you take social security.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.040]   But here's what comes into play on social security.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.360]   As you're getting closer to social security,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.040]   we tell a lot of our clients,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.920]   they're 55, 58, 62, they wanna know,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.360]   well, when's the best time to take social security?
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.200]   And I'll tell them, look,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.920]   that's gonna be more of a game time decision.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.700]   As you get closer, that will come into play.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.000]   I think someone's got a question.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.760]   We actually don't have any slides.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.320]   So there aren't any slides here.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.160]   So you will kind of figure out your social,
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.520]   when you wanna take social security, kind of how it goes.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.000]   If you have a change in your health,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.720]   that may motivate your interest
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   in taking social security early.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.200]   Clearly happens to people
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   where they may become more skeptical about their longevity.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.160]   And so they're gonna take social security earlier.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   If your assets are not performing well,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   when you're 64, 65, 66, you may say to yourself,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.880]   look, I just wanna get this guaranteed paycheck coming in.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.560]   Let's just start getting social security now.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.040]   Another factor which I think may impact people more
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.800]   in years ahead will be if we develop more cynicism
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.740]   about social security and how much it's gonna pay,
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.640]   I think that may motivate people
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.920]   to begin to take social security earlier as well.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.120]   Look, let's just lock it in.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.480]   I don't know if they're gonna start cutting this thing
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.900]   in the future.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.080]   But the biggest single factor in my experience
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.000]   in when people take social security
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.240]   or the reason to take it instead of deferring it to 70
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.120]   is 'cause they want the money.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.240]   It's really that simple.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.220]   The benefit of taking social security later
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.160]   means that you're going to have more money
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.600]   when you're 84, 85, 87.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.540]   The problem is when you're 87,
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.240]   you're gonna wanna be 65 again.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.960]   And so that is a realization that a lot of people have
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.640]   where they kind of look past the numbers
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.480]   with social security.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.040]   And they'll say, look, there are things we wanna do now.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.360]   We wanna spend, we're healthy now.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.880]   We're gonna travel and spend time with our family,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.800]   spend money on our family.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.240]   And social security is a way for them
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.300]   to simply have more money now.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.680]   And by the way, I have done plans with people,
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.060]   kind of the early retiree, the 57, 58 year old,
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.000]   where depending upon their spending level
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.920]   and the amount of social security they're going to get,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.720]   if they take it early, and when I mean early,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.200]   I mean 62 or 63,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.740]   that actually improves their assets over the long run
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.000]   because it allows them to avoid dipping into assets
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.880]   from 62 to 67.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.280]   That doesn't happen that much,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.840]   but we've had enough scenarios
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.740]   where I can say that it is a legitimate outcome.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.040]   Jason, did you have anything you wanted to add on social?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.360]   'Cause Jason gets involved in these as well
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.340]   with our clients.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.880]   - Yeah, I'm on the side of the fence
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.320]   that although it is a rounding error, I agree with Mark.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.460]   Social security right now
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.160]   is the only inflation adjusted annuity we can buy.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.000]   And we buy that by waiting.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.040]   And it goes back though to personal choice,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.900]   because look, how many of us have a two and a half
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.880]   or three or three and a half percent mortgage?
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.260]   Does it make sense to pay it off early?
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.440]   Well, that's personal preference.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.800]   Some people want to pay it off early,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.840]   pay off the mortgage early,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.280]   even though they could afford to write the check.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.360]   Other people don't want to pay it off early
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.560]   because it's such a great rate,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.200]   they think they can do better in the market
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.560]   even though they have assets to do that.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.660]   So it's personal choice.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.120]   With social security, some people want to take it.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.040]   That's great.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.920]   It's really not gonna affect people
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.960]   on the high end of the spectrum that have a lot of assets.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   Now, it will mess up
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.720]   when we're trying to do growth conversions
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.040]   because you're bringing in more income.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.320]   You're in that really goofy social security tax bubble
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.200]   where even though, yes, you're in the 12% tax rate,
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.480]   based on how things go,
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.640]   you may be paying 18 to 20 to 40%
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.400]   for every additional dollar of social security
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.600]   based on the way that the bubble works.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.860]   For people that are clearly past that,
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.640]   again, it's personal choice.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   I believe in delaying it longer rather than sooner,
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.040]   especially if one of the spouses is younger
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.480]   and if that younger spouse is a female,
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.920]   you typically want to delay
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.160]   in order to get the survivor to have
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.120]   as much as a benefit as they can get.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   I do have a couple of slides
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.800]   that I'm gonna pop up real quick.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.440]   They're not designed to convince or confuse you.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.600]   They're just a couple of slides
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.320]   I wanna show up to show graphically.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.920]   The first slide, I have to give credit to where it came from.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.760]   I went to a CPE class put on by the AICPA
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.360]   and Ted Sperensky, well-known in this area.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.000]   He's a great presenter.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.360]   He did a whole two-hour production
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.500]   and I just grabbed a couple of slides.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.160]   The first slide I wanna show that he put up
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   is this is the same age for a couple, the same benefit,
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.200]   and the different bars are the colors
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.480]   starting at age 62, early, full retirement,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.600]   and then delaying to 70.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.760]   Also, both dying, which probably won't happen together
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   at 75, 85, and 95.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.960]   The color coded is down here at the bottom where the dark,
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.560]   we start at 62, 66, 70.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360]   If you know when you're both going to die, it's easy.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.080]   We know that, but because we don't know
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.960]   when we're going to die,
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.200]   that's why this question is a big deal.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.120]   When should I start taking it?
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.000]   The main thing that I've learned
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.400]   is take it when you want to.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.920]   If you don't need to take it,
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.160]   then you can think about if you want to delay or not.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.080]   If you're gonna die early,
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.440]   yeah, take it as soon as you can.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.280]   If you're gonna live to about your life expectancy,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.100]   you know, it doesn't matter if you get a full retirement age
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.320]   or you delay because it's close.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.800]   It's when you live longer, obviously, that you'll get more,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.840]   but you may have to spend down other assets.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.840]   Again, this is inflation adjusted.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.080]   That's a huge benefit.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.760]   One more slide I want to show.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.500]   This is the bigger deal.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.360]   If one of the couple is a low or no wage earner
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.080]   married to somebody with a full retirement benefit
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   of $2,000 and the lower no wage earner is actually older.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.080]   In this case, you know, no matter when you die,
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.880]   you probably want to take it as soon as you can.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.280]   And that's just pure math.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.180]   We went through, like I said, a large presentation on this,
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.920]   but I thought these will graphically show.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   Sometimes there's not a lot of difference when you wait.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   And other times there is a lot of difference when you wait.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.720]   - Right.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.000]   - Anyway. - Thanks, Mason.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.960]   So I'm going to go on to the next topic here.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.680]   Now, this one is fun for me.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.120]   And it has to do with this decision
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.360]   about when you're going to retire.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.480]   And this involves being honest with yourself
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   and having some introspection
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   and kind of evaluating your aspiration.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.280]   And it's the decision
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.960]   about actually leaving your profession.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.560]   And I've run into this one a lot.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.760]   And so I've had to ask some of my clients
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.960]   and I'll acknowledge with them.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.280]   This is for those out there that have not retired yet.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.360]   Do you really have the courage to quit your job?
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.580]   Because once you leave,
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.040]   for the most part, you're not coming back.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:12.960]   And then you got to figure out
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.120]   what you're going to do with your time.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.160]   And man, that can really impact you personally,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.360]   can impact your relationships with those close to you.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   So it takes a lot of courage for people to retire.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.800]   I did this podcast because I kept on getting this complaint,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.080]   or I wouldn't even say complaint, a comment from my client.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.120]   They used to say this to me
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.080]   and I had to do a whole podcast on this.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.240]   Oh, well, I can't retire because of healthcare costs.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.400]   So they've got three and a half, $4 million.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.600]   They're going to spend about 80, 90,000 a year.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.480]   They got social security, got a pension,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.080]   but they're going to keep working
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.160]   just 'cause now they actually have to pay for healthcare.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.240]   And I would say to them,
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.280]   I don't really think that's why you're not retiring.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.880]   I think you're rationalizing why you can't stop working.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.400]   And they kind of agree with that.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.640]   And so many of the folks that I work with,
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.280]   and maybe some of you out there,
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   it kind of, it's a tough call to leave work forever.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.480]   And so we can run the numbers for folks
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.800]   and they're going to look pretty great
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.200]   for many people that we do these plans.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Some folks, they're going to be more challenged,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.920]   but man, that transition involves
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.160]   a lot of courage for many folks.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   And as a kind of an addendum to that,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.520]   or an additional consideration,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.680]   for many people that we work with,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.960]   many people here, many people you know,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.680]   they are successful planners, successful savers.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.640]   They've arrived at a good place.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.560]   And so they're ready to transition
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.440]   or they are transitioning to retirement,
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.880]   but man, they have difficulty spending money.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   They can't do it and it's really a shame.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.120]   I had a meeting with a guy last week
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.840]   and this is what he said.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.640]   And we were talking about his investment allocation.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.520]   I didn't use the word greedy to him,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.840]   but actually that was kind of going through my head.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.480]   And what we were talking about
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.560]   was his investment allocation.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   And kind of a default comment I have to my clients
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   is that if were it me, and it will be me at some point,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.280]   'cause I will retire eventually,
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.120]   were it me, I would opt for more stability
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.200]   and give up growth.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.880]   So that would be kind of how I would want
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.400]   to transition on into retirement.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.720]   So I would have a more conservative portfolio.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.040]   And in this guy's particular case,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.160]   he was comfortable being about 85% stocks.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.560]   And his comment was, well, if the markets don't cooperate,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.400]   which for many people is like the biggest thing
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.520]   that they think about is how's my portfolio gonna do?
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.600]   Can I live off my money if the markets go down?
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.360]   And his comment was, if the markets don't cooperate,
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.720]   then I'll just reduce my discretionary spending
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.800]   for a few years.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.600]   And I said, really?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.680]   So between the ages of 62 and 65,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.800]   you're not gonna like do much, really?
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.360]   You got one life.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.720]   And so that just means you're gonna have more money
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.240]   when you're 85 or 90.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.480]   But man, you weren't able to do things
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   when you were in your 60s,
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.680]   which is really when you wanted to do things.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   And so that was a part of my point was that
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.320]   if you've been thinking about your future for so long
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.920]   and planning for retirement,
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.000]   or maybe not even thinking about it,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.880]   but it was a methodical part of your process.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.040]   And now you're there.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.320]   And if you are successful, gosh,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.800]   I wouldn't be hesitant about spending your money.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.040]   It's okay to blow through some of your money as a retiree.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.360]   So, and that is a difficult mindset
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.040]   for some people to get into.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.960]   But man, it's just gonna be a shame
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.280]   if you've done the right things,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.720]   but can't pull the trigger on,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.200]   and I'm not talking about spending $250,000 a year,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.360]   getting a nicer, taking a longer vacation,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.600]   spending more money on your family,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.760]   whatever's important to you.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.640]   So I wanted to talk about that
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.960]   as you begin to think about this transition from retirement,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.520]   or if you're already there
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.360]   and are thinking about how to spend your money.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.800]   Now, this is kind of related to this one,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.120]   but this one has been something
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.240]   that has always been a part of my conversations
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.960]   with the people that we work with.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:15.320]   And it's about how you should think of your expenses
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.440]   when you think about your aging years.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.800]   Now, the way that I view retirement is that
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.080]   for most people, depending upon when they retire,
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.560]   they're going to have a period of time,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.520]   whether it's five years, 10, 15, 20 years,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.920]   where they're gonna spend more money.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.560]   But there's also going to be at some point or another,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.640]   a drop-off in their spending, their consumption.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.520]   And in some cases, it will go down dramatically.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.040]   So when you think of the future,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.920]   I would not be intimidated
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.480]   by the idea of spending down some of your assets.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.120]   I think it's perfectly fine to do that.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.000]   But I would think of your expense spending pattern
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.640]   as kind of a trajectory where it steadily goes up
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.960]   and then it drops down.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.120]   In some cases, it drops down dramatic.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.600]   And I share with my clients,
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.160]   my father, he's a great example of this.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.120]   My dad's 89, he'll be 90 this summer.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.800]   He still lives in his house by himself.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   And his health is generally pretty good,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.060]   as good as it can be for somebody his age.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.080]   But what is he gonna do?
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.680]   He can't spend money.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.240]   He goes to the diner and he watches the ball game.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.640]   That's kind of what dad does.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.600]   He cuts the grass and he socializes with neighbors.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.000]   He lives in Washington State.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.680]   His biggest expenses is his property taxes
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.520]   and his insurance.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.080]   But he spends about $28,000, $29,000 a year.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.120]   Now, when mom was alive four years ago,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.360]   they had cut down spending even before she passed.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.920]   They were spending about $35,000, $36,000 a year.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.720]   And in their heyday, as it were,
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.320]   they were spending about $65,000 to $70,000 a year.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.560]   So even with inflation,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.400]   which is the next point I wanna get into,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.200]   their consumption had gone down.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.360]   So I don't think it does you any good
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.840]   when you're planning for your future to simply say,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.760]   oh, well, we're spending $95,000 this year.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.080]   So when we're 88, we'll be spending $165,000.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   Like that's just not the way people behave.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.280]   It's not how their lives unfold.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.600]   So that's an important consideration
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   when you think about your expenses over time.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.540]   In a moment, we're gonna talk about long-term care,
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.040]   insurance, and how to think about long-term care as well.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.000]   But that's an important consideration
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.560]   in how we do plans with our clients.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.560]   In fact, we have a category we call initial retirement.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.160]   And we suggested our clients use it.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.260]   It's for a period of time, 10, 15 years,
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.960]   where you just have a larger number.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.320]   And even for travel,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.600]   we usually only do the travel budget
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.000]   for maybe 10, 15, 20 years as a part of their plan.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.140]   Which leads me to the second point about inflation.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.860]   And I've done some rants about inflation on my podcast,
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.700]   and I've really ran into clients about that.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.020]   But when we do our projections for our clients,
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.420]   and we have these different graded expenses,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.340]   I like to use 1.2% as an inflationary factor.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:11.580]   I know that there are many models
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.740]   that talk about the importance of inflation
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.800]   and the real rate of return on your investments
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.240]   and the nominal rate of return.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.360]   But gosh, I'd be very careful
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.280]   about using significant inflation numbers
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.880]   when you think about your plan
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.400]   and trying to figure out if you have enough money to retire.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.080]   Because if you run a plan with, let's just say,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.960]   a base return of inflation of even 2% or 3%,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.060]   and you add that into the year expenses,
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.200]   and then you start to make decisions
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.320]   about when you can retire and when you can't retire,
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.260]   you're gonna be looking at some massive expenses
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.800]   when you're 85.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.160]   So I would recommend using
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.540]   a much more modest inflation number
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.360]   in your planning purposes.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.840]   And that actually kind of fits in
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.600]   with that prior comment I was making
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.700]   about where we even have recommended our clients
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.540]   that they have different expense categories over time.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.900]   But I don't fear inflation at all.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.940]   I mean, I certainly would fear inflation
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.960]   if we start getting rampant inflation in our economy,
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.800]   but just in day-to-day consumption expenses,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:23.060]   inflation for retirees, that's not a concern that I have.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.820]   Which leads on to the next point,
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:32.860]   which is long-term care insurance or long-term care costs
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.760]   and how you might wanna consider that.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.420]   And Jason will talk about this as well.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.060]   Do you need long-term care insurance?
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.300]   I actually am a proponent
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.420]   of people getting long-term care insurance
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.400]   if they are in the right situation,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.160]   meaning that if their assets are enough
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.100]   where I think that they're in jeopardy.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.500]   If your assets are pretty low,
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.980]   maybe less than 300, 400,000,
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.700]   I'm not sure long-term care insurance makes sense
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.760]   just because you don't have enough to insure.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.920]   Maybe you can just spend down your money
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.380]   and then at that point you just qualify
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.560]   for medical assistance.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.460]   On the other hand, if you have assets
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.300]   which are greater than some level,
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.620]   some certain level, 2 million maybe,
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.340]   whatever it happens to be,
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.800]   at that point, if your numbers project really well,
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.940]   I think you can definitely self-insure.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:35.760]   Also, for many, their home is a pretty big asset.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.400]   Their home may be valued at $700,000, $800,000, $900,000,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.920]   and that's nice to have in your back pocket
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.000]   if you end up needing,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.040]   or the last surviving spouse ends up needing care,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.700]   they can sell that property
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.000]   and take a lot of those proceeds
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.960]   that will help pay for their care.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.240]   With regards to long-term care insurance
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.940]   or long-term care in general,
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.500]   I don't know if you've ever been
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.260]   to one of these long-term care seminars,
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.960]   but we certainly used to have these trainings
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.940]   when I worked in a conventional distribution system,
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.940]   but the statistic is two out of every three Americans
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.500]   at some point in their life need long-term care.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.180]   And my mom needed long-term care.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:20.180]   She was in a transition care facility for about 60 days,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.900]   went back home, went back into another one again
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.980]   for a couple of weeks,
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.940]   and then she went to a group home and passed away there.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.420]   And so the long-term care sales industry
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.860]   will use that as a ploy, I guess,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.740]   to get people interested in long-term care insurance.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:38.660]   I've seen a couple of other studies, two others though,
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.180]   that talked about your real risk
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.180]   has an American over the age of 65
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.020]   of having an extended long-term care event,
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.340]   which is when it's really gonna get costly.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.180]   And that's less than the area of 10,
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.560]   that's less than about 10% of people
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.400]   that are going to have
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.340]   a significant costly long-term care event.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.620]   If you're going to, now,
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.540]   but I would definitely encourage people
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.580]   if they are interested to shop for long-term care.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.140]   In my experience, kind of the sweet spot to look at it
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.340]   is your early to mid to latter 50s.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.100]   Of course, if you talk with a long-term salesperson,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.300]   it's like, whenever you talk with them,
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.100]   that's the right, if you're 10,
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.500]   that's the right time to take out a long-term care policy.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.020]   And some concerns,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.620]   and they do certainly raise an important point
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.260]   in that if you get diagnosed with a condition,
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.060]   and think, oh, maybe I should go get a long-term care policy,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.600]   then you're gonna damage your ability to receive a policy
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.220]   once you get diagnosed with some sort of condition,
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.220]   which would possibly indicate
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.420]   a higher likelihood of needing long-term care.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.540]   So yeah, so that's a bona fide factor in the consideration.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.420]   But I think early to mid 50s,
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.200]   latter 50s is a good time to shop
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.220]   for long-term care insurance.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:59.420]   Why would you get long-term care insurance
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.840]   even if you have significant wealth?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.940]   There are people that do that,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.540]   and they do it, in my experience, for two reasons.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.820]   One is they're simply sensitive to long-term care insurance.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.020]   Maybe they dealt with it with their parents,
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.340]   a family member, they're very aware of the cost of it,
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   and they simply wanna take that off the table.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.320]   And for some, it kind of frees them up.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.540]   They feel like they can spend more money,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.200]   'cause they got rid of that one big giant potential thing
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.580]   that could happen to them,
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   even though it's not really gonna devastate their estate.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:32.700]   The other reason that people that have wealth
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.540]   will get long-term care insurance
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.140]   is just to preserve their estate.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.500]   They'll use it as an estate preservation tactic.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.100]   If you are going to get long-term care insurance
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.700]   and you're shopping for it, people say,
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.460]   "Well, I looked into it and it was pretty expensive."
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.260]   Well, if you're gonna get a long-term care policy,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.820]   it's going to be expensive if it's gonna be a good policy,
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.600]   'cause long-term care is expensive.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.340]   So you can expect to pay, I don't know, four to six,
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.220]   maybe $8,000 a year.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.460]   You can also get these upfront pay policies
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.940]   where you pay a lot upfront,
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.700]   get all the premiums out of the way.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.700]   But like other insurances that we buy,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.660]   when you buy long-term care insurance,
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.560]   you can do a fair amount of cost sharing
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.960]   with the insurance company.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.660]   They have things called an elimination period,
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.460]   which is the period of time before the care policy kicks in,
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.740]   90 days, 180 days, maybe 365 days.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.260]   They have a daily benefit,
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.780]   and that's the amount of pay or the amount of cost
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.480]   that the policy will pay on a daily basis.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.840]   So you could look at a policy where you might say,
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:38.340]   "Look, we can afford to pay for 30% each day.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.960]   We just want somebody to help with the majority of the cost."
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.340]   So you'd be willing to pay on some of the daily benefit.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.060]   Another big variable in a long-term care policy
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.660]   would be the inflation rider.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.520]   These things come with an inflation rider.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.560]   It's either simple or compound.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.740]   Compound interest means that the money,
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.780]   the benefit that you're gonna get
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.620]   is gonna grow at a faster rate than a simple inflation rider,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.980]   but it costs a lot more.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.860]   That's a much more expensive policy.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.520]   So you can massage the premiums
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.500]   or the cost of these policies
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.480]   by doing some cost sharing with the insurance companies.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.460]   So those are some thoughts on long-term care.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.820]   Jason, did you have anything you wanted to add
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.700]   on long-term care and your thoughts on that?
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.900]   Maybe the insurance carriers?
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.280]   - Yeah, just a couple of brief comments.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.140]   So long-term care, when it came out,
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:32.380]   I don't know, 20 years ago, I mean, two years ago,
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.100]   it was a novel concept and it was affordable.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.820]   I mean, people were talking about in their forties,
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.180]   "Go ahead and lock in a plan now."
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.420]   But what happened is the actuaries
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.580]   were not able to model the cost.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.180]   And over a short period of time,
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.380]   many carriers got out of business
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.060]   and/or jacked up their rates to cover
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:58.180]   because the actuaries could not model these costs.
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.800]   It wasn't like the risk associated
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.300]   with early premature death or disability
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.940]   that they've had decades of research
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.640]   and decades of experience.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:15.780]   Modeling and doing the actuarial numbers ended up,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   they were wrong.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:19.300]   So it has become very expensive.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.460]   And the danger is if you buy it
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.540]   for a number of years, decades,
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.820]   maybe you can't afford it
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.380]   right before you actually need it.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.340]   So you have to be cautious and really think about
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.980]   how much you're going to rely on it.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.300]   We definitely wanna buy it and we don't wanna use it
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.920]   because it's like buying a house insurance.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.140]   If your home burns down, you're glad you have it,
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.580]   but you hope your house never burned down.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.200]   Well, what if your house insurance just got higher
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.360]   and higher and higher and higher
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.180]   to where you had a debate,
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.460]   "Should I continue to buy house insurance?"
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.100]   Well, house insurance does not go up.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.660]   And the reason being is
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.740]   because the actuaries have it nailed down pretty well.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.940]   Long-term care insurance, I agree with Mark.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.140]   If you don't have a lot of assets, you don't need it.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.820]   If you have a lot of assets, you can self-insure.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.060]   And the odds of running through your money
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.220]   are much lower than the industry would lead you to believe.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.500]   It is there though, no doubt about that.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.980]   Thanks.
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:15.820]   - Yeah.
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:20.340]   Also, I've talked with a few clients
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.220]   and shared this experience.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.300]   It's interesting how people feel
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.980]   about their long-term care policies.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.620]   Like when they buy it when they're 55, it's,
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.140]   "All right, I got approved.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.700]   All right, we'll write the check for this thing."
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.320]   They buy it with reluctance.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.020]   They're 65, it's more regular part of their budget.
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.900]   Now when they're 75, they're glad to have it.
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.260]   Then when they're 85,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.280]   man, that's the one thing they don't wanna miss the payment on.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.620]   They paid in this thing all these years,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.540]   so they wanna make sure they get their money out of it.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.460]   So a couple of other concepts I wanna go into,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.060]   which are more general concepts.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.940]   One is the idea of how to handle your investments in general
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.120]   as you get closer to, and I mentioned this earlier.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.460]   For those that have been, and of course, Bill Bernstein
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:02.700]   has the famous comment about,
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.860]   "If you've won the game, why keep playing?"
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.220]   I'm not sure if he literally means
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.160]   take everything and just put it in cash.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.740]   But I think what he's implying here is
[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:14.140]   why expose yourself to unnecessary risk
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.460]   if you've already been a successful saver
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.020]   and your retirement's set up.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.140]   And that is a comment I would share with my clients as well,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.060]   is if you're already there, you've won,
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.820]   you have a successful plan,
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   you've gotta figure out
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.800]   where you're gonna go with this thing.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.380]   And if it were at me, and again,
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.180]   it will be me at some point, I hope to retire.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.220]   I'm gonna take, I'm gonna be a much more conservative,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.740]   much more cautious investor,
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.180]   even without regard to the interest rates at the time.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.460]   So I would move my portfolio
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.180]   into more of a stable portfolio,
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:50.220]   whatever that means, 40, 60, 50, 50, 55, 45,
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.300]   or some sort of asset allocation like that.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.780]   And I would encourage people to try,
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.380]   to the extent that you can really do this,
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.340]   and I know this is hard,
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:03.020]   but go through a bonafide thought exercise
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.180]   where you've retired,
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:09.340]   and we go through a really horrible financial apocalypse,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.340]   not something that lasts for six months,
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.240]   and then the market goes back up again,
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.820]   or nine months, or a year and a half,
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.300]   but something that scares everyone to death.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.980]   Markets go down by 50, 55%.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.420]   Whatever the intervention is,
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.080]   that whatever, that whomever's doing is not working.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.420]   'Cause you can't get away from that when it happens.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.740]   Whenever the markets go down,
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.740]   like the last bad one we had was March of last year,
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.700]   two worst weeks ever, here we go again,
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.260]   they shut down the markets three days.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.620]   I actually had an email exchange with some buddies of mine,
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.060]   where we were trying to pick the low of the Dow,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.700]   and we started to get really cynical.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.260]   I was like, you know, one, whatever, it's gonna go.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.060]   And of course, it settled down,
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.700]   but it went right back up again.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.780]   What if that doesn't happen for two, three, four years,
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.820]   and you're still 80, 20?
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.140]   Are you really gonna begin to stop doing things,
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:59.380]   enjoying your life when you only get one retirement?
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.520]   So it's a good thought exercise to really think,
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.020]   it was a good thought exercise.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.380]   What I don't like about it, it's just a thought exercise.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.880]   It's like, it's not really what's happening at the moment.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.580]   Now, the final thing I'll mention
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.780]   about planning for your retirement
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.860]   is when I have sessions with our clients,
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.220]   sometimes I feel like I'm pulling them out of this pit
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.460]   of weeds, where they're so bogged down
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.820]   in things that never matter,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.640]   that they've lost track of the big picture.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.860]   So don't lose perspective on what you've accomplished
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.460]   and where you're at, as you're thinking about your future.
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.780]   And what I mean by that is I would not grind
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.580]   over these numbers unless you kind of enjoy
[00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.260]   that kind of thing, and some people actually do.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.200]   Are you making changes in your portfolio
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.780]   or thinking about changes to just do it?
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:57.900]   It's probably spinning wheels more than anything else.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.820]   So I'd really try to take a few steps back
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.380]   and focus on the big picture.
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.880]   And where that really comes in handy
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.380]   is if you are hamstringing yourself
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.900]   from spending money on yourself or your family
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.140]   or things that are important to you,
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.120]   'cause you're concerned about your plan
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.340]   when you've lost the perspective
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.040]   of how good your plan actually is.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.860]   So that's kind of the topics that we wanted to cover.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.820]   I got distracted.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.320]   Those are the topics that we wanted to cover
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.620]   for some considerations in structuring your investments.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.240]   Now, Alan, did you want to have questions on this
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.620]   before we moved on to the technology?
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.940]   Our technology comments will actually be more brief.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.580]   So did you want to have a Q&A here if there were any?
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.380]   - Yeah, so why don't we take a little break
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.660]   and have some Q&A here,
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.540]   if you guys can submit questions by the chat.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.980]   If people are not on camera
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.940]   and don't mind having their name pop up,
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.960]   I'll keep recording this for the time being.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.520]   So please submit your questions.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.000]   Or if you want to ask a question in person,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.620]   raise your hand using the raised hand icon.
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:14.760]   - Do have Larry Alexander had his hand up.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.480]   I don't know if that was intentional.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:24.960]   - Lady Geek, you had a question?
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.920]   - Yeah, I just wanted to mention
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.560]   that during the choice of the medical insurance,
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.160]   what helped me greatly
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.800]   was to use a medical insurance broker.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.840]   And there happened to be one near me,
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.020]   he helped my parents out,
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.280]   especially when you have to mix it with Medicare.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.840]   That's not for me right now, but for my parents it was.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.120]   He went through every plan.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.760]   He came to the door and he,
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.140]   I know they take a commission, but it's no cost to you.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.800]   And they signed on the spot
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.180]   because he spent like half hour, 20 minutes,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.520]   you know, a long time with them and just said,
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.240]   what's your situation?
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.660]   Here's what you do.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.120]   This is the clear cut choice.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.900]   So I'm actually using one now.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.240]   I'm actually also on COBRA.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.520]   I retired last year and I found out that COBRA for me
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.580]   was cheaper than the marketplace because of my age.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.840]   Maybe you should mention that the premiums
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.320]   go with your medical,
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.560]   the premiums of your employer
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.560]   go by the average age of the workforce.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.480]   Since I'm an older person,
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.280]   it's actually more expensive if I go to the private market.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.640]   So by going on COBRA, which actually is paying 102%,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.480]   I still save nearly half
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.320]   of what it will cost me out on the marketplace.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.920]   So when my insurance expires in October,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.520]   I'll call my broker and say, just set me up.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.760]   So I think that just saves a lot of work
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.840]   and I'll do my own research,
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.800]   but I just want to mention that,
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   use a broker to help you.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.240]   They do this stuff every day.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.080]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.720]   I want to follow in on what Lady Geek said is that
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.360]   there are some really good people out there that are,
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.200]   and she's right.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.920]   They work in this day in and day out.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.120]   They know which plans and yeah,
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   they're going to make a commission,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.800]   but it's not untoward anybody.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.120]   They're actually doing a good thing out there.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.400]   So yeah, good point.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.220]   - Yeah, and make sure that's not the same
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.520]   as a life insurance agent.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.640]   It's a separate agency that does medical.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.680]   Don't go to the provincial or med life
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.840]   or any of those normal websites you see on TV.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.120]   It's a medical insurance broker and that's all they do.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.680]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.720]   - Yeah, it's a bit of a, you know, it's a specialization.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.560]   Here in Minnesota,
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.920]   we have brokers from UCARE and Medicare or Medica
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.040]   and Group Health that can provide
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.160]   quality guidance to consumers.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   In fact, we did an hour long interview with,
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.480]   I can't remember her name,
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.800]   but she works for a national Medicare broker
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.040]   from out of Dallas.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.480]   So, you know, we put that on our podcast.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.220]   - All right, Martha, you had a question?
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.880]   Perhaps.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.760]   - I think I may have seen some questions in the chat.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.000]   Is that where they're going?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.600]   - Martha, I think you're on, there you go.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.440]   - Thank you.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.840]   Sorry.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.680]   Jason, I missed why there was such a difference
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.560]   with the zip,
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.640]   people living in different zip codes on the subsidies.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   Is it because of the way the states went into Obamacare?
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.040]   - Yeah, that's a big part of it.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.580]   So, it has to do with the average,
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.160]   what the rates are in that particular county,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.860]   because if you are shopping for health exchange,
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.520]   marketplace healthcare,
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.200]   it's based on the county and the zip code that you live in
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.760]   on how the plans are priced.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.520]   So, that's exactly it.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.240]   That's why I picked those zip codes.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.520]   I mean, I picked mine
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.080]   and it happens to be a very low number.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   But West Virginia is notorious for having high plans.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.560]   In particular, Charleston, West Virginia
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.800]   is one of the highest,
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.060]   way higher than Hawaii and Oceanside, California.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.620]   So, it just depends on where you live,
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.000]   if it makes sense to use,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.160]   especially with the removal of the cliff.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.600]   - All right.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.320]   There are a couple of chat questions here from Robert.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:18.680]   I guess maybe this is just for the participants.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   How many clients,
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:23.160]   I guess participants limit their adjusted gross income
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.660]   by IRMA thresholds?
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.920]   - I didn't hear that.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.340]   Jason would know more about that one.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.040]   Did you hear that question, Jason?
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.880]   - Was it a poll question or a content question?
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.680]   - No, I think it was just asking,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.720]   one of our participants is asking other participants
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.880]   about how many of them limit their adjusted gross income,
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.080]   or I should say, manage it based upon IRMA thresholds.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:50.960]   I know for one,
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.120]   I tend to do that to some extent with Roth conversions,
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.800]   at least to factor that in.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.080]   It's probably an individualized decision
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.120]   weighing the pros and the cons.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.360]   - Yeah, I can jump in with a quick comment on that.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.600]   I've had a couple of discussions with Mark
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.640]   and I'm going to share a slide here for everybody
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.620]   itching to look at another slide.
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.780]   Okay, so this comes right off the source
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:18.080]   as the Medicare website.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.240]   And what this is, is for 2021.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.660]   Generally, we know that the Part B is 148.50 per month.
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.400]   So for a couple that each have Medicare,
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:38.620]   they're going to be paying about 300 bucks a month,
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.300]   3,600 a year for Part B coverage.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.300]   Great.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.980]   Well, what if they hit IRMA?
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.760]   Which IRMA ends up being additional premiums.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.540]   It's called the income-related monthly adjustment amount.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.640]   And if you are married filing joint,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.620]   if you're over 176,000 up to 222,
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.620]   look, you're paying about, what, another 60 bucks
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.220]   each per month, per year.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.100]   So it's not life-changing.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.140]   It does start to add up.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:17.140]   You know, when you get up to more than 222,000 up to 276,
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:22.520]   and here we're talking about getting pretty thick
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.520]   into the 24% tax bracket, you're doubling Part B.
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.660]   Again, not the end of the world.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.060]   The numbers do start to add up after a while.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.020]   Don't forget too, that's Part B.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.020]   Part D, if you have a Part D plan, drug prescription plan,
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.000]   there's also an IRMA effect.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.260]   If you're over 176,000, it ends up being 1,230 per month
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.380]   on top of whatever you're paying for your drug plan,
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.460]   25 bucks a month more for a couple on Medicare.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.260]   So again, not plan busting,
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.660]   but the numbers add up after a while
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.200]   in the 24% tax bracket.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.780]   You know, when you get up over 222,
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.780]   you're looking at $63 plus the amount of your drug plan.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:19.300]   So you have to be aware of it.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.420]   And definitely, if you're close to it
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.780]   and can keep under the next threshold, sure, do that.
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.780]   But, you know, don't go without income.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:35.060]   Spend your money, as Mark was saying earlier,
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:39.260]   because as I like to say, you know, go first class
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.480]   because your heirs definitely will.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.420]   - True.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.060]   Dan had a question.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:49.380]   Why not keep taxable account in equities
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.780]   and replace them with equities in your IRA or 401k
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.540]   the same day?
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.580]   That way you were actually selling bonds
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.480]   and not taking the ordinary income taxes
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.780]   in your brokerage account.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:03.840]   - Yeah, well, yeah, a lot of strategies.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:08.020]   You have to be careful though, you could have watch sales.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.580]   But no, I mean, it's a strategy for sure
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.360]   because you're maintaining your asset allocation.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.860]   You're trying to sell strategically, tactically.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.120]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:27.420]   - There was another one that just popped up there, Alan.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.400]   - Okay, if you can read that.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.020]   - Well, let me, I gotta figure out how to use this.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.260]   Well, okay, why not?
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.400]   Okay.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.020]   Okay.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.780]   If you don't think you'll spend, okay.
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:47.980]   - I see, if you don't think, go ahead.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.740]   - If you don't think you'll spend all you have accumulated,
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.860]   is there any problem?
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:56.220]   Okay, I'm laughing.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.380]   Is there any problem taking the mindset
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.460]   that hey, this is your grandkids money?
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.140]   You can do whatever you want with your money,
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.380]   whatever your mindset happens to be.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.380]   And so I think that's perfectly,
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.820]   because I think what you're talking about
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.940]   is either giving the money away while you're alive
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:12.380]   or just investing it in a way
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.060]   where it's really for your grandkids,
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.740]   which would typically mean you would invest it aggressively.
[00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.300]   There's nothing wrong at all with that.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:22.240]   As long as, if you make that decision when you're 80
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.940]   or 79 or whatever, if when you're 90,
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.140]   you don't sit around and think, oh my, what was I thinking?
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.640]   How did I possibly end up with 100% equities?
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.180]   So as long as you can maintain that perspective,
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.500]   then yeah, that's perfectly fine.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.380]   You know, we do plans with people
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.060]   that, and they're in this group, like people,
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.140]   not like, I mean, these are representative
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   of people in this group.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.880]   Maybe there are some people we've done this plans with.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.380]   Where they can't, they haven't come to grips
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.420]   with how much money they have.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:53.220]   Like they can't, they don't understand.
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.060]   The numbers are too big.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.460]   And so they don't, you know,
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.500]   they've lost perspective on that.
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:05.100]   - One thing, I'll throw out relating to long-term care,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.060]   a personal anecdote.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.100]   My 89-year-old mother and my father,
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.220]   who passed away about 28 years ago,
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.460]   sold insurance in the end,
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:15.940]   selling long-term care insurance.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.940]   I didn't know much about the details of that,
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.220]   but I think he was honest and tried to work
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.560]   in his client's best interest.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.540]   But he, before he passed, made sure my mother
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:26.780]   had an excellent long-term care insurance policy.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.980]   And she's paid the premiums every year
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.420]   for 25 plus or 28 years.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.260]   And now her insurance company is Insolvent.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.960]   It's based in Pennsylvania.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.420]   It's in rehabilitation.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.660]   I've read through the current legal filings
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.180]   and they basically are millions of dollars in the red.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.700]   And now we don't know what percentage
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.060]   of the benefits she'll get.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.180]   She'll get something because the Guarantee Association
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.500]   for each state then steps in,
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.640]   but it's really up to the state to decide how they fund that.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:57.920]   And that's another consideration.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.860]   Even though she started off
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.040]   with an extremely highly rated insurance company,
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.980]   it got sold and then resold and purchased
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.860]   and acquired by somebody else until they went insolvent.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.020]   Probably some legal shenanigans that went on there,
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:12.500]   I suspect, but that's another consideration
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.060]   is the strength of the insurance company.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.660]   And even if they are strong on paper currently,
[00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.620]   what will it be in 20, 30 years down the line?
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:22.820]   - That's a good point.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.500]   If I could expand on that here a little bit,
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.620]   'cause I hate the word guaranteed.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.660]   You know who I worked for in 2008?
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:33.540]   I worked for Valek that was owned by AIG.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.800]   We had people, it's happened twice.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.840]   We had a little tiny office in Edina, Minnesota,
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.160]   corner office.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.440]   Two people came into our office threatening our staff.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.840]   You may not remember what was going on at that time,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.440]   but AIG was vilified in this country.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.480]   And before that though, AIG, I think,
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.000]   was one of the seven or eight companies.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.020]   And I don't really remember this stuff,
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.780]   but had the most sterling ratings
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.740]   from the rating agencies here in America, from all of them.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.300]   And we would promote that when we would go give
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.460]   presentations to one of the seven companies
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.100]   that have had a great rating for 80 years.
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.060]   And if you were to go read the Morningstar report
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.100]   and the ratings reports about AIG,
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.580]   they talk about the wide moat and all the businesses
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.900]   and how this is the most financially stable company
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.260]   in a matter of a weekend, right?
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.320]   I mean, that's not how long it took to happen,
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.020]   but basically AIG collapsed over one weekend.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:34.820]   So, and so I don't know how to do that analysis, Alan,
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.540]   where you would come up with an answer
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.380]   about the financial wherewithal
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.660]   of these companies in the future.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.860]   But it's a legitimate point.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.340]   If you're gonna buy long-term care insurance,
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:47.880]   you know, that risk is out there, so.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.460]   I think there's a quite,
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.880]   can we give an example of what you mean by big
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.640]   or what is considered average?
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:04.740]   That may be in the context of large assets.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.820]   I think that I would relate the size of the asset
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.080]   to the amount of spending people have.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.580]   So if you are people that,
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:15.440]   or if you're a person or a couple
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   where you kind of like to go to Greece for three months
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:24.020]   and you're gonna have a really nice place there,
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.660]   and then you're gonna go to Hawaii
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.660]   or wherever you're gonna go,
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.980]   and you're gonna spend $350,000 a year
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.580]   for the first seven years of your retirement,
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.420]   we don't have many clients like that.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:39.200]   But if you're gonna spend that kind of money,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:42.720]   then your portfolio, if it's $3 million,
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.060]   is in jeopardy unless you're getting
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.360]   like a really big pension.
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.740]   You're gonna have to have bigger assets.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.180]   Most of our clients are like that.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.480]   So if the question is, what does the term big mean?
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.460]   Gosh, many people can get by on social security
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.380]   and they, $1 million, 1.2, they're fine.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.220]   You just don't do that much.
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.460]   So I guess I would compare the size of the asset
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:03.980]   to the amount that they're gonna spend
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.180]   to determine if it's big.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.980]   'Cause yeah, that can be a very mis,
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:11.500]   that can mean, that's a term that can mean something
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.900]   to one person entirely different
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.400]   to something to somebody else.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.740]   - Actually, I have something
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.260]   about a long-term care insurance.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.060]   If I look at our family,
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:27.260]   most of the family members would not have benefited
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:29.900]   from long-term care insurance
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.900]   because it would not have kicked in before they passed away.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:41.340]   Or they simply did not need to be in a home, let's say,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:49.460]   care in their own home and the policy didn't cover that.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.380]   Or maybe had dementia and the policy, the old policy,
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.080]   some of them didn't cover that.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.300]   We had one family member who did have Parkinson's
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.700]   for many, many, many years
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.860]   and actually ran out the long-term care insurance.
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.620]   For him, it worked, it was critical.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.140]   It was very, very important.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.380]   But for most of our family members,
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.180]   they could have afforded the,
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.340]   without the, they could have made it
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.580]   without the long-term care insurance.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.420]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.060]   I think that's the reality for most.
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.940]   And by the way, a comment I would make
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.940]   when we're talking about thinking about paying
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.280]   for long-term care,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.900]   I'm uncomfortable with the strategy of giving away assets
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.420]   and going on medical assistance.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   And that's getting harder to do, I know, in various states
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.700]   'cause they have look-back periods.
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.100]   But I think an important consideration on that too
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.140]   is simply the idea that you don't have any more money
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.780]   and just giving it all away.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.580]   And you're losing some of your dignity when you do that.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.100]   And frankly, you're losing control
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.240]   over what your options may be in the future.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.180]   So for those that have wealth, they can consider doing it,
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:08.500]   but I consider that to be a fairly risky strategy
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.100]   and something I would have a hard time advocating.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.140]   - Could you expand on that for people with wealth?
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.900]   We're talking about, shall we say, your average bogel head.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.220]   (laughing)
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.540]   I mean- - Yeah, I know what you mean.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:23.380]   No offense.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:28.380]   - I mean, like, it's sufficiently, a nice retirement.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.380]   - Gosh, yeah.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.140]   - And what do you mean by spending down?
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.380]   How would we spend it down if we have social security,
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   if we have investments and I have a pension?
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.360]   How would I even spend it down?
[01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.300]   - Well, do you mean give it away?
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   Was that, I mean, for the long-term care?
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.900]   - No, you were talking about spending it down.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.220]   And are you referring to spending it down
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.940]   so that Medicaid comes into play?
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.020]   Is that- - Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.060]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.340]   Yeah, so let's just say that somebody...
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.180]   No, I was talking about giving it away.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.340]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.580]   And people will try to do that.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.300]   They'll give away their wealth to their family
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.420]   'cause they'll say things like,
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.220]   I don't want the nursing home to get my money.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.100]   So I'm going to give it away.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.860]   - And how do they, what do they do
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.760]   if they're not in a nursing home then?
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.900]   - Well, they're out of money at that point.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.700]   So, well, they may have enough to,
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.680]   they may have a pension or social security to pay the bills,
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.180]   but they're not spending that much money anymore.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.060]   - Okay.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.340]   - But yeah, I don't know if anybody's had any family members
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.180]   that could chime in.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.300]   I don't know anybody personally that's ever done that.
[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.180]   But I mean, that I know,
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.060]   I know clients that have done that over the years, so.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.260]   - Well, actually I am saving my money
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.940]   because we do not have long-term care insurance.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:56.820]   And that I worry about
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:00.740]   because I've seen with our family that when we get older,
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.740]   we do need assets to make our life more comfortable.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:12.460]   For example, hospital beds, we needed a hospital bed.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.340]   And the only type that Medicare would pay for
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.500]   was the crank type of hospital.
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.000]   They would not even pay for an electric hospital bed
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.420]   that would raise him up and raise him down
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:23.940]   at the push of a button.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.900]   And so I said, well, who's going to pull,
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.700]   who's going to crank it up?
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.300]   Well, he has to get out of bed to do it,
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.040]   or you have to have aides there to do it.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.580]   In other words, we have to think ahead and have,
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.160]   I always felt, and have enough money in the bank
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.160]   to pay to make our life easier and more comfortable
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.920]   when we're older and infirm.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.760]   And go ahead, Algen.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.260]   - I would just say basically self-funding,
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.460]   it has to be factored into the retirement plan,
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:57.260]   having sufficient assets to provide for that,
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.580]   self-insuring in essence,
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.700]   and making sure you have enough to fill the gap.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.680]   - All right, any further questions
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.540]   on proceeding conversation topic?
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.700]   If not, I guess we can move on to the next topic,
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:16.960]   which should be of interest
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.320]   in our technologically advancing world.
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.520]   - Yeah, I do have Zoom meetings with my dad, who's 89.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.140]   So yeah, things are changing.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.400]   But, and this will be brief, more brief,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.460]   but Jason and I chatted a little bit about
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.660]   some of our views on how we see technology
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.020]   impacting financial planning.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.900]   Our business model, I mean,
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:45.380]   it's clearly based upon using technology efficiently.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.500]   That's what our clients do,
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.080]   like you did and so on.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:53.740]   And how you use video to support getting going with this.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.580]   But it's this idea of financial planning,
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.500]   which is a part of what we do,
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.160]   it is my suspicion that in the future,
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.420]   there will be apps that will essentially
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.380]   make a lot of these decisions for us.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.280]   Right now, they're not there yet.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.840]   And I think it's gonna take quite a while
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.780]   to be able to integrate the different moving parts together,
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:17.440]   or at least a firm hasn't figured out yet
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.760]   if they invest a lot of the money
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.200]   that would be required to do this,
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.440]   that they're gonna get paid on this yet.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   Now, eMoney is a competitive,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.920]   it's one of the more competitive products
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.760]   in the financial advisor space.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.560]   Money Guide Pro is another good one and some other ones.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.600]   And these tools are really good at doing planning
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.840]   and they have a lot of functionality.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.840]   And right now they're used through firms like PlanVision
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.580]   and other advisory firms to work with their clients.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.280]   But I would guess that in the future,
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.840]   there's going to be tools where consumers
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.740]   can go directly to the app themselves
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.440]   and will be able to do a lot of their own
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.640]   financial planning themselves.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.640]   Artificial intelligence, I assume will be some part of that.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.520]   The challenge may be the interpretation
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.920]   of some of the information or the data,
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.960]   which actually is still a lot of what we do.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.280]   When we have these collaborative sessions with our clients,
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.740]   they've kind of moved all the way along
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.440]   and we're just helping interpret a lot of the information
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.920]   and providing comments on what they're seeing.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.320]   But I certainly think that consumers are gonna be able
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.120]   to take a lot more ownership
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.840]   over their financial plans in the future.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.320]   And this process of looking at your assets,
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.560]   oh, how are they going to play out?
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.220]   Am I going to run out of money?
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.060]   Oh, and then you have to go over
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.940]   and look at your investments and say, well, okay,
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.320]   based upon that, I got to make this decision
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.280]   and then I should structure my assets.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.640]   I think that's going to be integrated a lot better
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.680]   in the future, where it'd be a lot more simple.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.080]   So an example of where this might go
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.240]   would be for younger people,
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.200]   people that have debt in their 20s and 30s.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.200]   There may be a point where the technology
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.160]   will essentially make that decision for them
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.200]   on whether or not they should pay off a loan early
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.640]   or invest their money.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:09.280]   And that might be, who knows?
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.520]   It might be a model that might change
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.720]   based upon the dynamics of the markets
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.720]   and that kind of thing.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.560]   So that's one area where I see technology improving that.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:24.960]   And our firm is trying to be on the front of that too
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   in how we use technology.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.200]   But basically allowing people
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.960]   to do their own financial planning for the most part.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.120]   And some of you probably use your own,
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.480]   some of these online calculators,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.720]   which are getting better all the time
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.360]   and allow them to do quite a bit.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:47.120]   This process of taking money out of your account,
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.840]   I would suspect that that would be simplified as well.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.240]   The distribution mechanism,
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.160]   it is somewhat simplified right now.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.520]   I would guess there are some people here
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.040]   that are getting automatic payments right now
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.200]   on their retirement plans.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.440]   They don't have to think about anything.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.920]   It just comes out automatically for them.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:12.560]   But my guess is that distribution management
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.320]   and what account you take money from
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.360]   and which actual asset you take it
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.840]   will be taken care of in the future.
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.520]   And as a part of that,
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.240]   the tax implications of that as well.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:29.320]   Again, this is all kind of tied into financial management
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.640]   or financial planning management as well,
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.080]   but more on the distribution side.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.720]   That the technology will be developed
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.120]   to integrate all this information together
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:43.520]   so that the consumer needs to make less decisions
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.520]   about where to take money from and when to take it.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.720]   So I would suspect that there's gonna be improvements
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.440]   in distribution management as well.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.680]   And I guess as a part of that as well,
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:04.080]   if I didn't say this, is tax management too.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.360]   That taxes will be much more automated in the future
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.600]   than they are right now.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.040]   I mean, Jason, you worked at, was it TurboTax?
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.400]   - Yeah, I worked at TurboTax
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.280]   and I was a tax expert with them.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.120]   - Yeah.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.920]   - And yeah, TurboTax is fantastic.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.480]   They've got the internal revenue code built in
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.520]   and merely by asking questions, asking the right questions,
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.240]   the software walks you through.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.000]   There can be some very complicated returns
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.760]   that people are able to do
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   if they answer the questions correctly.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.400]   The decision though, on what to do.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.240]   - Yeah.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.640]   - AI has to come a lot, lot further along.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.000]   But as far as actually tax compliance, yeah.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.800]   I mean, it's phenomenal what the big firms do.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.080]   TurboTax, H&R Block, all the software.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:10:59.920]   - Yeah.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.760]   - For sure.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.600]   - Thousand ways to go.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.960]   And actually we are, you know, we use Salesforce.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.400]   And for those that use Salesforce,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.400]   man, that is an awesome program.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.560]   And that's integral to how we manage our business.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.840]   But we're having some initial discussions
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.880]   with our Salesforce developer
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.480]   on how we can have more interactive data gathering sessions
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.360]   with our, like, I mean, the Salesforce tech system
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.000]   in gathering information from our clients,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.560]   integrating that into our system
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.180]   and then providing them with advice.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:37.520]   So that's a form of artificial intelligence, I guess.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.460]   Even though it's somewhat, it's somewhat,
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.300]   you know, crude at this point.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.700]   I've joked with some of my clients
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.860]   that hopefully someday I won't have to meet with them.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.300]   But, so those are, you know,
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:55.700]   we'll see where this thing goes,
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:59.620]   but the financial services industry
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.660]   managed to escape the dot com craze.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.980]   And all these advisors that thought
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.060]   they were going to lose their jobs,
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:05.900]   oh, they're still around.
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.180]   They still want to talk to us.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.020]   But slowly it's encroaching on the industry.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.220]   And there's more pressure on them.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.220]   My gosh, with the robos,
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:18.220]   who I think are a much better option for people
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:23.420]   than going to, you know, sit in some advisor's office
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.020]   and charge you 1%.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.940]   A robo really compressed that fee.
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.820]   And now it's coming down to, you know,
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.860]   30 basis points, 25, 20.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.940]   And, you know, you can, if you're,
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.140]   if you just want a simple fund,
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.100]   you can go to Target Date Fund, which is what I use.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.380]   So a lot of pressure
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.660]   on the investment management side of this,
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.860]   but I think you're going to feel,
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.980]   see a lot more pressure as well,
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.620]   just on financial planning and guidance
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.420]   with artificial intelligence
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:54.180]   and the kind of the ability for programs like e-money
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.980]   to be done at the consumer's level.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.820]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.580]   And to add onto that,
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:10.380]   younger generations are far more willing to use apps
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.340]   on their phones to apply for mortgages.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:18.340]   Look, you can do your tax return, kind of complicated,
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.540]   your tax return with an app.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:25.220]   You take a picture of your W-2 and documents,
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.500]   the program will upload them.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.780]   You have to review it, of course,
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.420]   but younger people, not me,
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.820]   younger people are willing to do a lot with apps
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.660]   that as older folks,
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.820]   we want to sit across the desk or the Zoom call,
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.620]   but they're doing,
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.580]   AI is going to get there where you can do a lot more.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:46.100]   They can do a lot more with the apps.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.740]   So technology is clearly rolling forward.
[01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.580]   - Yeah.
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.940]   So anyways, those are just some thoughts,
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.140]   not too much to add there,
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.620]   but I think there's going to be a lot of pressure
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.500]   even on the financial planning side.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.180]   Now, maybe a ways down the road
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:06.900]   in the financial services industry
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.340]   where bubble heads won't have much left to talk about.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.580]   - Oh, we'll still talk.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.740]   (laughing)
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.100]   - There's always oatmeal and Costco chicken.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.780]   (laughing)
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.580]   - And whether you should invest in international funds.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:24.260]   - Exactly.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.940]   - Shall we open it up for questions?
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.420]   Lady Geek has her hand up.
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.260]   - Yeah.
[01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:34.420]   Okay, technology and a site administrator.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.060]   Perfect confluence.
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:36.900]   Okay.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.620]   Also, I'm also into,
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:40.180]   I promote the Bubble Heads wiki.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.780]   I'm a wiki admin.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.340]   But one thing, everybody,
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:46.060]   you're using the magic words of artificial intelligence
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.500]   and that's something I'm a little bit more familiar with.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:52.460]   But what I don't hear are the magic words
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.140]   in financial planning to start,
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.820]   'cause you're talking about investments,
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:59.500]   you're talking about taxes.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.220]   What I don't hear is an app that says,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.900]   that basically follows the financial planning article
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.180]   in the Bubble Heads wiki,
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:09.220]   which is first, do you have an emergency fund?
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.780]   Are you paying off your debts?
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.580]   What app can you give to a new person,
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.660]   like high school, college,
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.020]   that basically is gonna load in
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.700]   a ton of your financial information?
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.860]   So that's a privacy thing.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.460]   But something that takes into account
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:24.860]   everything you're doing right now.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.820]   What's your salary?
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.060]   Can you meet a monthly budget?
[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.980]   Budgeting, personal capital.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.780]   But are you ready to invest?
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.340]   You go, okay, you go to Betterment.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:37.100]   No, you're not ready for Betterment yet
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.300]   because you don't have six months of emergency.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.020]   What's in your bank account?
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.460]   Oh, well, I can sort of eat chicken this week.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:48.820]   So I don't hear the words to tell a new person
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.900]   or a person just getting on their feet
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.380]   to say, no, no, don't get a mortgage.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.900]   Your renting is fine.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.540]   Where is the app that follows what I tell people
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.820]   in the Bobo Heads forums?
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.020]   Getting started.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:06.140]   Don't just type it in the search box,
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.020]   financial planning, also planners,
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.300]   and see those basic steps.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.340]   So I mean, I know Mark,
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.260]   it's beautiful applications
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.260]   and all your tools and everything.
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.260]   It's helping you run your business
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.980]   and helping people.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.380]   But I don't hear the words,
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.580]   oh, first of all, I'm retired
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.900]   and I'm in a good situation here,
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.540]   but I don't hear the words to tell a person
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.020]   you're not ready, that says don't invest.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.300]   I don't hear the words.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.420]   Here's how to save.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.460]   Are you meeting your budget?
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.740]   So let me give, I say Bobo Heads, we're very vocal.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:43.740]   And I'm trying to help point things in that approach.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:48.380]   Apps are focused on investing.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.380]   Apps are focused on taxes.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.780]   Where's the app that puts everything together
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:54.420]   like a super app or, you know,
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.780]   I can give all kinds of terms for that,
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.300]   but let's start.
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:00.980]   - Is this a question?
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:01.820]   Is there a-
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.500]   - Yeah, it's a question.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.860]   Well, we also give a lot of, it's just something,
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.100]   maybe you hit a trigger point in me,
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.180]   but that's what I'm trying to-
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.700]   - Actually, I have the answer to that, Lady Geek.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.300]   - Okay. - It's not an app yet,
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.340]   but I have to give a shout out to William Bernstein,
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:22.420]   because this is what I show Lady Geek
[01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.260]   and all the Vogel Heads.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:26.420]   This is what I show to many of our new clients,
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.340]   especially the younger ones.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.460]   And I say, look, take an hour to read this.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.660]   If you don't live in the US,
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.820]   ignore the references to the US tax code,
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.460]   but the five hurdles will apply to you.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.020]   And it's not an app, maybe I should write the app
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.740]   and split it with Mr. Bernstein.
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.260]   But this is what you're talking about.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.940]   We just needed an app form.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:50.620]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.940]   It's a free download, you know?
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:52.780]   Yeah, yeah, so-
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:55.260]   - Yeah, I know, but I got to show them a beautiful picture
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.980]   before I email it to them.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.100]   - So you say, that's what I said, very,
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.780]   it's just that I hear different things.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.540]   I guess everybody has a different perspective
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.060]   and I like to work from top down.
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.660]   My background is just in engineering, so I retired.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.220]   So I work at a big picture level
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.940]   and try and flow things down.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:15.940]   So I want to get these people off on the right path
[01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.460]   before you send them down the path.
[01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.100]   That's all I was trying to do.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.820]   And maybe there's something that has this existing,
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:23.660]   that's fine.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:27.420]   - Yeah, that's what I would kind of what I'm alluding to
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:31.340]   is that there would be some sort of tool
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.900]   that some firms will begin to develop
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.060]   that would be based upon where you're at in life.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.220]   And so if you're 21 and you start your financial planning
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.060]   that it would say,
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.500]   oh, well, you don't have enough money in the bank
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.900]   and you can't invest because you have,
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:46.060]   you know, a four and a half percent student loan,
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.180]   you'll deal with that first.
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.300]   That's my assumption of where this is all going
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.700]   with technology.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:53.060]   Is that it'll be based upon where you're at in life
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.980]   and it'll, you won't have any,
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.140]   like I'm being glib here,
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:58.020]   but you won't have any decisions to make.
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.500]   Your thing will just say to you,
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.500]   oh, what are you doing?
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.620]   You don't need to be doing that.
[01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.620]   You can't spend that money.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.900]   Get back in your house.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:05.980]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.300]   And one other aspect of financial planning
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.820]   actually includes estate planning.
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.620]   I like to encompass everything.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.180]   Should you think about this about when you're 25?
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.660]   - That'll be quite an app.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:16.620]   - Yes, it will.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.940]   And it's a huge, but I say,
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.620]   should you be thinking about estate planning at 25?
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:21.460]   Oh, yes.
[01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.900]   - Yes, especially for the people that have children,
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.060]   because if you don't have your guardians,
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.220]   you have no business to even open an account
[01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:35.260]   because, you know, that's critical.
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.100]   - Yeah.
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.140]   - So I agree.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.020]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:38.980]   I feel much better now.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:39.820]   Thank you.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:45.260]   - There's a, Jim posted a URL there for a flow chart.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.180]   I think it's for younger people as well
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.500]   to walk through some of these decision points.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.980]   One thing I'm curious about,
[01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.980]   us bogleheads as a rule are generally financially savvy,
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:59.420]   otherwise we wouldn't be here or wanting to be,
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.660]   but we represent a small minority
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.660]   of the average population.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.180]   So even with artificial intelligence and apps,
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.180]   I still think there's gonna be a tremendous need
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.100]   for advisors like yourself, if not in person,
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.860]   for handholding and explaining and coercing people
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:18.820]   to follow the recommendations.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.260]   - Yeah, the notion that there's just like
[01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.860]   some sort of an orb that describes your financial life
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.300]   for you and you carry it around with you
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.940]   and it hovers and tells you where to,
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.700]   that might be 250 years away, like way out there.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:37.780]   But yes, I think there's always financial guidance
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.540]   at some level or another for many folks.
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.460]   You know, it's interesting, but who is it?
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:49.100]   Bill Gross, the PIMCO guy, he's the CEO.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.540]   Yeah, he has, it's a funny story, but I-
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.820]   - I'm a PIMCO guy.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.580]   - Yeah, I'm a PIMCO guy.
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:56.820]   Yeah, but when I was at Valek,
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.260]   they brought in to speak his financial advisor.
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.060]   The guy had a financial advisor.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:06.260]   So yeah, I think there's a role for financial,
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.900]   however you wanna characterize that person
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.060]   or the role that they play for individuals,
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.980]   for many people, whether they're bogal heads
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.820]   or people that aren't bogal heads.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.380]   - By the way, I wanna add, we're continuing the recording.
[01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.460]   For anybody who, let's just go ahead
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:23.580]   and you can raise your hand or ask questions in the chat.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:26.740]   If you wanna be on camera and wanna maintain privacy,
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:29.100]   you can turn off your video and/or change your name.
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.940]   But I think the recording will be worthwhile
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.260]   for other people to watch.
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:36.220]   - And what is interesting to finish the thought, Alan,
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:38.100]   about that, 'cause some of the folks are chiming in here
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:40.140]   about the role of professional.
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.700]   It is, yeah, personal finance is very personal.
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.500]   Gosh, we'll talk with, I will have meetings back to back
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:51.380]   with people that have attitudes that are 180 degrees
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.660]   different about their investments
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.860]   and how they're gonna spend their money.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.820]   And yeah, and they may have an entirely different set
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:02.140]   of questions, even though their financial situations
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.780]   might even be relatively similar.
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:09.660]   - We have a question on web-based financial services
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.380]   that integrate a person's investment accounts.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:17.660]   Has there been any significant security breaches
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.780]   in these services resulting in the compromise
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.780]   of the investment accounts?
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:26.540]   - Well, I'm not aware of any.
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.380]   If you're talking, yeah, if you're talking about
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.420]   like the personal capitals of the world,
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.620]   maybe companies like e-money or I'm not aware
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:35.980]   of any breaches that have occurred.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.140]   It doesn't mean it hasn't happened,
[01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:41.900]   but it hasn't gotten news to the level
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.100]   that I would have heard about it.
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:46.540]   - Mark, I'm curious, since you have the option
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.620]   for most of your clients for them to connect
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.220]   to the aggregator in e-money,
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:55.420]   what percentage entered in manually versus actually connect?
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.100]   - I would say probably, I don't keep track of that, Alan,
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.900]   but I would probably say it's between 10 and 20%
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.780]   that manually type them in.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:08.580]   And you know, our program e-money
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.780]   and the other ones too, probably,
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.540]   they're actually pretty easy to use
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:13.780]   if you type in your stuff manually.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.740]   It doesn't really take that long
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.060]   once you do it a few times.
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:20.340]   Of course, a lot of people like the updating feature,
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.940]   so both can work fine.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:29.820]   - Alrighty, further questions, folks?
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.260]   - Well, Jim K wanted to know why he had to establish
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.340]   an emergency fund before going with GameStop.
[01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:43.380]   - Well, I, as an, I don't know if it's an aside,
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:48.300]   but we actually, a very good friend of mine
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.620]   runs a hedge fund, right, as it were.
[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.260]   And so I interviewed him, Stu,
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.220]   and he's a podcast on our site, to talk about this,
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:58.460]   because man, when that was going on,
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.140]   I thought to myself, there is so much being made
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:04.300]   about this, and it's, there's just not a lot of depth
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.140]   to this whole thing.
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.860]   And it was, to me, it was almost like watching
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.740]   a Netflix show, you know, unfold.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:14.620]   You have these crazy folks in the Reddit website
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.700]   that are, you know, going after,
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.180]   going after a hedge fund.
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.300]   So it's just, it's kind of a weird dynamic,
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.220]   but I don't think there was a lot of substance to it,
[01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.700]   but it certainly got a lot of attention.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.860]   - You know, I've got a question.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.380]   I know eMoney is owned, I think, by Fidelity, actually.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.500]   So you're dependent upon their developers
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.180]   to add capabilities.
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.140]   I'm just curious, from your business perspective,
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.460]   how much feedback are they getting
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.860]   from individual advisors,
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.020]   asking for additional, you know, capabilities being added?
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:57.740]   Is it functional as much as you'd like it to be, or?
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.020]   - I'm-
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:03.900]   - Are you handcuffed by whatever they decide to put in?
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:08.380]   - No, they're always doing updates,
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.700]   both software rollouts.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:15.540]   Recently, in fact, just now, they're rolling out
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:19.540]   what they call a modernization of their report format,
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.900]   just to make it much cleaner.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:26.900]   But there's a request that advisors can put in
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:32.900]   and if the request is already in, you just can vote it.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.980]   You upvote it.
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.740]   If you think, yeah, that's a great idea,
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.820]   they need to add that.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.340]   Here's an example.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:45.180]   eMoney has almost, not quite an unlimited number
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.460]   of types of retirement plans,
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:51.980]   but the 457(b) is not actually an option.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.180]   So when I contacted them, they said,
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.620]   "Oh yeah, that's a popular request.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:57.500]   "We are working on it.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.100]   "So just go into the survey, click on upvote
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.620]   "to put more votes behind it."
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:05.700]   And by popular opinion or popular demand,
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.020]   eMoney does direct improvements
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.220]   based on what the advisors are requesting.
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:17.180]   - And Alan, to add on that, I'm very impressed with eMoney.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.780]   Their internal support is awesome
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:24.860]   and they do a really good job, I think,
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.020]   with their technology.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:30.500]   So they're great to work with from a vendor's perspective.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:34.620]   - No, I've generally been impressed with it.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.180]   I use Personal Capital also,
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:40.180]   which has some surprisingly robust tools
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:44.500]   for the individual DIYer, it's very helpful.
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.860]   I hope that all these platforms,
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.300]   we just, the Chicago Virtual Society,
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.860]   Jim's chapter has been exploring a number
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:58.100]   of various tools available. - Tools.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:00.780]   - And they have the new retirement folks on as well,
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.620]   which is interesting.
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.620]   Of course, they're developing that totally in-house.
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:05.780]   Probably don't have the resources
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:07.460]   that Fidelity and eMoney have,
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:09.820]   but it's nice to see multiple different platforms
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:12.620]   being developed and hopefully the competition
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:16.380]   will continue to push each one to a higher level.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.140]   - There was a question here about the podcast.
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:23.940]   We have just been doing the podcast for our clients only,
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:26.940]   but it's, we're going public now.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.820]   And so we're right now on iHeartRadio
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.820]   and Spotify, and we're trying to get out,
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:40.660]   like our, whoever does our distribution is trying to,
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:45.140]   that's actually the website, Alan.
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.740]   They can't get the podcast there.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.580]   - Right, oh.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:49.260]   - Okay, yeah. - Right.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:54.220]   - So Jason put a note there, but on, we just,
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:56.180]   I'm not kidding, like in the last four days,
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:58.740]   we went on iHeartRadio, and then before that Spotify.
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.700]   We'll be on Apple, and yeah, Apple's the big one, iTunes,
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.420]   and then Google, and then there's another one.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:05.580]   So we'll be on five podcasts soon, but it's just,
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:06.500]   it's planned vision.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.940]   I don't know how, I don't use podcasts much,
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.220]   so I don't know how you find them,
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.260]   but I think you just type in the name, I suppose,
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:13.420]   and we'll pop up there.
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.860]   - Yeah, it's interesting with all the podcasts,
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.460]   and now a lot of them are going on YouTube,
[01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.020]   the kind of, people are getting saturated, I think,
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.060]   with content, and it's hard to sort it all out.
[01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:29.060]   - Yeah, you're right, yeah.
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.660]   - But I've listened to a number of your,
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:32.420]   the private podcasts for your clients,
[01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:34.020]   and they're excellent, and they're short and sweet,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:37.700]   which is nice, little snippets of good information.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.540]   I don't know if you-- - You know, I did that--
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.700]   - In that format.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.980]   - I did that because when I was,
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:46.660]   well, the last six years of my life, I worked so much,
[01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:48.300]   that I don't have time for anything else,
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.820]   so I thought, well, I'll just do these short podcasts,
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.580]   'cause that's what I could listen to.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.740]   Lee, a client of ours,
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.580]   for clients who have worked with you for a while,
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.460]   what have they said they would do differently
[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.240]   if they could retire again?
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.660]   Does that mean,
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:11.100]   like, would they retire later if they could,
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.540]   or retire sooner?
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.180]   - I don't know, I guess I can just,
[01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.420]   the vibe I get from some of my clients
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:25.420]   is some of them don't feel prepared for retirement.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.540]   And I don't mean financially.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:33.020]   I mean, they're not ready to not work anymore.
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.540]   They're scared of it.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.700]   Some of them, man, best thing they ever did
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:37.940]   was stop working. - Right.
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:41.300]   But for retiring, for people that have been working
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.420]   for 20, 30, 40, 50 years,
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.220]   working is part of your identity
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.420]   and who you are. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:52.300]   - And the psychologists say, do not retire from something,
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.380]   the job that's grinding you down.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:56.380]   You need to retire to something
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.740]   and be emotionally committed to whatever that is.
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.940]   And it might be volunteering, it might be teaching,
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.280]   it might be another job.
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.700]   It might be crocheting at home.
[01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.860]   Whatever it is, you have to be emotionally engaged
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.620]   and be excited to get out of bed
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:11.460]   to do whatever it is you're gonna do.
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.340]   - Yeah, great.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.380]   If people have the opportunity,
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:18.020]   a great thing to do is have a practice retirement
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.420]   where if you are able to slow down a little bit at work
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.660]   and devote more time to those pursuits
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.060]   that you think you want to continue with
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:27.180]   to see how it goes and be flexible.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.180]   I know, I thought I knew exactly what I was gonna do
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.860]   during retirement and I had a whole list of things
[01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.220]   and I've probably only done 10% of them,
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.980]   but I've added 90% of other things I hadn't anticipated,
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.100]   of course, forced by the pandemic,
[01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.220]   but you have to be flexible.
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:44.100]   I think that's the key, regardless.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.060]   And creative.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:49.380]   - Yeah, I've been very inspired by many of the people
[01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:51.100]   that I've interacted with over the years
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.620]   who are still working.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:55.620]   In fact, one of the clients I met
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.100]   when I started a group business was this,
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.960]   he's, gosh, he's gotta be 75 now,
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.060]   but they hired him when he was a 71-year-old former judge
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.060]   from Hennepin County here in Minnesota
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.620]   to be the executive director of a small nonprofit.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.140]   So I interviewed this guy and one of the things he,
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:11.980]   like he, the staff can't keep up with him
[01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:16.860]   and he said he's very insecure about his job.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:20.420]   And he said he feels like he has to justify
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:24.940]   to the board all the time why they hired this old guy,
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.780]   is what he said.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.420]   I hired this old guy, I gotta keep on busting my ass
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:31.260]   so they can justify why they hired me.
[01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:33.460]   So, but a lot of people like that,
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.520]   just very inspiring people that continue to work
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.020]   in some capacity.
[01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.420]   Or other folks that leave and really find something
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:42.540]   that they enjoy that kind of re-energizes them
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.780]   and reinvents them a bit.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:49.580]   That is one of the gratifying parts of the work
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:51.500]   that I do is, and Jason does,
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.100]   is to interact with these folks.
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:54.940]   It's pretty cool.
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:59.520]   - Found everything that you've said to be very accurate.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.140]   It was very difficult for me to retire
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:06.520]   and I didn't for many years for that reason.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.620]   And my husband went back to work.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:13.620]   So, after he's home, we do have another question.
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:17.820]   What is the name of the insurance calculator
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.180]   that Jason referenced?
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.660]   - Oh, that's right.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.260]   - Yep, I did put that up there.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.140]   It's right-
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.420]   - Oh, I see, okay.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:26.820]   - At 933.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:27.660]   - Okay.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:31.260]   - And that's, they just updated it to accommodate
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:34.980]   the change with the ARP, the American Rescue Plan.
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.220]   They did update it.
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.500]   And again, it is a tool.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.540]   It's not the be all end all,
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:45.380]   but it's pretty remarkable if you plug in your zip code.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:49.220]   - Hey, I wanna make a comment
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:50.900]   about this whole retirement talk
[01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:54.100]   because this has happened several times in my career.
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.220]   Even before I did plan vision,
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:58.260]   I was doing financial advising with Valak.
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.940]   One of the benefits of going through the exercise
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:02.900]   of doing a plan pre-retirement,
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.040]   whether it's eight years, six years, five years,
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.460]   to kind of get some clarification on the numbers,
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.620]   things change at work.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:14.820]   Your health might change, culture might change, new boss.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.940]   You wake up one day and the world looks different.
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:21.940]   And I've had several people that send me an email
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:24.100]   and say, "You know, I'd like to go over the numbers again
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.100]   'cause I think I wanna go."
[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.940]   Something happened and that's, you know, the plans change.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:31.380]   So that's on the early side.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:32.220]   Was that you, Miriam,
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:34.220]   that's saying you had difficulty leaving?
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:36.400]   - Oh, yes, it was impossible.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.920]   For the reason you said that you are identified
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:44.160]   with your profession, with your job, with what you do.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:49.160]   It is, what, 32 years, 34 years of my life.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.000]   - Yeah.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.820]   - Also, I felt that I had so much to offer.
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.880]   I had so much knowledge, so much experience.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.960]   - To offer, I was good for the world if I kept working.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.360]   It was good for, you know, it was just a good thing to do.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.040]   And why would I waste my education
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.100]   and all my experience to retire?
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:10.940]   - Yeah.
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:14.300]   - And yet it was time.
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.040]   - So did you end up working two, three, four years longer
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.720]   than you needed to or felt like you should have?
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.740]   - I worked until I was aged out.
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.520]   - Oh.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.200]   - I worked until I was aged out.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.800]   My husband, but then went back to work.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.140]   And he still works.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:38.100]   - Yeah, I was very impacted by a speech I heard
[01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.180]   in the late '90s by a hospital administrator
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:42.220]   from a small town in Minnesota.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.860]   And it's hard for me to not get emotional
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.500]   thinking about this.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:50.140]   But he was, he explained, he had retired.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.060]   He came back to talk.
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.380]   And he came back to talk about his retirement.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.060]   But he was relating the story about his first week
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.580]   and his month and his first three months
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.820]   of not doing his job anymore and how devastated he was.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:04.500]   He was the hospital administrator
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.980]   in a small to mid-sized town in Minnesota.
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.140]   And so he knew everyone.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.580]   And he was a part of everyone's life.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:13.640]   And nobody called him anymore for his help anymore.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.420]   And it just did, yeah, it just demoralized him.
[01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:18.160]   - He knew so much.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:22.860]   He could have done so much good for so many more people
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.780]   for such a long time.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.580]   And yet now he's not doing that.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.420]   - Yeah.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:31.420]   It's a feeling of like, it just, you know,
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.700]   the song "Blowing in the Wind."
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.740]   It's just, you know, it's all just blowing in the wind now.
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.560]   - Of course.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.300]   And when people, for some people,
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.000]   when they do this transition, now they're getting old.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.100]   - No.
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:44.700]   - Retiring is for my parents.
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:46.200]   - Exactly.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.940]   By the way, for those that haven't come across this guy
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.780]   before, some of you may.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.660]   One of the best speakers I've ever seen is Ken Dykewald.
[01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:58.660]   And Ken is the founder of Age Wave.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:01.180]   And he's been speaking on the baby boom generation,
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:02.780]   their influence on our economy.
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:06.460]   But he's a wonderful speaker and a very influential speaker
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:09.820]   on how people age and what aging is now,
[01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.420]   as opposed to what it was 30 years ago and 60 years ago
[01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:13.540]   and 90 years ago.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.060]   Wonderful speaker.
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.460]   And you can go to YouTube and search him by name
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.620]   and watch some of his speeches.
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:22.860]   They're very moving when he presents.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.820]   He's a big buck speaker, but man, he is powerful.
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:28.660]   And he talks about how people's attitudes
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:32.440]   have such a big impact on their quality of life
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:33.940]   as they age.
[01:36:33.940 --> 01:36:36.220]   And he has great examples of, my gosh,
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.860]   these people that are part of our popular culture
[01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:42.580]   that are still 75 and 85, and they're still,
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:46.200]   they're still significant and making a difference.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.860]   - I'm curious something with, amongst your clients,
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.420]   do you have any that have embraced the FIRE movement
[01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.100]   or at least the Achieving Financial Independence part?
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.980]   And what are your thoughts on that?
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.020]   - You mean that cult?
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.860]   Actually, they're wonderful.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.940]   I mean, that's one of the things about
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:13.420]   how the web hasn't impacted personal finance
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.740]   is that it's been a way for a lot of these people
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.580]   to kind of get together and realize,
[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.220]   oh, there are other people that want to do this as well.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:24.420]   And of course you have a lot of the bloggers
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:28.140]   like Mr. Money Mustache, who's the leader of that,
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:29.700]   the kind of leader of all that.
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.420]   But yeah, we work with a lot of the FIRE people.
[01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.180]   And we do plans for them, 'cause we have popped up
[01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.100]   in a lot of the Facebook groups there.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:43.100]   And what they have going for them is many of them
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.800]   live well within their means.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.820]   My gosh, they're saving 40, 50, 60%.
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.260]   A lot of them are doing indexing.
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.840]   They've been influenced by Jim Collins,
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:57.540]   who's got a good message about investing,
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.960]   or JL Collins, excuse me.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:03.320]   So yeah, we have a lot of FIRE clients and it's,
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:10.260]   I was using the term cult in a positive way, I guess.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:15.580]   But yeah, they're just folks that are very interested
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:18.080]   in financial flexibility.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.580]   - Yeah, interesting.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.300]   By the way, one thing, an expression I've heard
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.740]   when it comes to like revisiting early on
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:27.500]   your retirement savings and ability to retire
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:29.580]   is to get to the point, it might've been,
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.220]   you've been JL Collins who used the term,
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.900]   I'm not sure, the F-U money,
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:35.820]   getting to the point where you have the option to retire.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.220]   And that can relieve a lot of anxiety
[01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:41.660]   and give you a way out if need be.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:43.940]   Just something else to consider
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.860]   and a reason to build a financial plan
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:49.280]   and analyze it on a regular basis if need be.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.480]   - Yeah, quick story was I was doing a review
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.480]   with a couple of good clients of mine,
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.880]   but they're in their late fifties.
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.840]   And I was kind of moved by them
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.740]   because they are in a tough spot.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:06.480]   They've been squeezed and they just know
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.920]   that they're gonna have to work longer,
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.960]   even though they have a really good attitude.
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.760]   But I had two meetings with them.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.120]   One was with both of them,
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.720]   and then one was just with her.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:20.920]   And I could just tell from my interactions with her
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.500]   how their financial situation had taken a toll on her.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.240]   There was just no way around it.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.920]   And money can do this to people.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.120]   Your finances can create so much pressure.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.920]   So if people live within their means,
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.940]   if they don't have any debt,
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.840]   if they save a good emergency fund,
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.300]   if they've been good savers,
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.600]   at least that's one aspect of their life
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:47.120]   where they won't necessarily have to feel pressure
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.320]   if things aren't working out well for them.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.900]   But if things are, if they're struggling personally
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.600]   or in relationships with their family
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.560]   or their job or something,
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.700]   to have mounting debt
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.800]   or never feel like you're ever getting ahead,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.660]   man, that is so damaging to people's health.
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:07.120]   - Financial problems are not just money, it's-
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:10.860]   - Yeah, they carry over.
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:18.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:23.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.740]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.060]   (upbeat music)
