[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Well, how should we consider our life regrets?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.680]   The small regrets, the big regrets, the medium regrets.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.360]   We all have regrets of various sizes.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760]   The question comes in from Marvin, a podcast listener.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.420]   I'm a 72-year-old man with four grown children.
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.600]   My wife is with the Lord now.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.360]   All in all, my life has been good, and I think I served the Lord for a lot of those years,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.740]   but I can look back on many opportunities I missed in life.
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.320]   Business trips I didn't take, missionaries I didn't support, even professional opportunities
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.100]   I did not take and probably should have, ways to better invest and redeem my time at every
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560]   stage along the way.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.040]   At my age, I harbor a bunch of little regrets about my past.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.220]   All those small regrets add up and leave me wondering.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.200]   Is it possible for an older man to look back over his life and conclude that I frequently
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.540]   missed God's will over the years?
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.500]   Or is who I am now the will of God perfectly manifested in all my decisions, and therefore
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.640]   I should have no regrets at all?
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.700]   How should an old man in Christ who believes in the sovereign orchestration of God's providence
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.800]   look back on his failures and his missed opportunities?"
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.480]   Well, as you can imagine, this strikes very close to home.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.040]   He's, what, 72, and I'm 73.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.480]   I am that man, right?
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.240]   Marvin and I are both in our early 70s.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.520]   We both look back over most of our lives already being lived, I mean way most, and nothing,
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.920]   this is what hits me sometimes so hard, nothing, absolutely nothing we do can change the past.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.280]   It sometimes hits me with tremendous force.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.360]   My 33-year chapter as a pastor is complete.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.280]   It had a beginning, 1980, it had an ending, 2013, and every second of it, every word spoken,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.380]   every attitude felt, every deed done or undone is written in the books of heaven, and they
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.960]   are more fixed and unchangeable than Mount Everest.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.560]   Nothing I do, nothing, makes those years better or worse.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.560]   That's an awesome thought.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   That's an awesome thought.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.800]   I mean, it's obvious this can be, right?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.960]   Duh, but it doesn't hit you until you're almost done with life and you look back and say,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.920]   "I used to think in terms of, 'I'm going to make my pastor better.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920]   I'm going to be better.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.920]   I'm going to get better.'"
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.000]   Well, it's over.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.800]   You're not going to make it better.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.280]   It's over.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.840]   You're not going to make those 33 years better or worse, and so Marvin is just forcing the
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   issue again.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.520]   Thank you, Marvin.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.520]   It's good for me.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   It's really good for me.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.960]   At this point in my understanding of how to look back at the past, I have four things
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.640]   that I can make fit into an APJ.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.560]   Number one, let's begin, Marvin, by remembering that we have the kind of Savior and the kind
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.280]   of salvation that says to the thief on the cross, just hours before he dies, "Today you
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.680]   will be with me in paradise."
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.600]   Think of it.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   Just before he dies, he realizes that everything, everything in his past is regrettable.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.580]   Everything.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.220]   Nothing was done from faith.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.920]   Nothing was done for the glory of Christ, and he will be with Jesus forever, welcomed.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.040]   That's an amazing reality, unspeakably sweet reality of grace.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.320]   If you, Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand Psalm 130?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   That's where we start, Marvin.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.960]   We just start there.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.440]   Christ died to cover a thousand regrets.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.920]   Ten thousand.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.340]   A million.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:18.040]   Number two, Marvin, your memory and my memory and everybody's memory of our past is utterly
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.320]   unreliable.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.100]   If you start to try to measure the spiritual successes and failures of your past, the good
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.160]   versus the bad, the loving versus the unloving, the helpful versus the unhelpful, you're kidding
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.280]   yourself.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.400]   My memory, your memory is utterly not up to the task for four reasons.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.540]   One, many of my sins were hidden from me.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.160]   Who can discern his errors, declare me innocent of hidden faults, Psalm 19.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.960]   Number two, I have long forgotten many things entirely.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.000]   Paul said, Paul, Paul said, 1 Corinthians 1:16, "I did baptize also the house of Stephanas."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.080]   Beyond that, I don't know whether I baptized anyone.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.600]   Thank you.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.080]   Paul didn't remember who he baptized.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.120]   Well, there are 10,000 things I don't remember, which may have been good or may have been
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.120]   bad.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   I can't remember them.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.720]   I'm absolutely hopeless if I try to rehearse my past and add things up like that.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.440]   The third reason, my heart is deceitful, recalls something good that weren't good.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.520]   I'm going to deceive myself.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.360]   Jeremiah 17, the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.680]   Who can understand it?
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.960]   And the fourth reason, Paul ponders his own record of faithfulness.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.880]   And here's what he says, 1 Corinthians 4, 4, "I'm not aware of anything against myself,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.440]   but I'm not thereby acquitted, is the Lord who judges me."
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.960]   In other words, even a good memory and a good record is not decisive.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   Christ is decisive.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.520]   So beware of thinking too highly of your memory, whether good or bad.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:23.000]   Third, it's good to remember our sins and feel regret.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's good.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Good to feel regret.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.880]   Up to a point, and I say this again for four reasons.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.320]   One, a life without regrets is built on a mirage.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.680]   If you don't see sins when you're looking back over your life and you don't regret those
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.320]   sins, you're not seeing reality.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.720]   You're not feeling reality.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.520]   You're seeing a mirage.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.560]   We all have sinned.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.080]   There were plenty of attitudes, words, deeds that were not for the glory of God, but selfish,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.640]   not loving, but uncaring, not from faith, but from fear.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.920]   Plenty of things that came out of your mouth that were not designed for up-building, plenty
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.680]   of good paths taken with defective motives.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.360]   A life without regrets is a life built on a mirage.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:21.200]   Second, Paul said to the Gentile converts in Ephesus, Ephesians 2, "Remember that you
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.000]   were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.480]   to the covenants of promise, having no hope without God in the world.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.640]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.640]   of Christ."
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.480]   Their memory of their regretful condition was commanded.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.960]   Remember.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:53.160]   Third, surely the reason for this, this memory, is that it deepens and intensifies our thankfulness
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.540]   for grace.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:02.240]   And lastly, the reason for this remembering of sins in our lives, Paul never forgot his
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.360]   regretful past.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.520]   Writing near the end of his life, he said, "The saying is trustworthy and deserving
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.280]   of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.920]   am foremost."
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.360]   That was a regret, and he never forgot it.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   So I conclude it is good, it's good to remember our sins and feel regret.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.680]   And I said, "Up to a point."
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.160]   So my last consideration is, "What point?"
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.360]   So this is my fourth consideration.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   The time for forgetting.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   What is it?
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.280]   Philippians chapter 3, verse 13, Paul said this, "Brothers, I do not consider that
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.560]   I have made it my own."
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.160]   That is, I haven't become perfect.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   I haven't arrived yet.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.480]   "One thing I do, forgetting."
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   Here's the key word.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.440]   Oh, Marvin, let's get this.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.720]   "Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward what lies ahead, I press on toward
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.220]   the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.120]   So in Ephesians 2, Paul says, "Remember."
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.120]   And in Philippians 3, he says, "Forget."
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.200]   And if you say, "Well, when do you do which?"
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:26.120]   Here's my sense of what he means for us old men.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:37.640]   Wherever remembering our failures will help us fly to Christ, love Christ, rest in Christ,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:47.720]   cherish grace, sing of mercy, serve with zeal, then let's get on with remembering and regretting.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:56.280]   But wherever remembering begins to paralyze us with the weight of failure and remorse
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.680]   so that we don't love Christ more or cherish grace more or serve with greater energy, then
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:14.240]   let us forget and press on by the power of grace for the little time we have left.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.640]   That's the main word.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:22.920]   Press on in faith for the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.920]   Magnificent.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.320]   That's super helpful.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.440]   That was, I think, useful for a range of ages.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   All of us have regrets.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.800]   And Marvin, thank you for the question.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Thank you for listening along.

[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.400]   We are going to celebrate Thanksgiving here in the States on Thursday.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.280]   So how do we feast to the glory of God?
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.640]   And what does it mean to glorify God through the goodness of creation?
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.560]   Pastor John will lead us through 1 Timothy chapter 4 verses 1 to 5 next time.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   Bye.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   Bye.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   Bye.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   Bye.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   Bye.
