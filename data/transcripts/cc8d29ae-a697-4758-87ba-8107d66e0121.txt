[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.600]   in the right direction.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.900]   For this episode, I want to address the sufficiency and clarity of scripture along with how it
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.940]   relates to historical theology.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:05.260]   The sufficiency and clarity of scripture and historical theology may carry a level of pretentiousness
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.440]   with it that may come off intimidating.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.820]   Let me tell you from the beginning that you have nothing to be intimidated over.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.100]   Of course, I'm not covering these topics exhaustively, but I'll be giving you what I think are some
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.680]   of the relevant cookies.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.780]   The sufficiency of scripture could be defined as the following, and I'll be quoting Professor
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:38.380]   Matthew Barrett on this, "Scripture is sufficient in that it is the only inspired, inerrant,
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.540]   and therefore final authority for Christians for faith and godliness, with all other authorities
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.500]   being subservient to scripture."
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.880]   When you hear that definition on paper, for many of us listening, it might seem like a
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.500]   no-duh.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.060]   But it's one thing to understand it on paper, quite another to make sure that we've all
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500]   applied it.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.100]   To illustrate the difference by giving an example of how we've moved on from this definition,
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.980]   I've invited Professor Vodie Baucom to give us an illustration.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.820]   Okay, just kidding, he's not coming on my podcast, but you are going to hear about a
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.020]   six-minute snippet from a lecture he gave about racial reconciliation.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.140]   And if you haven't listened to it already, I highly encourage you to go listen to the
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.660]   entire lecture.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.340]   Take a listen as to why we need to recapture the doctrine of the sufficiency of scripture.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.860]   All right, Ephesians chapter two, as I was saying, we're going to look at the red-headed
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.260]   stepchild of Ephesians, and that's Ephesians chapter two, verses 11 and following.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.900]   Most people, we all love Ephesians, amen, and we all love Ephesians chapter two up to
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.460]   verse 10, right?
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.420]   You say Ephesians chapter two, everybody starts quoting, if we just started quoting
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.060]   and just reciting it from memory, we'd be good, all the way up to about verse 10.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.540]   And then people are like, "Wait, there's more?"
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.580]   And the answer is absolutely, there's more in Ephesians chapter two.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.860]   It's all good, amen?
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.140]   Ephesians chapter two is just good, but I mean, in verse 11, it just gets gooder.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.580]   And that's not even a word, you know?
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.540]   And so we are going to look at that part of the chapter.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.580]   But as we do, here's what I want us to understand.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:08.740]   That in the midst of all of this, in the midst of these discussions about social justice
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:20.400]   and race and sex and all these other things, at the end of the day, the question is, what
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.660]   does God say about us?
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.340]   What does God say about us?
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.320]   And is what God says about us sufficient?
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:46.100]   And when we start talking about who we are in Christ, when we start talking about our
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.400]   unity in Christ, our brotherhood and our relationships, do we believe that the Bible is sufficient
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.220]   in that regard?
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:06.820]   And one of the scariest things about all of this talk is that we're beginning to see a
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   new hermeneutic develop.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:26.440]   Where now sin is institutional as opposed to being in the heart of man.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.240]   We're reading things differently here.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.700]   And not only that, but we're starting to develop a new canon.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:46.000]   To where if you're not seeing things rightly on these issues, people are not saying, you
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.960]   need to go to this text.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.360]   They're saying, you need to read Divided by Faith.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.000]   You need to read Ta-Nehisi Coates.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.420]   You need to read, right?
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:06.280]   If you're not getting this, then here's a list of books that you need to read in order
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   to then be able to read the scriptures rightly as it relates to our unity with one another
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.720]   in Christ.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.440]   That is a problem.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.740]   Because I believe that the Bible is absolutely sufficient, not just inerrant, but absolutely
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.180]   sufficient for all matters of faith and practice.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.120]   And how we deal with one another across ethnicities is a matter of faith and practice.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.460]   The Bible is sufficient for that.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:53.120]   Again, I am not arguing that we shouldn't read other things.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:05.520]   I quoted other things over the course of this weekend, but the Bible is sufficient.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.040]   Let me put an even finer point on it.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:21.300]   I worry when we begin to hear people say things that would suggest that I've had the Bible
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.220]   all this time.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:33.620]   And I've had relationships with brethren of different ethnicities all this time.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:47.520]   But it wasn't until I read this book that I finally understood God's heart on this issue
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:58.220]   of justice as it relates to race and ethnicity.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:08.620]   That no, no, and it's not even it's when I finally read this book and this book was an
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:19.080]   exposition of the, no, when I read this sociology book.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:33.860]   And so now we've got sociology overriding and governing our theology.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.580]   That's not okay.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.340]   That is hugely problematic.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.940]   Isn't what you heard from Professor Votie Bauckham emblematic of what's going on today?
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.340]   The heavy push to read certain books.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.100]   And if you don't, you're a racist was very real, wasn't it?
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.500]   And if you yourself personally haven't fallen deep into that hole, let me ask you during
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.660]   this confusion, was your first instinct to go to blogs, podcasts, people, or the actual
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.420]   word of God?
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.180]   Did you have faith that the word spoke to what's been going on?
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.060]   Or did you think to yourself, maybe we need to look elsewhere for guidance on what's going
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.420]   on, even if it was ever so subtle.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:26.460]   Let me read to you just a handful of verses about the doctrine of the sufficiency of scripture.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.420]   Second Peter one three says this, his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.580]   to life and godliness through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.580]   excellence.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   It doesn't say his divine power gave us some things, and we have to look elsewhere for
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:43.580]   other things.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.820]   It says that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.800]   godliness through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.300]   Second Peter one 21 says this, for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.060]   men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.940]   Hebrews 4 12 says this, for the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.980]   sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.420]   the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:24.420]   Second Timothy three 16 and 17 says this, all scripture is breathed out by God and profitable
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.940]   for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:36.460]   man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.980]   To further expand upon this, let me quote from Mayhew and MacArthur from Biblical Doctrine.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:48.620]   This is going to be a little bit of a longer quote, but I want to fully flesh out at least
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.780]   just a little more what sufficiency actually means.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:11:01.820]   With respect to sufficiency, Mayhew and MacArthur state, "The Bible also attests to its sufficiency
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.600]   (Psalm 19 7-11).
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.140]   It is a light to one's path (Psalm 119 105).
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:15.200]   It is more reliable than even the most amazing spiritual experiences (2 Peter 1 19-20).
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.700]   It is able to lead a person to saving faith (2 Timothy 3 15).
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.900]   It instructs the religious elite as well as the common believer (Deuteronomy 6.4; Mark
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.200]   12.37; Philippians 1.1).
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.500]   It was given by God to parents to instruct their children (Deuteronomy 6.6-7).
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.060]   And it is able to even bring a child to saving faith (2 Timothy 3 14-15).
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:43.740]   Paul wrote that all scripture is given by inspiration and that it is useful for teaching,
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:49.700]   proof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3 16-17).
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:56.220]   A closer look at each of these four features reveals the full sufficiency of scripture
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.860]   to equip a believer in living out the Christian life.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:05.700]   The first term, teaching, means that the Bible instructs the believer in how to live, in
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.340]   what to believe, and in what God expects of him or her.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.260]   It is related to content and doctrine.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:17.220]   This concept fits with Jesus' injunction in the Great Commission that new disciples
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.260]   be taught to observe all he commanded (Matthew 28 18-20).
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.820]   The scriptures instruct God's people in how to live in obedience to him.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.120]   The second term, reproof, shows the scripture's purpose of admonishment.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.620]   It has to do with pointing out where a person has erred or departed from what God requires.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.660]   Scripture is able to judge the heart when a believer has deviated in doctrine or practice
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.220]   from the faith once for all delivered to the saints (Hebrews 4.12).
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.100]   The next term, correction, is the companion to reproof.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.940]   The Bible not only shows a person where he is wrong, it also identifies the corrected
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:02.100]   attitude, belief, or behavior that he should put on its place (Ephesians 4 20-24).
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.380]   Finally, training in righteousness indicates that the Bible shows how to put its teachings
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:14.340]   into practice on a daily basis with illustrations and examples (Ephesians 4 25-32).
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.540]   Between the scriptures and the indwelling Holy Spirit, the believer needs no additional
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:24.340]   revelation to be informed on how to live the Christian life.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.080]   Pastors and teachers (Ephesians 4 11-12) are supplied to assist in the process of spiritual
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:38.660]   growth unto maturity, but even their ministries are founded on and informed by the all-sufficient
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:48.980]   Word of God (2 Peter 1 2-3; 1 Peter 5 2-3).
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:55.380]   Let me also quote from the great Dutch theologian, Herman Bovink, and you're going to be hearing
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:01.360]   a lot of quotes this episode, so get ready, but I'm going to be quoting the great Dutch
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.180]   theologian Herman Bovink at length.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:15.580]   Herman Bovink stated it like this with respect to sufficiency, "This attribute of Holy
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.700]   Scripture also must be correctly understood.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:24.580]   It does not mean that all that has been said or written by the prophets, by Christ, and
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.440]   by the apostles is included in the Scripture.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.180]   Many prophetic and apostolic writings have been lost (Numbers 21-14; Joshua 10-13; 1
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:43.060]   Kings 4-33; 1 Chronicles 29-29; 2 Chronicles 9-29; 12-15; 1 Corinthians 5-9; Colossians
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.160]   4-16; Philippians 3-1).
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.340]   And Jesus, as well as the apostles, have spoken many more words and performed many more signs
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:15:03.700]   than are recorded (John 20-30; 1 Corinthians 11-2; 2 Thessalonians 2-5; 2 John 12; 3 John
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.180]   14).
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.900]   Nor does this attribute imply that Scripture contains all the practices, ceremonies, rules,
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.500]   and regulations that the Church needs for its organization, but only that it completely
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:25.380]   contains the Articles of Faith (Articulae Fide), the matters necessary to salvation.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.860]   Neither does this attribute of Scripture mean that these Articles of Faith are literally,
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.700]   and in so many words, contained in it.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:39.580]   Rather, it only claims that either explicitly or implicitly, they are so included that they
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:49.180]   can be derived from it solely by comparative study and reflection without the help of another
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.820]   source.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:16:00.540]   A contemporary example of what Bovink is stating in this latter portion would be church membership.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.620]   Nor in the Bible does it say that a church must practice membership.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:10.820]   However, when you look at the reasons undergirding the practice of church membership in a post-modern
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:17.740]   "truth is relative, non-lordship of Christ" type of landscape, when you take the formula
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.860]   of adequately discerning biblical truth coupled with correctly interpreting the times, which
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:30.140]   is what Jesus rebuked many over, one could see why a church would deem the practice of
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.500]   church membership necessary.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.100]   Let me quote that last part again just so we're clear.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:43.100]   Bovink says, "Nor does this attribute imply that Scripture contains all the practices,
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:48.740]   ceremonies, rules, and regulations that the church needs for its organization, but only
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:54.640]   that it completely contains the Articles of Faith (Articulae Fide), the matters necessary
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.980]   to salvation.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.260]   Neither does this attribute of Scripture mean that these Articles of Faith are literally,
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.100]   and in so many words, contained in it.
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:09.620]   Rather, it only claims that, either explicitly or implicitly, they are so included that they
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:17.120]   can be derived from it solely by comparative study and reflection, without the help of
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.780]   another source."
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:37.460]   Bovink goes on to state a little bit after this, "In other words, the question is whether
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:44.300]   the written Word of God explicitly or implicitly contains everything we need to know for our
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:55.120]   salvation and therefore is the total and sufficient rule of faith and morals, or whether, in addition,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:18:04.980]   we must assume the existence of still another principle of knowledge" (Principiam Cognoscenti).
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.840]   Bovink answers this question by stating the following a little afterwards, "At no time
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:16.640]   is the Church in the Old Testament and the New Testament ever directed to anything other
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.940]   than the always-available Word of God, either written or unwritten.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.020]   By it alone, human beings can have a spiritual life.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.980]   The Church finds all it needs in the Scripture available to it at a given time.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:40.260]   Subsequent Scriptures presuppose, link up with, and build upon preceding Scripture.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.380]   The prophets and psalmists assume the Torah.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.500]   Isaiah 820 calls everyone to the law and to the testimony.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:55.660]   The New Testament considers itself the fulfillment of the Old Testament and refers back to nothing
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.340]   other than the existing Scripture.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.780]   Even more telling is the fact that all that lies outside of Scripture is as firmly as
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.020]   possible ruled out.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:17.220]   Christians are rejected as the institutions of human beings" (Isaiah 29.13; 1 Corinthians
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   4.6).
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.140]   The tradition that developed in the days of the Old Testament prompted the Jews to reject
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.340]   the Christ.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:33.740]   Over against it, Jesus posited His "But I say to you" (Matthew 5.27; 5.32; 5.34; 5.38;
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.740]   5.44).
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:40.300]   And against Pharisees and scribes, He again aligned Himself with the law and the prophets.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:46.260]   The apostles appeal only to the Old Testament Scriptures and never refer the churches to
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.020]   anything other than the Word of God proclaimed by them.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.840]   Inasmuch as in the early period, tradition sought to be nothing other than the preservation
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:03.660]   of the things personally taught and instituted by the apostles, it was not yet "dangerous."
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.660]   If you pull all of this together, it's exactly as Professor Matthew Barrett stated in the
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.540]   beginning.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:19.400]   Scripture is sufficient in that it is the only inspired, inerrant, and therefore final
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:28.260]   authority for Christians for faith and godliness with all other authorities being subservient
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.760]   to Scriptures.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:36.260]   So if the Scriptures are sufficient for all things pertaining to life, and to interpret
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:43.340]   and defend against every new intellectual fad that sweeps even nations, the next thing
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:51.220]   we need to be convicted about is that you yourself could dig into it and understand
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.300]   it.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:21:01.740]   You yourself have the tools and the capacity to understand what is truth, beauty, goodness,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.600]   right and wrong, reality and illusion, justice and injustice.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.720]   This doctrine doesn't mean that some portions of Scripture are not more difficult to understand
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.840]   than others, or that it's not going to take any work to understand the Scriptures, or
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.640]   that it doesn't take any prayer to understand the Scriptures, or that at times other human
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.400]   beings could aid you in understanding the Scriptures because they're difficult.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.840]   After all, Apostle Peter states in 2 Peter 3.16, in reference to the Scriptures, he says
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.960]   this, "As also in all his letters," referring to Paul's letters, "As also in all his letters,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:43.120]   speaking in them of these things, in which there are some things that are hard to understand,"
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:50.360]   referring to the Scriptures, "which they untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.140]   rest of the Scriptures to their own destruction."
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:06.160]   So, concerning the clarity of Scripture, concerning the clarity of Scripture, let me quote Professor
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:13.200]   Mark Thompson here because he provides helpful insight here to further flesh out the doctrine
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.760]   of the clarity of Scripture.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.920]   Professor Mark Thompson says this, "The doctrine of the clarity of Scripture is not simply
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.740]   a deduction from the character of God and His purpose.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.200]   It is the teaching of Scripture itself.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.360]   In fact, it is a basic presupposition of Jesus' ministry.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.280]   His appeal, 'It is written,' would make little sense if what is written was inaccessible.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.840]   Jesus' appeal assumes that what is written can be understood.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.380]   So to his regular question, 'Have you not read?'"
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:52.080]   which is in Matthew 12, Matthew 12.5, Matthew 19.4, Matthew 22.3, "It was not because the
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.280]   words were obscure that the Pharisees failed to obey, and the Sadducees were without hope.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   Jesus' assumption is that they ought to have read, ought to have understood, and ought
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.840]   therefore to have acted differently.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.780]   The use that a written word is to be put assumes its meaning is accessible.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.920]   How else could it be a source of encouragement and hope," Romans 15.4, "How else could the
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.260]   sacred writings make one wise for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ?
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.760]   Or Scripture be profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness?
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.700]   In an important parable told to teach, among other things, the necessity of responding
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.160]   to the word that has already been given, Jesus concluded, 'If they do not hear Moses and
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.760]   the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead'" Luke
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.440]   16.31.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:50.200]   Paul would later encourage the Corinthians to learn not to go beyond what is written,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.120]   1 Corinthians 4.6.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.680]   From Joshua, Joshua 1.8 to Timothy, 1 Timothy 4.13, encouragement is given to read and study
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.920]   the Scriptures both in private and public.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.320]   The Apostle Paul reasoned from the Scriptures as a critical, central part of his ministry,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.000]   Acts 17.2-3.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.720]   The Beroean Christians would examine the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so, Acts
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   17.11.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.100]   Jesus' ministry, his death, resurrection, and ascension were to be understood in light
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.480]   of the words of the Law and Prophets, and this great intervention by God provided the
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.520]   goal to which the testimony of the Old Testament had been pointing all along.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.740]   John 5.39-24.44 The pattern of Jesus' ministry, the mission
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.300]   of the Apostles, and the life of the early church was a confident approach to the Scriptures
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.440]   expecting that they can and should be understood by those who read them.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:53.940]   It has long been a feature of Christian discipleship that regular, deep engagement with the written
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:59.660]   word of God nourishes faith and shapes lives.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.220]   The Anglican Reformer Thomas Cranmer put it, "This word, whosoever
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:08.500]   is diligent to read and in his heart to print that which he readeth, the great affection
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.980]   to the transitory things of this world shall be minished in him, and the great desire of
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:19.380]   heavenly things that be there and promised of God shall increase in him."
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.660]   From a fruitful exhortation to the reading and knowledge of Holy Scripture.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:31.600]   That great work of transformed desire could hardly be done without understanding what
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.180]   is written.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:43.260]   The Apostle Paul could ask on more than one occasion, "What does the Scripture say?"
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:49.420]   Romans 4.3, Galatians 4.30.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.300]   So if the Scriptures are sufficient, which they are, and if the Scriptures are clear
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.820]   to the believer, which they are, how does this relate to historical theology?
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:07.740]   Keep in mind that as I'm answering this question, do not forget that history, theology, and
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.340]   therefore historical theology are fallible.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.340]   We are fallible.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.620]   The Scriptures are not.
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:21.220]   However, one of the many benefits we receive from studying historical theology is that
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.620]   we witness the absolute timelessness of the Word of God.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.740]   We see the sufficiency and the clarity through this community of consciousness that we are
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:38.820]   linked through with the past saints who have also relied on the Word to get them through
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.940]   the storms of their own era.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.580]   Because every era has their own storm.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:53.260]   If history is indeed cyclical, which it is, then what we'll see is how past generations
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.060]   understood the Word.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:59.700]   How did they understand the doctrine of the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture and how
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.580]   did they apply it?
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.580]   Using the Scriptures themselves, we could build upon the wisdom that was given to past
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:12.260]   generations, gain their insight, which is a healthy tradition when done in light of
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.260]   the Scriptures.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.060]   Let me be clear.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.180]   Past generations are fallible.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.660]   Past generations are fallible.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:30.980]   I could show you example after example of how even the greatest theologians were clearly
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:37.580]   wrong and even some early church fathers were wrong, Eusebius in particular, who prescribed
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:43.520]   this unhealthy delineation between the sacred and the secular.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.660]   So Scripture alone is the authority.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:54.780]   It does not mean historical theology is useless.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.820]   I'm going to quote Hermann Bavink again because I think he is very helpful here.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:05.660]   Speaking on the distinction of tradition between Rome and the Reformation, he stated
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:13.700]   it like this, "To the mind of the Reformation, Scripture was an organic principle from which
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   the entire tradition, living on in preaching, confession, liturgy, worship, theology, devotional
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.580]   literature, etc., arises and is nurtured.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:31.440]   It is a pure spring of living water from which all the currents and channels of the religious
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.380]   life are fed and maintained.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.620]   Such a tradition is grounded in Scripture itself.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.500]   After Jesus completed His work, He sent forth the Holy Spirit who, while adding nothing
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.100]   new to the Revelation, still guides the church into the truth (John 16, 12-15) until it passes
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:54.420]   through all its diversity and arrives at the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.020]   of God (Ephesians 3.18; 3.19; 4.13).
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:03.900]   In this sense, there is a good, true, and glorious tradition.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.500]   It is the method by which the Holy Spirit causes the truth of Scripture to pass into
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:16.660]   the consciousness and life of the church."
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:24.380]   R. Scott Clark
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:30.300]   The fundamental job of the historical theologian is to help the church and other interested
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:37.540]   parties to remember the theology, piety, and practice of the past, and thus to provide
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:44.660]   a context for contemporary theological reflections, doxology, and praxis.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:50.900]   In our late modern period, we are particularly tempted to amnesia and in greater need of
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.540]   older readings of Scripture, theological reflection, and pastoral wisdom than ever before.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.020]   Thus, we need historical theology more than ever before.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:06.540]   Though historical theology is vitally interested in the history and development of doctrine,
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.300]   in the history of Christian experience, and practice of the faith, it is not the historian's
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:19.020]   job to "prescribe" what should be believed theologically or done practically today.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:29.240]   If it is to be of use, historical theology must be "descriptive" rather than "prescriptive."
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:37.220]   As new waves of doctrine come in, as the ones who probably should lead are discouraged and
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:44.340]   scared and just plain wrong, sometimes we need to look to the generations of the past
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.580]   to see how they dealt with similar issues.
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:53.300]   Because you see, when these new waves of doctrine hit us, one of the most discouraging places
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:31:02.100]   to be is to feel as if this new wind of doctrine is completely novel.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.460]   As if it's never been dealt with in the history of the world, in the history of mankind.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.460]   As if the scriptures are incapable of dealing with it.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.340]   But when you look back upon history and understand the scope of history and how the Word has
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.300]   responded in generations past, not man's writings or man's wisdom, but the Word of
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.760]   God has responded in generations past.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:31.020]   As you begin to see and become convinced yourself, individually, of its timelessness, there's
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:38.820]   a sense of conviction that begins to grow about the Word of God itself.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.660]   You begin to feel a kinship with the Christians of the past.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:50.780]   The world and Satan tend to hit in areas that their particular generation is weak in.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.840]   And we heard and saw it loud and clear with the current crop of controversial issues.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.100]   It was as if nobody could define justice.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.460]   Nobody understood social justice.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.620]   Nobody had a biblical and truthful understanding of race, compassion, and work.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:11.140]   And moreover, we continue to hold on to this foolish belief that there is a real dichotomy
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.460]   of the sacred and the secular for the Christian.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:26.020]   But we are put at ease when we realize that the scriptures absolutely have spoken.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:32.700]   We are even more comforted when we see that these issues, at least in the scope of history,
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.460]   are not novel.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.940]   They are actually just old tricks repackaged with a different costume.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.900]   Let me say that again.
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:48.980]   These new wind of doctrines, when you study historical theology, you see they are actually
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:55.600]   just old tricks repackaged with a different costume.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:05.260]   When we realize this, and we become armed, conviction is much more easily born.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.620]   I can't go into it in this episode.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:12.580]   I'll try to devote a future episode on this topic.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:18.140]   Believe me when I tell you there's a whole lot we could learn from the likes of John
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.820]   Calvin, Abraham Kuyper, Herman Boving.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:27.140]   To be more specific, feel free to investigate what happened to the surrounding communities
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:35.740]   of those I just mentioned to you who advocated a right view of scriptural holistic thinking
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.100]   and living.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:44.940]   Check out John Calvin's Geneva, Kuyper and Boving's Netherlands, and then compare that
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.460]   with the late apologist, Francis Schaeffer, the late American apologist, Francis Schaeffer,
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:57.900]   who tried to warn us of the coming threat to his last dying breath.
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.960]   Francis Schaeffer wrote a book called How Should We Now Live?
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:13.880]   If you do a quick search engine, put his name in, and then if you type in a Christian manifesto,
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.740]   he has some remarkable insight.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:22.460]   That is a lecture he gave in 1982.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.780]   One word of caution with respect to historical theology.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.100]   One word of caution here.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:36.340]   Before you engage and do a deep dive into historical theology, let me make something
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.420]   clear.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:46.660]   Please, please know the entire scope of the scriptures first.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.460]   If you don't, all you'll be doing is merely adopting the viewpoints of the first person
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.580]   you read.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.300]   Please do not throw man's words above the actual words of God.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:06.620]   I'm not saying that you have to do this incredibly detailed verse-by-verse study of the entire
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.420]   Bible before you crack open any theological book.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:20.220]   That's not what I'm saying, but try to know the entire scope of the scriptures first.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:34.400]   Or else, would you not just ingest the previous generation's errors along with the truth?
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   That is something that I think we should all watch out for.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:50.300]   Because even in our pursuit to seek after God's word, we can sometimes let man's opinion
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:57.460]   and their reflections about God's word be above God's word itself.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.480]   And that would totally be a tragedy.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.400]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.080]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:26.200]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:40.840]   Amen.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.320]   Amen.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.900]   (upbeat music)
