[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   On this podcast, we talk a lot about joy and of course, that means that we field a lot
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.720]   of necessary questions about joylessness.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.160]   We've also talked in the past about how husbands take the leading role in seeking to grow the
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.000]   joy of their own homes.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.600]   I'm thinking back to APJ 255, I believe it is.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.640]   Dad's role in homemaking, one of my favorites in the history of this podcast, APJ 255, dad's
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.320]   role in homemaking.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.840]   But what about when this task seems especially impossible?
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.160]   It's a question from an anonymous man who writes this.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.080]   I praise God for your ministry.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.480]   Thank you for staying in the course and serving the church so well for so long.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.160]   I would love your advice for my marriage.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.780]   My wife and I have been married for nearly 18 years and have three young children.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.760]   By her own admission, my wife is an Eeyore type personality.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.560]   There are seasons where her gloominess and maybe borderline depression persists and has
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   a significant impact on the joy in our home.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.720]   I feel helpless to help.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.880]   When I try to address the issue with her, she ends up feeling like a failure and sinks
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.120]   even lower.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.200]   What can I do to help her, Pastor John?
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.060]   I'm committed to our marriage covenant and desire that she and our family flourish."
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.940]   As I thought and prayed over this situation, and I know several marriages like this, long
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.140]   marriages like this, marriages where there's been hospitalization over and over again for
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.100]   a depressed spouse.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.260]   I thought of 10 words of counsel that I would share to this anonymous husband.
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.860]   And some of them are very short and others are a little longer, so let me just go through
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.460]   them quickly.
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.780]   One, join me, brother, in thanking God for giving you the grace for 18 years of faithfulness.
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.420]   It is a beautiful Christ-honoring thing.
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.020]   That's my first word of counsel.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.620]   God is amazing that He has brought you this far and that you care for her and want to
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.900]   be a blessing to her.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.100]   Number two, put out of your mind every thought that you may be married to the wrong person.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.860]   The best way to know whether you are married to the right person is to look at the name
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.380]   on your wedding certificate.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.540]   If it's her name, that's God's will for your life.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.740]   Number three, recognize that some Christians will never in this life grow beyond certain
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.740]   limitations.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.780]   I don't say this because God can't do it and indeed might do it, but because 1 Thessalonians
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:59.460]   5.14 says, "Admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.460]   them all."
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.140]   Paul seems to say that there will always be this kind of diversity of weakness among
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.540]   believers—not that there should be, but that there will be.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.900]   God assigns faith and growth according to His own inscrutable wisdom.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.340]   Paul says that in Romans 12.3.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:28.380]   In other words, it may be God's plan for you to shepherd your wife not out of her depression,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.860]   but with her depression to the end.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.900]   Number four, there's a principle of patience under God's sovereignty in 2 Timothy 2.24.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.480]   The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.260]   enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.220]   God may perhaps grant them repentance.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:04.100]   In other words, even though that's not talking about marriage and depression, there's a principle
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100]   here.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.100]   Isn't there?
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:15.020]   Kindness, patience, gentleness, willingness to endure sorrow might bring about change.
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.900]   Whether it does or not, it's our calling to be that way.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.980]   Number five, our calling as husbands is clear from Colossians and Ephesians.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.060]   Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.740]   It's Colossians 3.19.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.300]   Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300]   Ephesians 5.25.
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.580]   This is our calling, no matter how little effect it has on our wives.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.580]   Let this sink in.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:00.500]   Christ is married to a wife, the church, including us husbands, that falls far more short of
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.020]   the command to love him with all our hearts, far more short than our wives fall short of
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.700]   any expectations we have.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:20.460]   In other words, we fall more short of what Christ deserves from us than our wives fall
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.220]   short of what we deserve or hope for.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.440]   No husband is promised a cheerful wife.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:36.420]   It's not in the Bible, no matter how prayerful he chooses at the front end of that relationship.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:45.420]   Number six, stay with her as a patient, gentle leader in the disciplines of grace, no matter
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.220]   how seemingly dull her emotional response may be.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:59.420]   That is, read the scriptures with her, speak promises from God to her every day, not criticisms,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:06.940]   but promises, pray for her gently and out loud for her joy and strength, but not in
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.700]   a teachy way or a condescending way.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.500]   Don't use prayer as an indirect way to chastise her or teach her.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.380]   Take her to church and sit with her in worship.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:28.060]   Point her to passages of scripture that show that the saints go through darkness like Micah
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.340]   7, 8, "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.900]   When I fall, I shall rise.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.060]   When I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light to me."
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:45.060]   You have no idea what the long-term effects of steady-state spiritual disciplines of grace
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.380]   may accomplish.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.380]   Number seven, do not fail to feed your own soul with the Word of God.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.580]   Do it alone and do it with a band of brothers, not a big one.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.740]   A few trusted friends who can pray for you and hear your sorrows and bear your burdens
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.220]   and exhort you to stay the course with joy.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:14.140]   Number eight, if it seems appropriate and if she's willing, encourage her to seek help
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:20.620]   from a wise, Bible-saturated, prayerful Christian counselor.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:28.340]   He or she may be able to discern obstacles to her joy that you might have missed and
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.380]   she might have missed.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.460]   Number nine, learn from scripture and from the stories of difficult marriages that the
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.100]   Lord has reasons for your trials.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.820]   Take for example the marriage of Abraham and Mary Lincoln.
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.980]   It was not a happy marriage.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.380]   He brought many flaws.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.660]   We could talk about those in another APJ, but let me just focus for a moment on the
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.940]   question at hand.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:04.260]   God's purpose for Abraham Lincoln in a very difficult marriage with a woman who, according
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:10.260]   to Mark Knoll—so these are now quotes from an article by historian Mark Knoll—Mary
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.660]   often flew into rages.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.100]   She pushed Lincoln relentlessly to seek high public office, and she complained endlessly
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.620]   about poverty.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:25.100]   She overran her budget shamelessly, both in Springfield and in the White House.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.680]   She abused servants as if they were slaves and ragged on Lincoln when he tried to pay
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.480]   them extra.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:39.220]   She assaulted him on more than one occasion with firewood, with potatoes.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.820]   She once probably chased him with a knife through their backyard in Springfield, and
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:52.840]   she treated his casual contacts with attractive females as a direct threat while herself flirting
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.460]   constantly and dressing to kill."
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.540]   But the two stayed married.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.900]   What was the gain?
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.380]   Knoll asks this question.
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.140]   What was the gain?
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.680]   And he gives two historical suggestions.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.620]   How was it, he says, that Lincoln, when president, could work so effectively with the rampant
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.360]   egos who filled his administration?
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:26.580]   The long years of dealing with his tempestuous wife helped him prepare for handling the difficult
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.940]   people he encountered as president.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.740]   In other words, a whole nation benefited from his embracing this pain.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:43.740]   And second, over the slow fires of misery that he learned to keep banked and under heavy
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:50.740]   pressure deep within him, his innate qualities of patience, tolerance, forbearance, and forgiveness
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.900]   were tempered and refined.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:02.780]   In other words, embrace what God has given you and be made strong in the slow heat of
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.620]   the refining fire.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:12.500]   Finally, number 10, picture the thankfulness of your wife in the resurrection.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:20.300]   When she has been set free and thinks back over the remarkable patience and kindness
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.540]   that you showed her for decades.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:34.500]   Right now, she does not even have the emotional wherewithal to respond to you as she should
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.140]   and as you desire that she would.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:45.580]   But one day in the resurrection, she will have that capacity and her memory of your
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.780]   patience will be part of your joy.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:54.460]   Thank you for putting this entire situational challenge within an eternal perspective, Pastor
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.460]   John.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.460]   Thank you.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.940]   And at the top of today's episode, I mentioned one of my favorite episodes of all time, APJ255,
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.380]   Dad's Role in Homemaking.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.540]   You can find it online.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:09.620]   That's APJ255, Dad's Role in Homemaking.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.820]   Whether you listen in the car, at the gym, doing chores, thank you for inviting us into
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.220]   your busy day.

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:33.460]   You can do that by going online to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.980]   Well just about every Christian wants to be used by God to transform the lives of others.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.340]   But what is the cost of ministry?
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.180]   What's the key to effective ministry?
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.580]   That question is up next.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.220]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.100]   We'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:57.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.480]   you
