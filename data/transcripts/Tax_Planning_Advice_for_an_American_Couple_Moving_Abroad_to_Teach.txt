[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.600]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   I am your host.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.620]   Today on the show, I'm going to talk to you about the tax obligations for Americans
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.620]   moving abroad.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.520]   Yesterday on the show, I apologize, I wasn't super happy with it, but anyway, it's out.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.680]   But yesterday on the show, I talked about changing taxes by moving abroad and how effective
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.160]   that can be, and I received a very thoughtful and well-written question from one of my patrons
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.700]   in planning for a Friday Q&A show, and I thought that I would just go ahead and do a standalone
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.920]   answer to it.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.120]   And so if you are an American who would like to understand the tax obligations that you
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.400]   would have to the United States and also to your prospective new country of residence,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.520]   then this is the show for you.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.960]   I'll explain it to you.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.320]   Jeremy writes in and says, "Hi, Joshua.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320]   My name is Jeremy.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.880]   I've been listening to Radical Personal Finance for several years.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.760]   I appreciate the wealth of quality content you have produced, and I'm happy to support
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760]   the show on Patreon."
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760]   Thank you, Jeremy.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120]   "I wanted to reach out, as a supporter of the show, I wanted to reach out with a question
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.840]   regarding the taxation of American expats," meaning expatriates, "living abroad.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.300]   I'm not sure if you accept questions this way, but I wanted to try.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.800]   My wife and I are both American citizens considering moving abroad.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.880]   I am a public school teacher, and she is self-employed and works from home.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.440]   She owns a single-member LLC digital marketing business.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.260]   If we moved, I would take a job teaching at an international school, and she would continue
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.600]   to run her business remotely.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.900]   However, before moving, we want to get a complete and accurate picture of what our tax liabilities
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.260]   will be.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.000]   This is the scenario we expect.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.300]   I will be teaching at an international school, and the school will withhold income taxes
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.280]   to the local government for me.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.300]   I will make under $106,000.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.220]   My wife will be self-employed.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.760]   Her business is registered in Ohio, all of her clients will be in the United States,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.000]   and all income will be deposited into U.S. bank accounts.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.320]   She will also make under $106,000.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.820]   Based on my understanding of the foreign earned income exclusion, all U.S. citizens that qualify
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.060]   can exclude up to $105,900 of foreign income for 2019 from their taxes.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.320]   Once I begin teaching abroad, I expect that I will pay income tax to that country's
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.520]   government, but will not owe federal income tax to the United States because of the foreign
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.360]   earned income exclusion.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.460]   No social security or medicare tax because I have a foreign employer, and no state income
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.800]   tax as long as I can prove my permanent residence abroad.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.880]   However, my wife's situation is less clear.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.740]   Though she will be living abroad, and doing all of her work abroad, her business will
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.640]   be registered in the United States, and all her clients will be in the United States.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   Consequently, my questions are, 1.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.800]   Are my assumptions about my tax liability as a teacher abroad correct?
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   2.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.960]   Is my wife eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   3.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.800]   Will my wife owe social security and medicare taxes on her business income?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   4.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.120]   Will my wife owe taxes to the state of Ohio on her business income?
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120]   5.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.520]   Does my wife owe any taxes to the country where we will be living?
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   What is incredibly frustrating is that I have reached out to numerous tax professionals
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.580]   and continually get different answers.
[00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.120]   This is information we desperately need before making such a serious commitment.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.680]   Since you are also an American citizen operating a business while living abroad, I hope you
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   can provide some guidance.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.240]   If you do not know, do you happen to know anyone I could contact to get these answers?
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   Thanks for your help.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.960]   I hope you're staying sane and healthy in these crazy times.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   Best, Jeremy.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   Yes, Jeremy, I am.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.160]   Let me take care of the dogs, and then I'll answer your questions.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.760]   First, I thank you for writing such an excellent and orderly question because it will allow
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.840]   me in answering your question to lay out basically all of the components of what taxation is
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.520]   like for Americans who are living abroad.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.280]   Let's begin with the first piece of data that you shared, that my wife and I are both American
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   citizens considering moving abroad.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.160]   It is very important that Americans pay close attention to what I say, but people who are
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.840]   not Americans can basically ignore this show, with the exception of your abstract interest
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.640]   in American taxation, because the answer is extraordinarily different for Americans as
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.320]   compared to any other nationality on earth due to the unique system of citizenship-based
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.160]   taxation in the United States.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.120]   The first thing is, both you and your wife are considered to be U.S. persons for American
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.200]   taxes, and as U.S. persons, that means that the IRS considers that you owe the IRS income
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.920]   taxes on your worldwide income.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.440]   Now there are basically three categories, three broad categories of people who qualify,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.820]   who get taxed by the IRS.
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.000]   Number one is American citizens.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Any American citizen, be it intentional American citizen, be it native-born American citizen,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.720]   be it naturalized American citizen, any American citizen owes tax to the IRS on their worldwide
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.840]   income.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.960]   Number two is any holder of a U.S. permanent residency visa.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.120]   So anybody who has the ability to live and work in the United States, who's a permanent
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.880]   resident, who's a green card holder, to the extent that their green card is valid, the
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.200]   United States considers them to be a U.S. person.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   This is important.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.840]   Say, for example, you come from Mexico and you go to the United States, you get a green
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.640]   card and then you move back to Mexico.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.880]   Your tax obligations to the U.S. government do not end when you physically leave the United
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   States.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.360]   Your tax obligations only end when you surrender your green card.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.880]   The third category of person who owes taxes to the IRS is somebody who spends a substantial
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.280]   amount of time in the United States, somebody who qualifies under what's called the substantial
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.340]   presence test.
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.640]   You can look up the details of that substantial presence test, but basically if you wind up
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.240]   spending more than four months a year in the United States, you'll wind up owing the United
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.600]   States tax money based upon your substantial presence inside of the United States.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.080]   It is important to note that the IRS does not look to the immigration system as its
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.400]   definition of whether or not somebody is a resident.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:20.600]   You can fully follow all of the relevant immigration laws and find yourself being a taxpayer, owing
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.640]   taxes to the United States, or you can ignore the immigration laws and still find yourself
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   owing taxes.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   You're not connected.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.280]   So you have to, if you satisfy the substantial presence test, even if you're just a visitor
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.160]   visa, you may still wind up owing taxes to the U.S. government.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.440]   In your case, your system is simple though because both you and your wife are American
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.680]   citizens and for as long as you are American citizens, you will owe the U.S. government
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.360]   taxes on your worldwide income, anywhere it's earned in the world, subject to three basic
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   exceptions.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.160]   One, the foreign earned income exclusion, which is the bulk of our conversation here.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.800]   Number two, the foreign housing deduction or foreign housing exclusion.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   And number three, foreign tax credits.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.440]   So let's go on with the fact pattern.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.480]   I'm a public school teacher and she is self-employed and works from home.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.640]   She owns a single member LLC digital marketing business.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.800]   If we moved, I would take a job teaching at an international school and she would continue
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.400]   to run her business remotely.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.360]   So first, are my assumptions about my tax liability as a teacher abroad correct?
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   Yes.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   If you move abroad, you will have two systems of tax authorities to think about.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.880]   First is the United States.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.040]   The second is your country of residence.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.600]   With regard to the United States, the first question is, are you going to qualify for
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.800]   the foreign earned income exclusion?
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.160]   There are two ways that you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.000]   The first way is called the strict days test, where you count the number of days that you
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.820]   are physically present inside of the United States.
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:59.280]   If that number is fewer than 35 days within a rolling 12 month period, you will qualify
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.040]   for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.160]   Simple fact pattern, you leave the United States on January 1 and you do not return
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.640]   to the United States until December 31.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.260]   For the entire calendar year, you will qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:23.400]   If you leave on June 1 and return on the following June 1, you will get a 50% of the exclusion
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.840]   that can be applied to your income for the tax year, but you don't have to be gone for
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.960]   the calendar year.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.980]   That's the basic point I'm trying to make.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.440]   So that's called the strict days test that gives you up to 35 days inside the United
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   States.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.700]   And when you fill out that form, you just simply say, here's the number of days that
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.340]   I have been present inside the United States.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.500]   If it is less than 35, then you will qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:53.000]   The foreign earned income exclusion will allow you to not owe federal income tax on your
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.200]   first $106,000 of income.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.320]   That number changes each year based upon an inflation adjustment.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:05.560]   So it's usually about $106,000, but it will avoid your income tax on the first $106,000
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.360]   of your earned income.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.960]   It will not save you money on capital gains taxes.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.600]   It will not save you money on unearned income, but on your earned income, that will eliminate
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.420]   your tax liability to the United States on your first $106,000 of tax liability.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.400]   The second way that you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion is based upon what's
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.640]   called the bona fide residency test, which means do you live somewhere else?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.160]   Genuinely, legitimately, truly, are you a bona fide resident elsewhere?
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.920]   If you've moved from the United States to London and you own a house in London and you
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:44.400]   have a permanent resident visa in England and/or maybe you're a British citizen and
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.720]   all of your center of life is there and you don't really have many connections to the
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.360]   United States, there's a long series of tests basically, you could prove, "Look, I'm a bona
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.800]   fide resident of England.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.280]   I don't live in the United States anymore."
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.720]   Under that circumstance, you have a little bit more flexibility with the amount of time
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   that you spend in the United States.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.720]   In theory, you could spend up to a few months a year each year in the United States and
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.160]   still qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.520]   But then again, you still need to avoid triggering the substantial presence test.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.440]   So in that situation, your assumptions about your tax liability as a teacher are correct.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.880]   If you have moved abroad and you're teaching in an international school in a foreign country,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.000]   your wages are earned income.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.080]   And as long as you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, you will not owe
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:36.280]   the United States any taxes on that particular, on that first $106,000 of income.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.280]   Now what about your local taxation?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.840]   Because that's the other side of it.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   You will owe taxes to the place that you are a tax resident.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.480]   So this would vary depending on the specific country that you are working in.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.040]   If you moved to England or let's use the Netherlands, right?
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   You moved to the Netherlands and you're working in an international school as a teacher and
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   you're there in the Netherlands all year, then of course you'll be a tax resident of
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.880]   the Netherlands and you will owe taxes to the government of the Netherlands due to your
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.240]   working in that country.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.680]   And you will owe them both employment taxes, contributions to the social security system
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.320]   in the Netherlands, as well as income taxes to the Netherlands government.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.160]   And your tax structure with the United States does not affect that.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.400]   That's based upon your physical presence in the Netherlands.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.320]   Now if you moved to a lower tax country or no income tax country, say for example you
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.960]   moved to Dubai and you take a job at an international school in Dubai, Dubai has no income tax.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.400]   Well in that situation you would not owe any income tax to the Dubai government because
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   they don't have any income tax.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   What you would want to look up is you want to look up what is tax, what are the rules
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.440]   of tax residency for each country that you're looking at.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.840]   Each country has a different set of rules.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.920]   Some countries are very, very tight on what it means to be a tax resident and it's very
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.440]   easy to trigger it.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.480]   For example, a country like Switzerland has a very short period of time, I think it's
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   something like 90 days.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.720]   If you're in the country more than 90 days, there's a good chance that Switzerland is
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.380]   going to claim that you're a tax resident of that country.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.800]   Other countries have a much looser period of time.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.920]   Some countries may still have the old standard of if you're in the country fewer than six
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.800]   months then you don't owe any income taxes.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.960]   And so in those countries it might be possible.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.240]   Let's just pretend, what country should I use?
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.400]   I guess we could use a country like Australia.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.360]   Australia has a three-part test to qualify for whether you're a tax resident.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:40.760]   The first part is the resides test where you actually reside, where is your physical presence,
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.640]   what's your intention and purpose, where is your family located, where do you have ties,
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.840]   where are your assets, what are your living arrangements.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.200]   The second is the domicile test and then the third is 183-day test.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.260]   And so the six-month test, basically the 183-day test is the third test.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.940]   If you satisfy either of the first two then they'll qualify you as a tax resident.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.440]   But if you didn't do those things and you were in the country fewer than 183 days, then
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.900]   in theory maybe you wouldn't actually become an Australian tax resident for tax purposes.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.860]   So as an American, let's say that you went to Australia and you were going to be teaching
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.200]   at a school but you didn't actually take up residence there.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.140]   You just rented a temporary Airbnb apartment and you were only there during the time when
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.740]   school is in session, which would be less than 183 days perhaps.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.100]   And you taught and then you left.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.600]   Well, in theory something like that might qualify you as not being a tax resident if
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.420]   all of your stuff were elsewhere.
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.840]   And so you want to think about where you actually are.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.940]   Now I understand that you're probably not a weirdo.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.260]   You're going to move somewhere, live there genuinely.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.020]   But you do want to pay attention to what you're actually paying, where you actually are.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:55.120]   So your tax obligations to that foreign government are going to be exactly that way.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.220]   Now let's talk about your wife.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.520]   Is your wife eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion?
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.160]   Well the answer is if she qualifies for the results.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.460]   But there is nothing in the, if she passes the test for the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.900]   yes, she will be eligible for it.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:14.500]   There's nothing in the foreign earned income exclusion that applies to where her business
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.140]   is located or where she sells to.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.660]   It's all about where she is physically located.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.140]   Now what's probably tripping you up is when you read the foreign earned income exclusion,
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.860]   the first thing is, let's see, it's called the tax home test, right?
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.700]   Which is basically where's your tax home.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.460]   And you say, well, what does that mean?
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:34.980]   That in my understanding is just basically where do you do the work from, right?
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.140]   So my tax home is my bedroom.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.460]   That's my tax home.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.660]   It's not a matter of where my customers are.
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.520]   You're listening to me in the United States right now.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.580]   That doesn't matter for the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.020]   What matters is where am I actually working?
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.940]   And the tax home test is much more of a factor for people who are offshore workers, sometimes
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.420]   military contractors, et cetera.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.820]   But in your situation, you don't need to worry about that.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.660]   So the physical location of her business is irrelevant.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.180]   The fact that she does her business in the United States as a single member LLC doesn't
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.180]   matter.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.500]   The fact that all of her customers in the United States doesn't matter.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.840]   There's no obligation to her there.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.660]   The foreign earned income exclusion covers her based upon where she is.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.900]   So if she satisfies the tests, the tax home test, which is easy, and then either the strict
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.400]   days test or the bona fide residency test, she will qualify for the foreign earned income
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   exclusion.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.540]   And her qualification for the foreign earned income exclusion will exempt the first $106,000
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.600]   of her income from federal income taxes.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.700]   And it's 106 for you.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.220]   It's 106 for her.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.540]   So given the constraints that you laid out in your case where you said both of you will
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.820]   be earning less than $106,000, if you go abroad, you move abroad, and you're outside of the
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:51.940]   United States for at least 330 days per year, then you will both qualify and not owe any
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:59.180]   federal income taxes on your first $212,000 of income split between the two of you.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.020]   Now the next question, will my wife owe Social Security and Medicare taxes on her business
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020]   income?
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.500]   The answer is it depends.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.780]   It depends on how she's structured.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:13.360]   So as things stand currently, she is working as a single member LLC in the United States.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.700]   And so if she simply moves abroad, she's still going to be working for her single member
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.300]   LLC in the United States and owning that.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.380]   And so yes, in that situation, she will owe employment taxes based upon how she has that
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.380]   structured.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.380]   If the single member LLC is electing to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, then she will
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.440]   owe self-employment taxes.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.380]   If the single member LLC is electing to be taxed as an S corporation, then she'll owe
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.460]   employment taxes on her salary.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.460]   Nothing will change there because she's working for an American company.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:50.740]   Now if she doesn't want to owe those employment taxes, what you could do is you could arrange
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.220]   for her to move her company offshore.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.820]   And the simple solution here, since she already owns a single member LLC, would be for her
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:05.420]   to keep everything as it is, but simply to transfer the member interests of her single
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:12.300]   member LLC from her ownership to the ownership of a foreign corporation.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.900]   And if she does that, then she will be able to eliminate her employment tax obligations
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   to the United States.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.460]   And here's why.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.600]   From the perspective of her customers, nothing will change.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.660]   With a single member LLC, nothing will change.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.900]   All of her bank accounts will still be there.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.860]   All of her, she can run her PayPal or her Stripe account.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.420]   She can sell everything.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.420]   Nothing will change.
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.960]   She can maintain her US-based address.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.860]   Everything is exactly like a US front-facing company.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.520]   And nothing has to change with regard to any of the infrastructure of her business.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.700]   But if she sells or otherwise transfers her single member LLC member units from her to
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.740]   a foreign corporation that she owns, what will happen is the IRS will ignore the existence
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.580]   of the single member LLC for tax purposes.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.620]   It becomes basically a transparent entity.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.600]   And the IRS will look up one level and say, "Who owns the single member LLC?"
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.660]   The single member LLC is a disregarded entity for tax purposes.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.180]   And so she can establish an offshore corporation.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.300]   She can transfer the member units of the LLC to the offshore corporation.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:25.940]   And now the IRS will view her as being the employee of an offshore corporation.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.500]   And as an employee of an offshore corporation who qualifies for the foreign earned income
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:38.580]   exclusion, now she will not currently owe any kind of employment taxes to the IRS because
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.260]   she no longer works for a US-based company.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.480]   The analog for you is very simple.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.460]   In the same way that you moved outside of the United States and you moved to a foreign
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:53.780]   country and you now start working for a foreign company, you no longer have to pay US-based
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.740]   employment taxes because you now have to pay local employment taxes.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.300]   Make sense?
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.260]   So the same thing applies to her.
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.660]   If she moves outside of the United States and she no longer works for a US-based company
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.660]   because of the fact that she now works for this offshore company, she will no longer
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:19.860]   owe United States employment taxes, but she may now owe offshore employment taxes.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.500]   And the answer as to whether she does or doesn't is going to depend on the jurisdiction in
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.260]   which you move.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.420]   Again, what are the laws of that local place?
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.740]   What are the laws in that local area?
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:38.820]   If the local jurisdiction allows her to work online and not legally owe any local employment
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.900]   taxes because they don't have a system of employment taxes or because an online business
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:49.260]   working in some other jurisdiction qualifies in a third place, then she could legally eliminate
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.260]   that obligation.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.460]   However, if she moves to a place where they require contributions to the local social
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.780]   insurance programs, then of course she's going to owe those contributions to the local social
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.780]   insurance programs.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.940]   So you've got to think about where you're leaving, which is the United States, and think
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.820]   about where you're going to, which I don't know, but you've got to research the laws
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.980]   of that local area.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.320]   And then the ideal solution is you want to be thoughtful.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.100]   From the tax perspective, which most people, taxes are not how they drive their life, nor
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.180]   should they be.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.660]   You want to move to a place because you want to live there.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.260]   You might consider taxes, but most of the time you just want to move there because that's
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.820]   where I want to live.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.460]   But to the extent that you're doing the tax planning as a primary consideration, you want
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.100]   to be thoughtful and strategic about the exact place that you go.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:39.340]   Now the fact that she works online may give her a little bit more liberty with the jurisdictions
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.860]   that she can work in than you have.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:49.060]   If you are an employee and you're working in one local place, you don't have any flexibility.
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.380]   Because in the same way that if a Japanese citizen moved to the United States and took
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.940]   up a job teaching in an international school in the United States, they would have to pay
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.140]   Social Security and Medicare, you have exactly the same thing if you go to Japan.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.460]   But with the online business thing, there may be a little bit more flexibility, but
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.120]   every jurisdiction is going to be different.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.300]   So you want to think through that carefully, but that's the way the law is structured.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.060]   Now is it worth it for her to go ahead and do that?
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   Well maybe, maybe not.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.500]   What I would say is the first thing is you're going to add some additional expense.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.740]   She already has a single member LLC, so she's already paying the fees to maintain that entity
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.340]   and to run her business through that.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.940]   If she establishes an offshore corporation, she will have to pay additional fees to maintain
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:35.660]   that to the country that issues that corporation.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.740]   Those fees can range from modest to quite expensive.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:44.060]   There are various jurisdictions that you can incorporate an international business company
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.620]   very easily with relatively low expenses.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.260]   There are other jurisdictions that are incredibly expensive.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.100]   Now from her situation, what I would say is I don't see any reason why she would need
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.020]   to have any kind of name brand expensive corporation.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.180]   She's not trying to start something where she's going to have physical employees all
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.340]   over the world and it makes all the difference in the world that she's based in Hong Kong
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.640]   instead of Bermuda or some Caribbean island.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.100]   The only person that's ever going to know that she has an offshore corporation is the
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.100]   IRS because she'll have to file additional tax forms for it.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.900]   But that's the only person that's ever going to know that she actually has an offshore
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   corporation.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.220]   Her clients, it'll be invisible to her clients because all the businesses, all the bank accounts,
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.540]   all of that stuff is run through the US based company.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.420]   But it will add some additional cost to her.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:35.640]   It'll add some additional expense to establish that corporation.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.960]   It also will add some additional expense to preparing the taxes.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.540]   If you own an offshore corporation, the tax burden, the paperwork burden becomes really
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.260]   onerous, really genuinely onerous.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.660]   And it's probably going to require you to hire a specialized offshore tax preparation
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:58.860]   expert which would be going rates, $500 a year, something like that, in that range to
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.260]   file the forms for her offshore corporation.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.260]   And so you have to ask yourself how much money am I actually going to be saving based upon
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.260]   this?
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.460]   If she's only going to owe a couple thousand dollars, if her income is $30,000 and she's
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:18.900]   going to owe 15% of that, it's only a few thousand dollars of actual cost, then it may
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.180]   not be worth the offshore thing, especially given the fact that in theory, employment
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.040]   taxes are somewhat refundable.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.300]   When you make contributions to the Social Security Administration, in theory, you might
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.260]   get some benefit from that someday.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.180]   When you make contributions to the Medicare system, in theory, you might get some benefit
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.180]   from that someday.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.060]   I don't count on that stuff much, but I'm fairly young.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.060]   But I imagine it'll be there in some way.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.780]   I just think it's a giant black hole Ponzi scheme that you have to throw money into.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.940]   But for someone who's older, it may be useful, right?
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:51.420]   Someone who's earning a high income and every year that they're earning $150,000 bumps out
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:56.160]   a year where they were earning $10,000 earlier in their Social Security calculation, okay,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.260]   it works out and that's a decent thing to do.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.700]   The other thing that you need to think about, depending on the country that you are going
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:07.580]   to is does the country that you're going to have a totalization agreement with the IRS?
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:14.260]   The foreign earned income exclusion does not depend upon any kind of interface with another
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.260]   country.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.260]   It doesn't depend on it.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.620]   It's just exclusively based upon are you in the United States or not.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.760]   But with regard to Social Security programs, you might want to look in, you know, you do
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.860]   want to look into does the country that I anticipate moving to have a totalization agreement
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.760]   with the United States?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.260]   So if you were moving to, I said earlier, the Netherlands, right?
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.260]   You're going to go and teach in an international school in the Netherlands.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:42.100]   Well, you look up the totalization agreement between the United States Social Security
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:48.880]   Administration and the Netherlands and basically instead of having to pay taxes to both systems,
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.060]   you can just have access to one system.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.940]   And so in her case, what you need to look at is, okay, if she's living in the Netherlands,
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:00.140]   if she's required to contribute to the local Dutch social insurance programs, can she receive
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.740]   credits for those under the Social Security tax system?
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.500]   In which case, the idea of needing to work for a foreign corporation may be unnecessary.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.340]   You'd have to ask the question of where do you reside and if you're self-employed, where
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.020]   do I pay the money, etc.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.860]   And so look into the totalization agreement.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.860]   And those are different.
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.580]   Those are bilateral agreements that have been negotiated between the United States and each
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:29.940]   of those countries and they exclusively affect your credits under the various social insurance
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.940]   systems.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.940]   And that can be quite helpful for you.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.820]   So you need to understand that and that's dependent on the specific country that you're
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.820]   involved in.
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:42.780]   Now, the benefit that I've talked about for US citizens, there are a lot of disadvantages
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.700]   to being a US citizen.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.000]   One of them, one big one is the citizenship-based taxation.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.180]   But an advantage for US citizens is because you're already considered to be a US taxpayer,
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.700]   if you want to, you can set up fairly easily a lifestyle where you just simply don't become
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.860]   a tax resident of other countries.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.200]   Now that's not going to work if you are sitting in one place.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.420]   But let's say that you started an educational, instead of teaching inside a physical classroom,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.460]   you took your teaching online and you started teaching your subject matter expertise to
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.140]   students online.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.160]   And instead of choosing one country to move to, you chose a couple or three countries
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.220]   to move to, and you spent time in each of those three countries.
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.620]   Well now, you can put yourself in a situation where yes, you are still subject to the US
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.020]   tax system, subject to the foreign earned income exclusion as we've talked about, but
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.020]   you now have a freedom from those other countries.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:44.100]   You don't have to be a part of the Netherlands, of the Dutch social insurance program, if
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.620]   you're only in the Netherlands for three months, because you don't become a tax resident any
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:52.260]   more than any other visitor comes for 90 days.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.900]   And so if you both were working online and if you wanted to live that kind of flexible
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:04.180]   move around nomad lifestyle, then that can result in a superior tax structure for you
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.580]   that would allow you legally to live tax free if you have a business, an actual business.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.860]   You can't do that as a freelancer, but if you have an actual business, that could allow
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:18.140]   you to live totally tax free on your first $106,000 for you and your first $106,000 for
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.260]   your wife.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.860]   Most people don't want to do that.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.420]   Most of that's not going to be relevant for most people, but it is an option if to the
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.740]   extent that the taxes pay factor into your overall situation.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:35.780]   Now before we go on to the other two questions that you asked, I want to make a comment on
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.500]   the foreign tax credit, because the foreign earned income exclusion and the foreign tax
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.500]   credit function separately.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.380]   They're not the same.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.400]   You can qualify for the foreign tax credit without qualifying for the foreign earned
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.520]   income exclusion.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.500]   So here would be a simple example.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.620]   So you move to the Netherlands and you're in the Netherlands for eight months every
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:04.380]   year and based upon tax residency in the Netherlands, you owe the Netherlands a tax on your income.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.900]   Pretend that your wife owes the Netherlands tax on her income because she's a tax resident
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:08.940]   of the Netherlands.
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.880]   You're both enrolled in the local Dutch social insurance programs and you're quite happy
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.460]   to do that because you owe the tax.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.180]   Well in this situation, you're going to be paying a higher tax rate in the Netherlands
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.300]   than you are in the United States, but in this situation it doesn't matter whether you
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.980]   qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion or not, because what you could do is you could
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.620]   take a foreign tax credit.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:37.380]   So what you would do is you would reduce your US taxes by the amount that you are paying
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.820]   in foreign taxes.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.140]   So if you move from the United States to a higher tax jurisdiction and you wind up owing
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.780]   more taxes to that foreign jurisdiction, then the foreign earned income exclusion doesn't
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.500]   matter because you could actually zero out your tax obligation to the United States based
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.540]   upon the foreign tax credits, not based upon the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.820]   So if your decision is a lifestyle decision, we want to live in Amsterdam, we love it here
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.620]   and we just want to live here, but we're going to go back to the United States for four months
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.020]   a year, doesn't really matter if you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion or
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.660]   not because you're paying more to the Dutch government.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.580]   And so you can take a foreign tax credit of your foreign taxes paid and since those foreign
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.300]   taxes will be higher than the United States taxes, you'll wind up with a net tax liability
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.260]   to the United States government of basically zero dollars.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.300]   Now if you move to a lower tax jurisdiction, if you were teaching in Dubai instead of the
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.220]   United States, then now all of a sudden that's where that tax planning really comes into
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:40.700]   play where you've got to make sure that because you're now not paying any foreign income taxes,
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.180]   you can't take a foreign tax credit to the United States government.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:50.180]   And so now the foreign earned income exclusion is your exclusive tax savings for the US government.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.300]   So it all depends on what jurisdiction you're going to.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.500]   Question number four that you have asked, will my wife owe taxes to the state of Ohio
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   on her business income?
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:04.740]   The answer is depends on the state of Ohio on what the state of Ohio considers to be
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.980]   income and what they charge for you and also for a company that is a tax resident of that
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.060]   state.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.660]   And so you've got to do the research for you and also for the business.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:21.860]   So the first thing is you look up, go to duckduckgo.com and search Ohio tax residency and you'll pull
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:27.780]   up the page for your state and it'll tell you what Ohio considers to be tax residency
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.380]   for an individual.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.060]   These tax residency requirements vary across the states.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.060]   I don't know what they are for Ohio, easy for you to find it out.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:39.220]   But usually many of them, if you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, many
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.120]   states will use that as a tax residency test or they might have some other test.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.760]   And so if you're physically not present in that state, generally it's easy enough for
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:53.020]   you to avoid the taxes and most states are going to be fine that way.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.020]   What I'd recommend to you is if your state will easily allow you to not be a resident
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.740]   of that state for you for personal income taxes because you are abroad and if you're
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.100]   going to be abroad, then it'll be easiest for you just to keep your infrastructure set
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.100]   up in that state.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.660]   You already have your Ohio driver's licenses, you have an Ohio address, maybe move your
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.540]   address from your house to your mom's house so that she can collect the mail for you.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.460]   You update, use that address on your driver's license, move your credit cards there, etc.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.700]   But you can just keep all your infrastructure in that state.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.220]   The reason why you might want to do that is because it'll keep some of your other financial
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.180]   planning documents more in order.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.820]   So for example, your will, you might have a will that was subject to the state laws
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:30.820]   of Ohio.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   Well, that's your will that's enforced because your domicile is in Ohio.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.900]   If you're moving abroad for a couple of years, you wouldn't want to move your domicile
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.780]   to another state and then put in force a will that's enforced under the laws of another
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.780]   state.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.140]   So keep your state if you can easily enough avoid tax residency in your state for you.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:52.020]   However, what about for your, what about for your, well, what if they don't allow that?
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.660]   What if the tax residency laws in your state are really onerous, right?
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.740]   You live in California or New York and they're just totally, they're going to get you even
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.900]   if you don't qualify.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:06.740]   Sorry, Californians and New Yorkers, just my mouth gets ahead of me sometimes.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.180]   But it is true, super aggressive states.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.940]   Well, in that situation, move to another state.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.980]   So you would move to a no income tax state would be the simplest and most obvious solution.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.380]   You know, South Dakota would be good.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.380]   Texas would be good.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.940]   Florida would be good.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.100]   Wyoming would work.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.060]   Just move to a Nevada, other no income tax states.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.740]   The easy ones, if you're going to be truly abroad, you'll find that South Dakota and
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:36.860]   Texas and Florida work really well for you because they allow nomad residency in those
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   states.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.140]   But move yourself and all your stuff to one of those states.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.740]   And if you do that, then you can properly move out of the state of high taxes.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.940]   And you want to do that before you go abroad.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   Now what about the business?
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.320]   Well, again, check the laws of business residency in the state.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:56.040]   If the business is being taxed at the entity level, then yes, if the business is located
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.000]   in that state, then it's going to be taxed.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.440]   And so the same thing applies.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.380]   Find out what tax residency qualifies for in your state based upon the business being
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.600]   there and how the state imposes taxes on that.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.320]   And then move your business to a no income tax state.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:19.100]   So you can move your business from a state like from Ohio to Nevada or to Wyoming and
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.820]   just simply move your LLC outside of the state of Ohio to one of those states.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:29.820]   And then you would avoid needing to owe taxes to that state in which the LLC is there.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.540]   Now for a digital business, if she's a digital marketing consultant, that probably should
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.420]   have been done probably in the first place.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.860]   If you have a business that has physical property in a certain state, then you almost always
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:46.060]   need, it's almost always easier to register that business in your actual state of residence.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.040]   Because when you go to register, you know, you've got a pool company.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:55.460]   When you go to register your vans with a local DMV, they're going to pull up the local state
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.340]   corporate filings and say, "Are you registered in our state?"
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.960]   And you've got to be registered in the state in which you do business.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.060]   But with something like a marketing consulting business or a digital business, it should
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.100]   be fairly easy for her to just use one of those other business friendly states that
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.540]   don't impose taxes in the first place.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.940]   And so that's what I would do from the very beginning is make sure that her business income
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:21.120]   is being earned in a state that doesn't charge taxes at the business level.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:24.860]   And so she might need to move, if Ohio is unfriendly to that, she might need to move
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:31.560]   her Ohio single member LLC to a single member LLC from another state.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.960]   Number five, does my wife, so that's the answer to number four, would my wife owe taxes in
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.300]   the state of Ohio on her business income?
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.520]   Number five, does my wife owe any taxes to the country where we will be living?
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.340]   Answer is, it depends on the laws of that country.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.680]   For most countries, the vast majority of countries, the answer is yes.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:53.080]   If you move to that country and you live in that country, you're going to owe taxes to
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.860]   that country because most countries are going to impose income taxes on you.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.520]   Now there are a few exceptions to that and your wife may or may not qualify to one of
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   those exceptions based upon where she's earning her income.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.400]   So if you move to Canada, you're not going to qualify because Canada has a very similar
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.080]   tax system to the United States, except it's residency based.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.280]   You're going to owe taxes on your worldwide income.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.200]   And so her offshore company is not going to save her any money in Canada.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.800]   In fact, it could make everything more complicated.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.720]   However, if you move to a country that has a territorial system of taxation, either no
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.300]   taxes due, the Bahamas, Dubai, Cayman Islands, et cetera, or you move to a country that has
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.400]   a territorial tax system, then it should be much more doable for you to establish the
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.100]   ability for her income to be earned offshore.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.040]   So the big premier territorial tax jurisdictions would be places like Hong Kong, Singapore,
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.480]   close to the United States would be Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, what else?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.840]   There's Malaysia, there's a bunch of them.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.120]   There's Paraguay sometimes, Uruguay, you could set up a zero tax residency in Uruguay if
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.880]   you don't sell to Uruguay.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.440]   And so there'd be a number of different ways that depending on the country that you're
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.880]   going to where you can set it up.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:15.620]   And so let's say that she has her company in a foreign country and let's say you move
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.740]   to Singapore, right?
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.140]   But she runs her business through a Panama IBC.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.020]   Well, in that situation, because her income is being earned outside of the jurisdiction
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.700]   of Singapore, she wouldn't owe the Singapore government any taxes on her income because
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.940]   she's not earning any income in Singapore.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.180]   You would because you're earning income in Singapore, but she would not.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.720]   And there are bunches, about 25 territorial tax countries in the world that you could
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.320]   consider that have those kinds of laws.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.300]   I think that's the most just system of income taxation.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:55.640]   So I think those are good signs of a good place to go, but that's the answer.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.980]   So I think I've answered all your questions.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.120]   They are complex though.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.880]   And the reason why you're getting a lot of different answers on this stuff is because
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.700]   it's extraordinarily complex.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.560]   You've got to deal with basically four different sets of tax codes.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.920]   You have to deal with income taxes and employment taxes in the United States.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.820]   And then you have to deal with income taxes and employment taxes in the country, in your
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.520]   destination country.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.720]   And those are all very intertwined and it's very unusual that you would find somebody
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.400]   who is competent in all of those things.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.120]   I'm not even competent because there's so many countries in the world.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.900]   So I'm giving you broad brush advice.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:35.860]   But what you would want to do is you would want to get advice from the US perspective,
[00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.620]   which I've just given to you, and then you would want to get advice in your local perspective.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.460]   And so you'll need to speak to somebody locally because the Irish laws are going to be very
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.940]   different than the Dubai laws.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.560]   It would be very different than the Panama City laws.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.840]   And so you do need that local expertise, but that's why you're getting a bunch of different
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.500]   answers.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.420]   The most important thing that you're going to need to home in on is what country you're
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:04.260]   actually going to be working in because that's going to make all the difference in the world
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.680]   in terms of what tax treaties does that country have.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.140]   So if you were a Brit, right, and you come to me and I'm doing tax planning, well, what
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.460]   you do, the first thing you do is sit down and say, "What are the tax treaties that each
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.860]   country has?"
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.380]   And so this makes all the difference in the world with where you go.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.380]   For US citizens, it doesn't.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:28.260]   And that's why I'm zooming in on, and I made very clear that this structure was very different.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:31.140]   But because for US citizens, it doesn't matter where you go.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.360]   And for US citizens, you can live totally tax-free if you're willing to move around
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.980]   and not become a tax resident of another place.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.220]   But that's very different than if you for other people.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.200]   And so what would happen is depending on the country you go to, that's going to drive the
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.940]   exact taxes that you're exposed to.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.700]   You could move to, I mean, there's so many little tax havens that you could do.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.300]   I can't give more examples, otherwise I'd just go too far off.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.720]   But it matters where you go to.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.140]   So let's say that you say, "Okay, I'm going to move to Portugal, and we're going to become
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.500]   non-habitual residents for Portugal.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.140]   And I'm going to teach in a local school, but she's going to maintain a non-habitual
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.700]   resident scheme so that she can enjoy the tax exemption in Portugal."
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   Great.
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.700]   That can work out really well.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.500]   In which case, everything is simpler, though.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.460]   But it's because of the wrinkles within the Portuguese system.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:33.100]   It's a really good option right now for many people around the world who want a chance
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:39.260]   to live in Europe and who don't, again, for non-Americans or if you're trying to create
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.700]   a tax-efficient thing locally.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:47.240]   If you want to live in Europe, but you want to live in Europe tax-efficiently, applying
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.260]   for the Portugal Golden Visa program and becoming a non-habitual tax resident gives you access
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.860]   to the European Union, gives you the ability to live there, and you can eliminate your
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:01.620]   taxes or keep them very low, depending on the deal that you set up, for 10 years.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.460]   And that's really powerful.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.660]   But that's a unique thing to Portugal that Spain does not offer.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:13.300]   So clarify the country you're going to and then research that country's taxes.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.180]   And then part of your research will then have to go to what tax treaties does that country
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   have.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:25.140]   At the end of the day, what I would say is don't make your decision based exclusively
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.140]   on taxes.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.220]   I think, you know, I'm a nerd about taxes.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.220]   It's important to me.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.620]   I see the value of saving money on taxes.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:40.020]   At the end of the day, though, if saving money on taxes causes you to try to have to live
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.020]   somewhere where you don't want to live or causes you to try to have to do something
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.660]   that you don't want to do or live a lifestyle that you don't want to live, then it just
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.020]   doesn't seem worth it.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.420]   It doesn't seem worth it.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.700]   Now as a balancing factor, let's say you're trying to choose between do I want to live
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:03.720]   in Moscow or do I want to live in London?
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.300]   And I can live in Russia and I can pay 10 or maybe 13% on my income.
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.300]   Or if I live in London, I'm not going to be a non-domiciled.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.740]   I'm going to, you know, oh, 50%.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.580]   All of a sudden now Moscow is looking a little bit better.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.100]   You know, Russia is a very, very reasonable low tax place.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.640]   And you know, I want to live in the culture.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.120]   But it can't be just the only thing.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.740]   If you don't want to live in Russia and you're just moving there for income taxes, it's not
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   going to work.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:35.060]   But if you want to live in Russia because you like the culture and you enjoy, you know,
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.260]   the city and you enjoy everything about it and the taxes is one, you know, cherry on
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.100]   top, then I think it makes sense.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:46.440]   I just don't think it makes sense to start with tax planning as your primary solution.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.960]   Most people who leave the United States don't leave for the purpose of tax savings.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.300]   Most people leave the United States move to higher tax jurisdictions, right?
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   They move to Canada.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.700]   They move to Mexico.
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.060]   They move to the UK.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.220]   They move to Australia.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.540]   All of those jurisdictions are higher tax jurisdictions in the United States.
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:05.300]   Very few people live in the Bahamas full time just because they can do it with no tax.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:11.140]   Now that varies depending on the amount of income that you're earning.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:17.900]   If you're making, you know, I remember a year or so ago there was a guy who called into
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.060]   the show who had been living in the Cayman Islands.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.340]   I think he was making half a million, $700,000 a year, something like that.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.740]   Well, the US taxpayer is paying a couple hundred thousand dollars per year of taxes to the
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.780]   United States and for what?
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.860]   For what benefit, right?
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:36.100]   So he can hold a blue passport, didn't go back to the United States, lives in the Cayman
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.100]   Islands.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.300]   In that situation, it's stupid.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.740]   I think it's silly.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:42.740]   Stupid was too strong.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.220]   In that situation, it's silly.
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:50.000]   Why should you pay the United States $250,000 a year of taxes when you could just simply
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.260]   go and buy yourself a, you know, a citizenship with any of the Caribbean citizenship by investment
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.860]   programs, Dominica or St. Kitts or Granada or St. Lucia, any of them, right?
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:07.340]   Buy yourself a citizenship from any of those for $100,000 to $200,000 and renounce your
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.620]   US citizenship.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.420]   And now every year going forward, all of your income is now income tax free from the benefit
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.040]   of living in the Cayman Islands.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:22.740]   Because if you are a, you know, a Dominican living in the Cayman Islands earning $700,000
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:29.580]   a year, the full $700,000 is going right in your pocket instead of siphoning off $250,000
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.420]   to go to the US government.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.540]   In that kind of situation, it makes a lot more sense to think carefully about tax planning
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.880]   because the numbers are big.
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:44.260]   But if you're earning $50,000 as a teacher, as a classroom teacher, the tax obligation
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:51.080]   of $50,000 as far as income taxes is not so substantial that it's going to be life-changing
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.080]   for you.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.420]   And so in that situation, I think you go, "Where do I want to go?"
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:00.940]   And so hopefully that gives a little texture to the advice, but I think it's a great question.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.260]   Hopefully my answer helps you.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:03.260]   And I would say good luck.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.260]   Hope you enjoy it.
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:05.580]   Thank you all for listening to the show.
