[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   Continuing our examination and study of the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   we come this evening to verses 10 and 11, in the seventh chapter of Paul's Epistle
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.200]   to the Romans.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.440]   And the commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death, for sin, taking
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.640]   occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.920]   Here continues, you see, this tremendously important statement which the great apostle
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.880]   is making in this section with regard to the character and the function and the purpose
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.480]   of the law.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.680]   It is indeed, as we have been seeing, a most important subject, one which is in every way
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.360]   essential to a true understanding of the gospel.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.560]   It is a subject that is of importance not only before we become Christians, but equally
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.960]   important afterwards.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.760]   For the apostle is setting out to prove here not only that there is no such thing as justification
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.920]   by the law, but there is also no such thing as sanctification by the law.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.960]   And all of us must know from experience how easy it is to fall into the second error as
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.920]   well as into the first.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.500]   Now then, what he is doing here in these two verses is this.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.480]   He is summing up what he has been saying in detail in the previous verses.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.800]   There he has been telling us, you remember, what had actually been happening to him.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.340]   I was alive without the law once, at that time sin was also dead, but then he said the
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.400]   law came, the commandment came and found me and really addressed me, and it happened at
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800]   once that sin revived and I died.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   Well now, he wants therefore to sum up at this point his argument about the law.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.520]   He says therefore it comes to this, that the commandment which was ordained to life, I
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.160]   found to be unto death.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.640]   Now all these terms, again we must realize, are important.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.920]   Now look first of all at this term "I found".
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.200]   He doesn't mean by that that as the result of careful study and examination he came to
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600]   this conclusion.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.840]   It sounds as if he is saying that, but that isn't what he said at all.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.280]   What he is really saying is this, the commandment which was ordained to life was found in my
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   case to be unto death.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.680]   Now that's a better way of translating it and of putting it.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.880]   In other words, the finding is not the result of his investigation, but it was something
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.400]   that he discovered as the result of experience.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.200]   He found himself in the position of having realized that.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   That's what he means.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.920]   All right, well now then, let's go and examine the other statements.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.680]   Here is an important statement.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.720]   The commandment, he says, which was ordained to life.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.960]   And everybody who is a careful student of Scripture must at once feel rather surprised
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   at that statement, because we know that the Apostle has been spending the early chapters
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.160]   of this epistle in proving that there is no such thing as anybody finding life by the
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   law.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.960]   For instance, he summed up his great argument in chapter 3 and in verse 20 by saying this,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.360]   "Therefore, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, for by
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.400]   the law is the knowledge of sin."
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.800]   He has taken all that time to say that nobody can ever find life by the law, that the whole
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.520]   trouble and fallacy with the Jews was that they were seeking life by the law.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.600]   And yet here he seems to contradict himself completely by saying, "The commandment which
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.400]   was ordained to life I found to be unto death."
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.640]   Now then, what does he mean?
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.840]   Well, how does one face a problem like this?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.160]   Let's look at it very generally, first of all, as a matter of scriptural interpretation.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:38.720]   Well, you start by saying something like this, that obviously it cannot have its face, meaning
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   and value.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   Otherwise, it involves the Apostle in a blank contradiction of himself.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.520]   Not only that, if it meant that, he would indeed be undermining everything that he's
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.000]   been saying and establishing.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.280]   His great message would have gone once and forever, so it cannot possibly mean that.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.960]   And that's a very good principle, Elvis, to use.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.920]   If the apparent meaning, the first meaning that suggests itself to you, is in obvious
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.720]   contradiction to some plain teaching of the scripture, well, it can't be the truth.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.800]   And therefore you've got to seek for another explanation.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   What then does it mean?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.360]   Well, it clearly means this.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.220]   He's not saying that the commandment was given in order that people through it might
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.280]   obtain life.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.840]   But what he is saying is this, that if men and women had kept the commandment, if it
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.640]   had been possible for anybody to do so, then it would have led to life.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.640]   Why?
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   For this reason.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.400]   That the commandment, as he's going to tell us, is holy, and just, and good.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.480]   The commandment, after all, is the most perfect indication of the way of holiness and of happiness
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.920]   that has ever been given.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.360]   God when he gave the commandment, the law, the moral law, was outlining a way of life
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.320]   which would be well-pleasing in his sight.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.760]   That is the way of life.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.840]   And that is all that the apostle is saying here about it.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.880]   Here is God's law, which teaches us what the holy and the happy life really is, the
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.400]   life that is pleasing unto God.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:35.960]   And yet he says, in my case, I found that it produced and led to death.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.840]   Now then, let me give you some other illustrations to show that that is the meaning.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.780]   Take, for instance, what the apostle will go on to say in chapter 10, verse 5.
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:55.480]   He says that Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law like this, that the man
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:01.240]   which doeth those things shall live by them.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   Which means this.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.280]   He says, when Moses gave the law, he said to the people in effect, if you keep this
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.080]   law you will have life, eternal life.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   Yes, if you do.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.120]   There it is again, you see the same thing.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:23.200]   Or go right back, if you like, to Exodus chapter 19 and verse 5, when God spoke to Moses about
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.760]   the giving of the law to the people.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.560]   This is what he said.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:36.760]   Now therefore, if ye will obey my vice indeed and keep my commandments, then ye shall be
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.200]   a peculiar treasure unto me above all people, for all the earth is mine, and ye shall be
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.000]   But you notice the "if" again, it's conditional.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.640]   Or take it as it's expressed in the book of Leviticus, chapter 18, verse 5.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:08.120]   Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which, if a man do, he shall live
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120]   in them.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.720]   Now that was what Paul was quoting in the 10th chapter of this epistle, in verse 5.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.400]   Leviticus 18, 5.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   Or take it again in Deuteronomy 6, 25.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   And it shall be our righteousness, says Moses to the people, if we observe to do all the
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.120]   commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commended us.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   It shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   But we've got a still higher authority for our interpretation, and that is our Lord himself.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.240]   In the gospel according to St. Luke, in chapter 10, you get towards the end an account of
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.260]   an interview between a certain lawyer and our Lord.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:08.680]   And our Lord said to this man, "Well, what are your ideas about this eternal life which
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.200]   I'm speaking about?"
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.360]   And the man answered and said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.980]   soul and mind and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself."
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.680]   And our Lord said unto him, "Thou hast answered right.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.960]   This do and thou shalt live."
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960]   Now that's it.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.760]   The commandment was ordained unto life.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.760]   That's the commandment.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.800]   Loving the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength, and thy neighbor
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   as thyself.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.360]   Now, says our Lord, you're perfectly right.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.820]   You do that and you shall have life.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.880]   You shall live.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.480]   But you notice again that it is the condition.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.520]   If you do this, this do, and thou shalt live.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   Very well.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:01.560]   There are a number of statements then which justify the apostle in using this expression.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.600]   The commandment which was ordained unto life.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.700]   Yes, but you see, you've got to balance it in the way I've been indicating and which
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.800]   the apostle states quite explicitly.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:23.440]   In Galatians 3.21, where he says this, "If there had been a law, if there had been a
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.800]   law given which could have given life, verily, righteousness should have been, would have
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.040]   been, by the law."
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:39.120]   Now that is the statement that you must put up over against this one, in order to see
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.680]   what the apostle is saying.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:49.840]   He says, "If there had been a law given which could have given life, verily, righteousness
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.160]   should or would have been by the law."
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.440]   It couldn't happen, so it hasn't happened.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.560]   Well then, what is the truth about the law?
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.040]   Well, the truth about the law is this, that it is this perfect expression of what is necessary,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.960]   if a man could do it, to obtain life.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.860]   But as he will tell us again in the next chapter, chapter 8, in verse 3, what the law could
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.640]   not do, in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   That's it.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.240]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.920]   the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.880]   the flesh, but after the Spirit.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:39.960]   Very well, then, none of us need stumble over that particular phrase about the law which
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.160]   was ordained unto life.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.480]   Then that brings us to the next statement.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.600]   The law which, the commandment which was ordained to life, was found in my case to lead unto
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.320]   death.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.680]   We needn't stay with this in the sense we've already been dealing with it.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:08.400]   What he's saying is this, this is what happened when the commandment had really come to him.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.920]   You remember, when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.800]   It's just another way, really, of saying that.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:25.880]   But that we can put it like this, the law far from giving me life and happiness and
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:32.400]   holiness and joy, says the apostle, did the exact opposite.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:40.840]   It condemned me, it showed me my failure, it showed me my evil nature, it inflamed sin
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:47.200]   within me and therefore revealed to me my utter helplessness and left me in a state
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.560]   of complete misery.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.960]   You remember we took the words life and death last time and saw exactly what they meant.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.800]   That the apostle, when he says I was alive once, meant ah, I was very happy, I was pleased
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.280]   with myself, I was self-confident, I felt I could do it.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.480]   That was life, and death, you remember, was the exact opposite.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.680]   The realization that he couldn't, the sense of condemnation, the misery because of his
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   complete failure.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.520]   Well now then, why was this?
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.400]   Why did it come to pass in this case, in the apostle's case, that the law which was ordained
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:31.680]   unto life was found to be unto death?
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.520]   And the answer is, of course, as he's been telling us already and as he's going on
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.400]   to tell us in the next verse, it was all because of sin, and because of what sin does with
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.120]   the law, and did with the law in the case of the apostle, in the case of all the Pharisees
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.400]   and most of the Jews.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:55.760]   If you like, we can sum it up by what he will say later in chapter 9 in verse 32.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.360]   Verse 31 as well, "But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.960]   to the law of righteousness."
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Wherefore?
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:11.640]   "Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for they
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.600]   stumbled at that stumbling stone."
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.860]   That's the trouble, that's the stumbling stone.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.360]   You see, they didn't make the right use of the law, that's the trouble.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.000]   Sin so affected them that though this law of God had been given to them, they made the
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.800]   wrong use of it.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.480]   They used it as a way of righteousness, as I'm going to show you.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:41.680]   Now, the apostle has a very illuminating statement which throws light on what he's saying here
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.160]   in his first epistle to Timothy, in the first chapter and in the eighth verse, where he
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:57.640]   says this, "We know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully."
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:04.240]   Now there's the illuminating statement, the law is a very good thing on condition that
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.640]   you use it in the right way, if you use it lawfully.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:16.480]   But the trouble is, because of sin, we don't use it lawfully, and that is why he found
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.040]   in his case, as he says, that the commandment which was ordained unto life he found to be
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   unto death.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.880]   Or, if you like, we can put it like this.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:38.600]   He's saying here, what he says in 1 Corinthians 15, 56, in these well-known words, "The sting
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:48.960]   of death is sin," ah yes, "and the strength of sin is the law."
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.520]   Now, the sting of death, the thing that really kills in death, is sin.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   That's what makes death what it is, is sin.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.560]   Yes, and what puts power into sin is the law.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.920]   Now that was what he was saying, you see, last time.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.000]   Without the law, sin was dead, there it was, as if it wasn't in existence at all, taking
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.840]   over, as I say, like that powerful engine, but apparently nothing happening.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.480]   Ah, yes, but the commandment came, pressure was put on the accelerator, sin revived, I
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   died.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:33.440]   The sting of death is sin, and the thing that puts the power into the sting is this law.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:40.240]   And we've already been considering some of the ways in which sin does that.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:47.900]   We saw how it increases this whole lust and passion, concupiscence, this inflaming of
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.560]   the passions, what he'd already said in verse 5.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:59.280]   And in addition, of course, it leads to condemnation, and misery, and failure.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:05.840]   So that the apostle will be perfectly justified when he comes to chapter 8, in verse 2, and
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.200]   it seems that all he's been saying in chapter 7, "For the law, the spirit of life in Christ
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.160]   Jesus, hath made me free."
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   From what?
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:23.520]   Well, from that law, which I must now describe as a law of sin and of death.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:32.800]   The commandment which was ordained unto life has become a commandment, a law of sin and
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   of death.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:40.000]   It aggravates sin, and therefore leads to death, still more certainly.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.520]   So there he actually refers to this law of God as a law of sin and death, because that
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.720]   is exactly what it is to the whole of the human race, as the result of the fall, and
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.080]   as the result of sin.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.760]   All right, now there we've looked at the particular statements in this tenth verse.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.520]   Now we'll go on to verse 11, which is an explanation of verse 10.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.840]   That's his method.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.920]   You see how careful he is?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.360]   "For"—he throws out his statement first in a general way—"the commandment which
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.320]   was ordained unto life, I found to be unto death."
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   Well, how?
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320]   Why?
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:25.120]   "For"—here's the answer—"for sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceive
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:30.960]   me, and by it slew me."
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:38.160]   Now here is again another of these explanations of his.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.280]   Why does he go on repeating this?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.920]   Why does he go on saying it in different ways?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.040]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.560]   It's the thing I said at the very beginning this evening.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.080]   To understand the biblical doctrine of sin is absolutely crucial in an understanding
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.840]   of the biblical doctrine of salvation.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.200]   It's no use, my friends, you'll not be right and clear about salvation unless you're right
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.320]   and clear about sin.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.000]   It's not surprising the apostle is so concerned about this and goes on repeating it.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.880]   He looks back across his own life and he says, "How could I have been so stupid?
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.840]   How could I have spent so many years in that condition?"
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.880]   And he says, "This was the whole explanation.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:29.040]   It was because of this that I was held so long in blindness and in bondage."
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.400]   And he knew it was the case with many of the people to whom he was writing.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.200]   He knew it was still the case with all the Jews, blinded, held in bondage.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.040]   So he's almost desperate about this.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.840]   He says, "I must make this clear."
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.320]   And so he puts it once more, "For sin" - sin is the trouble.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.000]   He's already been showing something of what sin does, "But sin," he said in verse 8, "taking
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.320]   occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence."
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.800]   Here he says, "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment to save me."
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:08.300]   Two statements as to what sin does in this terrible way.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.520]   So he goes on repeating it, but there is, as we shall see, an addition to the thought
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.520]   also.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:23.340]   Now then, as we come to look at this statement in verse 11, I want also in my little way
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.640]   to show the importance of repeating all this.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.080]   Why am I going to underline it and emphasize and take it again in detail and analyze it?
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:41.440]   Well for this reason, that this is still the greatest cause of trouble with all people
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.080]   as regards Christian salvation.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:51.120]   This is still the greatest cause of trouble in the life of individuals.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.760]   How many people are there outside the kingdom of God tonight solely for this reason?
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:02.120]   That they've never understood the meaning of the law and what sin does with the law.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.520]   It's one of the commonest stumbling blocks still standing between people in salvation.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.480]   And likewise, it still causes trouble in the Christian life.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.080]   There are people under bondage putting themselves back under the law as far as experience is
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   concerned and spending their Christian life in shallows and in miseries simply because
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.260]   they've never understood this.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.440]   So we must repeat it.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:35.360]   But not only that, as I am saying almost every Friday and I'm going to do it again tonight,
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   here is the ultimate key, the only answer and solution to the greatest problem confronting
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   this country today, which is the moral problem.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.960]   Now then, let me give you some evidence which I have seen only this week again in a newspaper.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.400]   It's just a report.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.960]   Listen to this, "Britain's standards of morality are bitterly attacked today by the National
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.620]   Association seeking to care for women discharged from jail.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:18.440]   The association criticizes a current situation in which 'downright dishonesty can be considered
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:25.280]   a clever fiddle' and vice is obviously exploited for commercial gain."
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.120]   End of quotations.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.720]   It frankly, this report frankly gives warning that no amount of research into the causes
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.760]   of crime or suggestions for combating it are likely to achieve much progress while Christian
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:48.040]   standards of morality remain so widely disregarded.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.720]   Now you see that comes in a newspaper report about an outside body, but listen, a similar
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:03.840]   disturbing report is made by Mr. Frank C. Foster, director of the Bostel aftercare division.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.920]   Last year, Mr. Foster points out, marked the 50th anniversary of the Bostel system as a
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.240]   statutory form of treatment.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:21.640]   And listen, after 50 years of it, committals were higher than ever, and he shows more,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.840]   and he shows more than twice what they were three years earlier.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.600]   "I am more than ever convinced," writes Mr. Foster, "that the offenders we have been dealing
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:39.640]   with of recent years present more difficult problems than ever before.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   We know that they are in the main the product of homes and community groups having unsympathetic
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:55.500]   attitudes towards education, work, recreation, social responsibility, and religion."
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:00.920]   Then he adds, "There is nothing new about this, but we seem now to be dealing with a
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:07.120]   generation that can best be described as having a low threshold of stress and a low tolerance
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   of frustration."
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.040]   Why have I read all that?
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   I have read it all for this reason.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:19.120]   You see, for 50 years and more, not only have we had the Bostel system, but the whole idea
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.800]   has been that you can solve these moral problems and problems of behavior by education and
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   teaching and culture, and by reforms, that you punish less and less and you do all this
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.160]   educational work.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.440]   But you see the statistics?
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.600]   More cases than ever, in spite of the fact that we have multiplied all these investigations
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.600]   and institutions.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:47.720]   Here are the sheer facts that are put before us by the people whose livelihood and work
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.200]   it is to deal with these matters.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.680]   When will they learn to read and to understand Romans 7?
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.520]   When will men and women realize that the problem is the problem of sin, the biblical problem
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   of sin?
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.600]   Here is one of their own companies that says, "We are wasting our time in a sense by investigating
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.440]   this and setting up research commissions to try and discover the cause and to try and
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   invent some new treatments.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.480]   It is no good," says the man, "we have been doing it and things are getting worse."
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.960]   No, no, there is only one explanation.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:32.040]   It is this terrible power which the Bible calls sin, and which men in their cleverness
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.840]   and sophistication no longer believe in, which they have been trying to explain away in terms
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.820]   of psychology, saying it is non-existent, and because of that they can easily train
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.280]   and teach people how to behave in a decent manner and how they can deliver delinquents.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.880]   And yet they are failing, failing so badly that their own servants are saying so in public.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:59.960]   Oh, no, there is only one explanation, but sin, taking occasion, using it as a vantage
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   point, using it as a military base of operations, using it as a fulcrum, sin taking occasion.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:13.080]   He repeats the phrase that is already used in verse 8.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.800]   But now we add something to it here.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:23.320]   There in verse 8 he told us this, "that sin wrought in me."
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:29.520]   And of course there, as we saw, he was emphasizing the power of sin.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:37.120]   And we dwelt on it because it is next to God the greatest power in the universe.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.200]   But here he is emphasizing another element of sin, and that is its deceitfulness.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.080]   "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me."
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.160]   Now this translation isn't quite good enough.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.520]   The apostle used a very strong word here, I must add to it.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.720]   He said, "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, completely deceived me."
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:03.520]   It took me in completely, not in a slight way, but it really was fundamental.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.000]   It took me in altogether, it deceived me absolutely.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.920]   That's what the apostle used, that was the word that he used.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:16.600]   Very well then, we've got to realize that sin is not only something terribly powerful,
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.080]   but is at the same time something terribly deceitful.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.920]   Now can anybody fail to see this?
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.200]   The Bible is full of this teaching.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.280]   Let me again give you some quotations.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.200]   I'm taking no risks.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.640]   Christians are influenced by what they read and by this popular psychology.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.120]   Even Christian people don't seem to believe in sin any longer.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.800]   Well, let me show you then, if you don't, you're denying the whole Bible.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.680]   Genesis 3, 13, "And the Lord God said unto the woman, 'What is this that thou has done?'
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.720]   And the woman said, 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.'
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.560]   Yes, said Moses, as he wrote the account, the serpent was more subtle than all the beasts
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   of the field."
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:05.160]   And then the apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, 2nd Epistle, chapter 11, verse
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:11.360]   3, takes it up and says, "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:21.080]   through subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.000]   And again he says, in writing to the Ephesians, chapter 4, verse 22, he says, "Look here,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.600]   I exhort you that you put off the old, be put off concerning the former conversation,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:40.320]   the old man, which is corrupt through the deceitful lusts."
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.560]   Hebrews 3, 13, "But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, 'Lest any of you
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.760]   be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.'"
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:03.120]   And then a final quotation, which puts it before us in a very staggering way.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   The Antichrist.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:10.440]   There have already been many Antichrists, there is yet another Antichrist as it were
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.940]   to come, a great Antichrist.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.940]   What about him?
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:21.480]   Well, even he whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:30.960]   wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:40.840]   That is his characteristic, deceivableness, all undeceivable, all deceivableness.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.560]   Are we not witnessing a great deal of this at the present time?
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.200]   I am not prophesying the end of the age, but I say we are witnessing it.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.480]   Never has it been more manifest than it is at the present time.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.720]   Well now then, where are the scriptural quotations?
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.440]   I could give you more.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.160]   The Bible is full of this.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   Sin is not only powerful, it is subtle, it is deceitful, it is clever, it eludes us,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.280]   it beguiles us, it misleads us.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:18.960]   My dear friends, it is because this is true of sin that all of us sin.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.400]   That is why there is so much sin in the world, that is why sin continues in the world.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:34.120]   Sin continues in spite of the knowledge that we have with regard to its effects and results.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.900]   You can read books showing you the evil effects of alcohol, yet men go on drinking it.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.040]   You can read books which will show you the evil effects of certain acts of immorality
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.960]   and uncleanness, yet men and women still go on doing it.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.400]   They have got the knowledge, but they still go on doing it.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.960]   Sin continues in spite of warnings.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:04.300]   Sin continues in spite of our experience of remorse and sorrow and pain and suffering
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.840]   after we have committed it.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.360]   We still continue sinning, though the whole record of history and of biography is there
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:20.200]   staring us in the face, showing us what sin leads to.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:26.160]   And as I have already said, in spite of all our morality teaching, in spite of all our
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.960]   psychology and the multiplication of all our institutes and agencies and education to produce
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:37.400]   better men and women and better living, in spite of it all, sin continues and sin is
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   increasing.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Why?
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.040]   There is only one answer, I say.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.160]   It is because it deceives us.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:55.280]   The commandment which was ordained unto life, I found to be unto death, why, well, because
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.200]   sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.480]   How did it do so?
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   How does it still do so?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:10.920]   How does sin use the law of God to deceive us?
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.440]   Let me try to answer the question.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   I am merely answering the question, how is it that the strength of sin is the law?
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   And I would classify the answers under the following headings.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:33.520]   One, sin deceives us into misusing the law.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   What do I mean?
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.640]   Well, I am taking up that statement of Paul in 1 Timothy 1.8, the law is good if a man
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.360]   uses it lawfully, yes, but sin comes in and it makes us use it unlawfully.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   How?
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.000]   Well, here is one, isn't it?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:58.400]   Sin persuades us that nothing matters but actions, desires, imaginations, so on, doesn't
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400]   count at all.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.760]   As long as I haven't done a thing, I am all right, I am free from sin.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:09.280]   Nothing matters except a man's actions, therefore as long as I am not committing those actions
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.400]   I am keeping the law, and I am therefore justifying myself in the sight of God.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.000]   Sin deceived me, says Paul, and it did in that way.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.680]   Paul was quite convinced, as we see in Philippians 3 and in other places, that he was really
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.440]   keeping the law.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.680]   As regards the righteousness of the law, blameless.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.680]   Sin deceived him.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.360]   He thought he was doing really well.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.800]   He was alive without the law once.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.360]   Sin had deceived him.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.240]   It had taken the commandment and had said, ah yes, well now the commandment means this,
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.960]   you see, you just do these things and don't do those, and you'll be all right with God.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.080]   And he believed it was all right, and he was doing it.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:50.200]   Not a word about coveting, of course.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:58.600]   And so, sin deceived him into misusing the law, but he does it in another way.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:06.920]   If we fall into sin, and the conscience begins to speak strongly and reminds us of the law
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   and its dictates, well then sin changes its tactics completely.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:23.600]   And it now comes to us and says, yes, that's quite right, you've sinned, you've failed.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:28.880]   And remember, the law of God is holy and just and good, and you've now broken it.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.480]   Well, you're absolutely hopeless.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.240]   And then, you see, the next step is this, well because I failed and I'm hopeless, there's
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.820]   no point in trying any further.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.500]   Having sinned once, I might as well sin again, I'll be no worse, I'm already hopeless, so
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.080]   I sin the second and the third and the tenth and the thousandth time.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.880]   That's how sin comes to us.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.480]   You've done it now, it's too late, you've spoiled your record, it doesn't matter what
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.000]   you do.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.520]   That's a misuse of the law.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:59.120]   Sin and its deceivableness says that to us, here's another.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   And this is one of the most terrible of all.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:12.040]   What is called antinomianism, which really means this, you see.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.320]   We have sinned and we are conscious of having broken the law.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320]   Ah, says sin, coming as an angel of light.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:25.120]   Of course, you have sinned and you have broken the law, but my dear sir, don't you realize
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.720]   that where sin abounded, grace hath much more abounded?
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.480]   It's all right, you've got nothing to worry about at all.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.620]   The more you are conscious of your sin, the more is grace.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.700]   And in a sense, the more you sin, the more grace operates in your case.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:46.040]   You're a saved man, you're under grace, it doesn't matter what you do.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.520]   Antinomianism, one of the most blighting curses that has ever afflicted the life of the church.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.000]   It troubled the early church, it has continued ever since.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.600]   Men taking the letter of the doctrine and the letter of the laws, if you will, and twisting
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   it to say that it doesn't matter what you do, because you're now under grace, shall
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.520]   we continue in sin?
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:11.800]   Because we are no longer under the law, but under grace, that's the deceitfulness of
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.480]   sin making you misuse and mishandle the law.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.800]   Nothing more terrible than that.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.600]   Well, take a second, Teddy.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:30.720]   Sin deceives us by creating within us also an antagonism to the law.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:37.240]   It makes us feel that God is against us, that's what the devil did with Eve, "Hath God said?"
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:44.100]   Yes, that's exactly what he does say, "He's against you."
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.680]   And the moment the law begins to speak, sin always comes in at that point.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.280]   It says, "Yes, that's exactly what he does say."
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:37:00.720]   That's because God is what he is, and he is against you, a stern, feelingless lawgiver.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.280]   But it doesn't stop at that.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:10.680]   Secondly, under this heading, sin makes us feel that the law is unreasonable in its demands
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.000]   upon us, that it's unjust.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.200]   That's why I gave out that hymn we've just been singing.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:26.640]   Always watch and vigil, always watch and prayer, narrow, cramped, prohibiting everything you
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.600]   like, urging things you don't like, the law of God it says is unjust, look at your law.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.920]   The devil here is an angel of light, says read your law, look at it, it's impossible.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:44.560]   It's unjust, it's unfair, it asks of us something that no man can ever do.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.360]   And so we hate it, and in our bitterness and hatred against it, when it tells us not to
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.000]   do a thing it creates the desire within us to do it.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.120]   So there's a second heading.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:04.280]   But it does it in a third way, and that is the way in which it deceives us about ourselves.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.560]   Sin in a very subtle way comes to us and falls upon us and praises us.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.600]   It makes us think very well and very highly of ourselves.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.480]   It says look here, why should you be held down under a law?
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.960]   As the devil put it to Eve, has God told you not to eat of that fruit?
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.480]   Why did he put that limit?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.680]   Why should you be deprived of that?
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.100]   Why should there be any limit upon what you do?
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.560]   It's an insult to your human nature, you know you were meant for freedom, you were
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.680]   not meant to bow down the knee to God or to law or anything else.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.520]   God's against you, he said, look here, said the devil, assert yourself, live your life.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.680]   You are able to look after yourself and to govern your own life.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:57.640]   And he still does that, our right to freedom, self-determination.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.200]   Man is autonomous, able to govern himself and his world, doesn't need anything outside
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   himself.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.320]   And when he does it, still the deceitfulness.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   And when he does it in the second way under this heading, and this is very common at the
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.240]   present time.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:23.760]   The law comes to us and prohibits certain things, yes, says the devil, yes, says sin.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.960]   And that is where again it's obviously against you, because what it's telling you is not
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.720]   to use the powers and the faculties that you've got within you.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.120]   You've got certain instincts, you've got certain impulses and drives within you, well
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.960]   obviously they're for some good and they're good in and of themselves, why don't you use
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.960]   them?
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.080]   You see, this is the popular teaching today.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.360]   They say you should never have a feeling of guilt, that's that old Victorianism and that
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.920]   old Biblicism, that's the Old Testament, they say you must never talk about sin, you must
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.320]   never have a feeling of guilt, that's violating your personality.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.800]   So the cult is self-expression.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.720]   Let your instincts govern you, do what you feel like doing, you've got these powers,
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.360]   but they're not to be repressed, that's what leads to unhealthiness.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   That's been their teaching, you'll find that many psychiatrists who treat their patients
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.080]   actually encourage them to do things which are prohibited in the Bible.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.200]   They say your trouble is your personality is repressed because you've been accepting
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.760]   the Biblical doctrine of sin, it's wrong, it's violating your nature, it's violating
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.520]   your own being and constitution.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:40.640]   Sin in its subtlety thus deceives people by praising them and by getting them to express
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.920]   themselves and their innate powers.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.320]   And that brings me to my last heading, which is this, the fourth heading.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.760]   Sin deceives us about sin itself.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.160]   First of all, it does it by making sin very attractive.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:07.400]   We read that Eve saw that the fruit was good to look upon, pleasant to look upon, and good
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.260]   to eat.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:13.640]   How extraordinary that God should prohibit the eating of such fruit, what a pleasant
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:19.520]   fruit it is, how perfectly formed, how marvelous its color and its proportions and its shape,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.000]   and no doubt the taste, if I only tasted it as the devil is saying, it would be wonderful
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.760]   if it was the finest fruit in the garden, and yet God prohibits it.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:39.400]   Sin deceived me and still deceives by making sin appear to be very attractive.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:43.840]   The Christian life looks very drab, doesn't it, and very narrow, and doesn't the world
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:44.840]   look wonderful?
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:51.520]   Look at the night lights of London and of Paris, look at the smiling thrones, the beautiful
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:56.240]   dresses, the bright eyes, and the wonderful appearance, of course you mustn't ask how
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.080]   it's produced, you don't talk about the drugs or the alcohol they've been taking, and all
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.920]   the heartbreak that after they go home one makes, no, no, but look at it, doesn't it
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:04.920]   seem wonderful?
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   London life.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.840]   A man comes up from the country and says, "Why, I haven't been living, this is life,
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.400]   it's marvelous, how attractive, how beautiful, how pleasant to look upon, how good it must
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.400]   be."
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.480]   And then, of course, you hear people praising it and talking about it and recommending it
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.880]   and saying, "This is real life," and the newspapers put it on the front page, "This
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.520]   is wonderful, this is really achievement in life, this is what the great and the famous
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   and the illustrious people rarely do, how wonderful."
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:45.720]   It all appears so attractive, so seductive, so interesting, so big, so noble, so free,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.040]   by contrast with this godly, biblical, Christian life, but secondly, it deceives us by discouraging
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.680]   in us any thoughts about consequences.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   It ridicules them.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.360]   Do you remember what the devil said to Eve?
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.640]   "Oh, God said, dearie, that if you ate of this fruit, you would certainly die."
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.600]   He said, "You will not certainly die."
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.720]   You hear the dogmatism, don't you?
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.080]   Here is the devil being reminded of what God had said.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:23.920]   He said to Eve, "You shall not surely die," and yet quite quickly they did die.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.640]   But the devil, with the utmost dogmatism and assurance, said, "You will not surely die."
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.840]   And Peter reminds us in his second epistle, chapter 3, that the godless are always saying
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.080]   the same thing, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.600]   You preachers are threatening retribution and punishment and disaster, but you've been
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.000]   doing it for centuries, and yet the world stands as it is always.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.600]   Where is the promise of his coming?"
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.960]   Sin deceives us about results and ends.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.040]   It assures us that nothing is going to happen.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.080]   It hates all punishment.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.360]   It hates the very idea of retribution.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.920]   Thank God, if I may again refer to the newspaper, we've had one little gleam of hope this
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   week.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.960]   The new Lord Chief Justice believes in punishment.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.300]   I say thank God for that.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.880]   He believes in physical punishment.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.760]   We need more and more of it.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.600]   You see, this notion that you must never punish, that prisons are simply there for reformatory
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.120]   purposes, is leading to the present chaos in prison life, in the courts, and in the
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.120]   whole of life.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:33.080]   It's this modern idea, you see, it's the seduction of sin, it's the deceivableness
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:39.200]   of sin, which discourages any idea of justice and righteousness and of punishment.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.480]   And of course, supremely any idea about hell.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.360]   Hell is just unthinkable.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.840]   No intelligent person ever talks about hell, we are told.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   No decent person talks about hell, it's ridiculed and dismissed.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.560]   It's incompatible with a God of love, and this is all sin speaking, you see.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.280]   Sin as an angel of light, sin talking about the love of God, anything to get you not to
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.920]   look at the consequences of your action, not to realize the end to which it's going to
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:13.040]   lead you, the death in which it's going to land you.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:18.080]   If you want to see it though at its acme, if you want to see the deceivableness and
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:24.680]   deceitfulness of sin at its very zenith, listen to what it says about the cross of Christ
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:31.520]   on Calvary's hill, and it does it, you see, from so-called Christian pulpits.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:37.960]   It says what is that, that is nothing but a great exhibition, a tableau, of the love
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   of God.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.560]   They say don't talk about substitutionary atonement, don't talk about the righteousness
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:48.840]   and the justice of God, don't say God was punishing his son in order that we might be
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.920]   free, that's introducing a false notion, that isn't God, don't talk about the wrath
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.960]   of God, don't talk about propitiation, we've been seeing all these terms, haven't we, earlier?
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.680]   Now that's the deceivableness and deceitfulness of sin talking, you see.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.400]   It's all love, there's no punishment, it's all right.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.880]   God's a God of love, live as you like, everybody'll go to heaven at the end, universalism, everybody's
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.640]   going to be saved, there's no division of mankind into the saved and the lost, and even
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:23.280]   out of the cross of Christ, the most glorious thing the world has ever seen, where God was
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:31.160]   showing his own eternal justice by even punishing his own son, whom he didn't spare from anything,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:38.960]   they take the glory out of it in order to deceive us about the real function of the
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:47.320]   law and the very character of God himself in his holiness and righteousness and justice.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.200]   That is how sin deceives us, and you see it does it, as Paul says, in Ephesians 4 and
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:47:04.880]   verse 17, it does it by darkening our understanding, having the understanding darkened, prevents
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:12.080]   our thinking clearly, misrepresents everything, gives us rose-tinted spectacles, perverts
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:17.920]   everything, changes everything, deceivableness, transforms everything, even the devil, as
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:23.680]   Paul says, can transform himself, as it were, into a veritable angel of light.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:35.320]   So sin deceived me, made use of the law to deceive me, and by it, slew me, killed me,
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:40.080]   took the life out of me, knocked me down, made me see I was utterly helpless and hopeless
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   and doomed and damned.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.040]   Sin always does that, as James says in his first chapter, verse 15, "Then when lust
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:59.880]   is conceived, it bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:06.600]   The commandment which was ordained unto life, I found to be unto death, for sin, taking
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:16.120]   occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it, the law of God, slew me, killed
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   me, left me dead and hopeless.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.520]   Amen.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:32.680]   O God, we humbly thank thee that thou dost give us this teaching.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:41.760]   We see, O God, not only how sinful we are, but what fools we are, how gullible we are,
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.560]   how blind we are.
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:50.240]   O Lord, we thank thee for thy Word and thy blessed Holy Spirit.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.300]   We pray thee that we all may see these things so clearly, that we shall hate sin with a
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:03.640]   holy hatred, and be as far away from it as we can.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:08.680]   Grant that we may so see these things, that we may be enabled by thy Spirit to open the
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:18.760]   eyes of others, to get rid of this fatal misunderstanding, to get rid of the darkness that covers the
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:24.960]   minds of men and women, so evidently in these evil days.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:32.520]   O God, we pray thee to give us such an understanding, that we shall by thy grace and power be able
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:38.120]   to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.560]   unto God.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.040]   Hear us, O Lord, and bless us and use us.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.720]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:57.520]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us, now, throughout the remainder
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:03.880]   of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and evermore.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   Amen.
