[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   We get a lot of questions about audiobooks sent in to the podcast.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720]   Here's today's question.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.720]   My name is Robert.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.760]   I am a transport truck driver in eastern Canada.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.040]   I tend to get the majority of my Bible "reading" done while listening to the Bible as an audiobook
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.780]   while I work and drive.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.660]   That includes listening to many of the episodes of this podcast also, so thank you.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.120]   But would you feel that listening to the Bible has the same intended effects as actually
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.320]   physically reading it with the eyes?
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.200]   Keeping in mind I can tell my phone to rewind a chapter if I want to hear it over again
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.440]   to keep things legal on the road.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.120]   Thank you for any advice that you can give me.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120]   Pastor John, what would you say to Robert?
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.280]   I think what I would like to do in response to Robert's question is to make 10 really
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:01.400]   brief bullet observations about the great benefits of listening to the Bible and a few
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.280]   observations about limitations of listening.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.900]   And in the process, I think I will answer Robert's question about whether listening
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.320]   has the same intended effects.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   Number one, it is a beautiful, supernatural, miraculous gift from God that Robert desires
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.440]   to listen to the Bible at all.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   While he drives his truck across eastern Canada, that's the first thing that comes to my
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.760]   mind, that he has any desire at all for God's Word is a glorious thing because millions
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.000]   of people, millions, care nothing for the Bible.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.060]   It's tragic.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.960]   It's heartbreaking.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   God has spoken.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.880]   God, the creator of the universe, has spoken and millions and millions of people pay no
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   attention.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.560]   Now, here's a man whose heart inclines to hear the Word of God, and that's glorious.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   Number two, people's brains are very different in the way we process what is read and what
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   is heard.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.740]   My children were very different in this regard.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.740]   Oh, my.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.780]   Some people can hear and remember almost everything that they hear, but they don't have anywhere
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.020]   near the same recall when they read, and vice versa.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.660]   So for that reason alone, I would need to say to Robert, "Well, depending on the way
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.980]   God made you, listening might bear even more fruit than reading."
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.140]   I don't know.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.140]   It could.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.540]   He asked if it's the same, and I said, "Well, it could be better."
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.700]   Number three, every time we listen to the Bible being read, we are listening not only
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   to the Bible, but to an interpretation of the Bible.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.420]   To read aloud is to interpret.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.620]   Your pace, your cadence, your emphasis, your pauses, your emotional tone, your softness,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.540]   your loudness, your pronunciation, all of these things communicate part of the author's
[00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.580]   intention in a way that the reader understands it and experiences it.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.880]   I say this as something that may be really good or a real problem.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.100]   If the interpretation is perceptive and penetrating and true and powerful, that's a benefit to
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.260]   the hearing listener.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.180]   If the interpretation is contrary to the author's intention in meaning or tone, it can be a
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.440]   great hindrance from profiting the way God intended us to profit when we read or hear
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   the Word.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.900]   We simply should be aware that when we listen, we are listening to an interpretation, and
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.740]   we should be discerning about that.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.740]   It may be right.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.220]   It may be wrong.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:10.860]   Number four, are you willing, Robert, or any of us, to pull over and stop driving in order
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:20.820]   to bring your full heart focus to bear on some word or thought or feeling that God has
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.940]   just used to deeply move you?
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.740]   I ask this because of how many people just the other day, another one, have told me over
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.580]   the years that at certain points in a sermon, they're driving, they were listening, and
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.860]   they were so moved that they had to pull over and deal with God and handle the emotions
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100]   without the distraction of driving.
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.220]   And I think everybody who listens to the Bible while driving or doing anything else should
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.960]   be willing to do that.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.060]   Number five, we should recognize that listening while driving necessarily means that the Bible
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.660]   is getting a partial focus of our fullest attention.
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.400]   We must think about driving.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.820]   We would be disobedient to God if we were to put ourselves or others at risk by not
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.220]   paying any attention to the road or the cars or the signs.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.940]   So this is a significant downside to absorbing all that God may have for us since the Bible
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.300]   is competing with the attention.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.820]   We must pay to the road.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.820]   This is not an evil.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.820]   It's not evil.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.540]   It's just a limitation of all that the Word might accomplish if it had our full and complete
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.540]   attention.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.100]   Number six, another limitation is that if we are reading, not driving, with the fullest
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.540]   attention, we can pause and look up a cross-reference that illuminates the word or phrase or idea
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.620]   that we are pondering.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.940]   I do that almost all the time when I'm reading the Bible.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.180]   We did an APJ recently in which we compared the new birth in Peter and the new birth in
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.980]   James, and I wouldn't have stumbled across that and taken the time to meditate on it
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.920]   if I'd only been driving a car when I heard that.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.940]   Number seven, another thing we can't do while driving is preserve something that we just
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.780]   thought or saw in the text.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.980]   Now not everybody does this anyway, but for me, I love either electronically, say an Evernote,
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.340]   or by jotting down with my pen an insight or a text, a thought that I got while reading
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.860]   some new light that I had.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.860]   You can't do that very easily while you're driving.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:43.140]   Number eight, because of everything I've said so far, I would suggest that listening to
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:51.060]   the Bible not be the only way we fellowship with God in the Word.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.160]   Listening is a great way to meet God.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.620]   It has its own advantages and benefits, but it also has limitations, so why not both?
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.500]   Number nine, in fact, here's something that I do that is a combination of reading and
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.780]   listening, doing both at the same time.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.620]   Sometimes if I'm especially tired and I still want to read several chapters of the Bible,
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.300]   yet my eyes and my brain are objecting, "We can't do this now.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:30.700]   We're too tired," I open my iPad to my Bible and I tell it to read to me.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:39.100]   I use the ESV audio Bible, and so I follow along with my own eyes and I listen while
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.580]   another person reads to me.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.780]   The reason I don't think I should do this all the time is because it does not take as
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:54.940]   much engagement with my mind when I let somebody else read the words to me.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:02.220]   I think that greater engagement when I read it myself, even perhaps out loud, is more
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.060]   fruitful than when somebody else reads it to me.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:13.700]   Yes, there are times when it seems to me really helpful to have some other person, just audio
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.020]   book read to me.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:23.380]   Finally, so, Robert, press on with your listening by all means in the truck.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:29.620]   May God fill you with a spirit of wisdom and of revelation like Paul prays as you listen
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:37.980]   and drive, and may he open the eyes of your heart to see glorious things in his Word.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.380]   That's our goal, whether we're reading or listening to the Bible.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:52.420]   We want to see him more clearly and love him more dearly and follow him more nearly, as
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:00.740]   the song says, and the way he has appointed for that to happen is by the Word of God.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.420]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Robert.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.460]   A shout out to truck drivers listening to the podcast right now.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.620]   And speaking of listeners of the podcast, I just got a note from one of our dearest,
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.340]   dearest, most precious podcast listeners in the whole world, a woman whose presence in
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.940]   a room just makes the room shine with the presence of Jesus.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.940]   She's a giant, one of my heroes of the faith.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.540]   Her name is Johnny Erickson-Totta, and Johnny is a regular listener to APJ, which is, that's
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.940]   so humbling, such a huge honor for us to have her as a listener.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.740]   And she wrote a little thank you note to us recently, and she said this, I wanted to share
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:41.340]   this little part, quote, "As a quadriplegic, I am able to lie in bed at night and easily
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.580]   navigate the app using Siri voice control on my iPhone.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.300]   Although I do not have use of my hands, I nevertheless have the freedom to delve as
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.940]   far back into APJ as I'd like, with each episode filling my mind with great Bible truths, always
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.420]   preparing my heart to be instructed in the night.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.660]   What a great way to end each evening."
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.660]   End quote.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.460]   That's incredible to read.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.820]   Those lines just hit me.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.860]   The power of audio content, and Lord, thank you for making it possible for us to record
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.300]   and share verbal content like this podcast.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.380]   Robert's question and his situation just reminded me of Johnny as well.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.020]   It's incredible to have all of you along listening.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:25.380]   So thank you for listening in, whatever your situation in life, I'm glad to have you along.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.660]   Well MLK Day is Monday, and we're going to look at Martin Luther King Jr., the preacher,
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.340]   and we're going to look at his partner in the cause, another preacher.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.220]   It's an interesting episode coming up on Monday, the story of two preachers, two friends.
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.220]   I am Tony Reinke.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.420]   No matter what you are doing right now as you listen, thank you for joining us today,
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.620]   and we'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.140]   Thanks for listening.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   Thanks for listening.
