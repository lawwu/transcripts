[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.280]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I want to talk to you about your child's
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.040]   education. And I want to ask you this question, are you getting your money's worth
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:36.400]   and your child's time's worth from their education? I'm recording this show in April of 2018 and we
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.920]   are soon to be arriving at the end of the normal academic year for students in the United States
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.760]   of America. At the end of the academic year, we have an important opportunity to stop and reflect
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.240]   upon the past year and ask ourselves, how are we doing? I really think it's important to regularly
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.480]   schedule time for introspection and analysis. At the end of the calendar year, we should sit down
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.320]   and analyze how did the last year go? Or at your birthday, you should sit down and analyze how did
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.120]   the last year go in your life? Or perhaps when celebrating your anniversary, you should sit down
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.360]   and speak with your spouse and ask each other, how did the last year go in our marriage?
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.320]   And with regard to education, we should always stop near the end of the academic year
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:35.680]   and analyze and say, how are we doing? How did it go? Are we on track or do we need to change
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.640]   course? It's important to do this while the memories are fresh, while you're still in the
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.560]   thick of it, not at the end of summer vacation when everything has faded into the oblivion of
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.240]   the past. And so I want to ask you that question today. How are you doing or how are your children
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   doing? This is extremely important and I'm engaging today in a form of political activism,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.280]   but I'm seeking to connect it very clearly to your finances. Elsewhere in the Radical
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   Personal Finance archives, I've spoken extensively about the silliness that has gripped modern
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.920]   financial planning, wherein we spend all of our time and attention focused on saving for college
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.360]   and treating it merely as a financial exercise rather than actually thinking about the overall
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.400]   comprehensive structure of our children's education and seeking to invest our dollars
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.800]   where they do the most good. I've recorded an episode of Radical Personal Finance called
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.160]   "Why This Financial Advisor Refuses to Save for His Child's College." Yes, that's me. I'm the
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   financial advisor and I presented a list of arguments in that show, but perhaps the most
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.000]   significant was the dollars that you save for your child's college are the least effective dollars.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   The most effective dollars are the dollars that you spend early in your child's life.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.920]   Also, the dollars that you save for your child's college are the dollars that are the easiest for
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:15.280]   you or your child to replace later on, whereas the most effective dollars now, while your children are
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.480]   young, those are the dollars that can't really be replaced. There aren't a lot of government grants.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.640]   There aren't a lot of scholarships. There aren't a lot of student loans available.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:50.160]   The only thing that is available at a low cost is government schooling.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.440]   Here in Florida where I live, the government is rolling out a whole new program to try to get
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:14.640]   your three-year-old enrolled in free schooling. The question would be, is that a good deal?
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:26.160]   Is it a good deal for you to take the free option of government schooling for your child?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.800]   Well, let's talk about it. I want to assume that your child is currently enrolled in the
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.320]   government schools. Here would be a question. How many hours did your child spend in school
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.960]   this last year? How much money did that cost you, and are you getting your money's worth?
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.440]   I'll start first with the hours. According to the National Center for Education Statistics,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.200]   if we look at a national average across the United States of America, the national average
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   for the total amount of time spent in the classroom is 6.64 hours per day per student
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:11.040]   over the total of 180 days of instruction. It's about six and a half hours a day for 180 days.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.480]   Multiply 6.64 hours per day times 180 days, and you wind up with 1,195 hours of total classroom
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:29.280]   time that your child has enjoyed, I mean, been involved in over the last year.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.480]   Now, for the sake of some simple verbal math that's optimized for podcast delivery,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.000]   I want to smooth these numbers just a little bit. Let's say that we start with about six and a half
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.680]   hours a day plus about 45 minutes or so getting to the school classroom and away from the school
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.200]   classroom. Let's average that out to about eight hours per day. Eight hours per day that your child
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.120]   is involved in the government school. Well, multiply eight hours per day times 180 days,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   and you wind up with 1,440 hours. Now, depending on other activities, that number may be higher
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.880]   or lower. Your child may be involved in extracurricular activities, which would add more
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.120]   time. Perhaps your child does homework. If you added one hour of homework per day, that would
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.000]   wind up being about nine hours per day. If we multiplied nine hours per day times 180 days,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   we'd wind up with 1,620 hours of total time. Let's just split the difference, and for the sake of
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   verbal math, assume 1,500 hours of time from your child's life that has been consumed in their
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   schooling this past academic year. Now, perhaps you have a hard time, like I do, of conceiving
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   of 1,500 hours. That's not a unit that works well in the human brain. We don't really have a reference
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.360]   point for that. So, let's convert it into a reference point that we do have easily available
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   to us, that of a 40-hour workweek. If you divide 1,500 hours into a 40-hour workweek, that means
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:13.280]   that your child has used 37.5 40-hour workweeks of their time involved in their schooling this
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.520]   last year. Or, if we divide it into an absolute daily number of 365 days per year, that comes out
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:31.360]   to 4.11 hours per day. So, the way that you can envision your child's time that has been involved
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.040]   in schooling is to think of them waking up each and every day, 365 days per year, no holidays,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.520]   no weekends, no exceptions, and using 4.11 hours of their day from, let's just say, 8 a.m. to 12
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   p.m. every single day of the year involved in schooling. That's the time that was involved.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.400]   Now, what about the money? How much money was spent on your child's schooling this last year?
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.800]   Well, you could look at how much money you spent on your child's schooling, but unfortunately,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   that's an impossible number to calculate because we spread this burden out over people who have
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.040]   children and don't have children because, theoretically, it's good for society.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   Well, according to the, again, the National Center for Education Statistics,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.520]   we spend, on average, across the United States of America, about $12,509 per year per student.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:34.080]   Comes out to about $634 billion per year, or a total of $12,509 per government school student.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   Ranges a little bit each year, but it stays right in that number, about $12,500.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:50.720]   So, divide the $12,509 per student into the 6.64 hours per day for 180 days,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:56.640]   and you wind up with an hourly cost per student of $10.47 per hour of instruction.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.560]   For every single student in the government school, with the time that they're in the class,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.640]   it comes out to $10.47 per hour. Or if we were to use our 1,500-hour number,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.760]   we'd wind up with, which includes a little bit of travel time and perhaps some homework time,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.600]   et cetera. It comes out to an hourly cost of $8.34 per hour. So, my question to you is this.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:28.560]   Are you getting your money's worth? Is your child getting our money's worth?
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:37.840]   Here at the end of the academic year, I want you to stop and take a very careful look at your child's
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:48.720]   growth over the past year, and rate it and assess it. How has their intellectual growth
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.080]   been? How would you rate it? How about their personal growth? How would you rate that?
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:04.080]   How about their character development, the strength of their character, the virtues they've developed?
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:13.120]   How's it going? Tell me about their skills. What skills have they learned and developed
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.360]   and applied that will be useful to them next year and the next year and a decade from now
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:27.280]   and 30 years from now? How are they doing? What have they learned? Tell me about what they've
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:34.720]   learned in the last year. If you were to sit down and take a marker from one year ago,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.480]   what they knew one year ago and what they know today, what have they learned? What knowledge
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.880]   have they've acquired? What new skills have they developed and learned how to do? What have they
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:54.720]   learned how to do? Are they better at something? If so, what is it? Are you getting your money's
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:04.800]   worth? I challenge you to accurately complete this exercise. Now, ideally, of course, you would do it
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.920]   with your child. It'll be hard for your four-year-old to lay out what they've learned. You
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.640]   can assess that a little bit more. It'll be a little bit harder for you to lay out what your
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.680]   16-year-old has learned, but it'll be more important for them to be able to do that for
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.920]   themselves. Tell me about their progress and are you getting your money's worth?
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:42.560]   Now, in general, I would say most listeners, if you take an accurate analysis of the total time
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.800]   of your child's life that has been consumed to produce those results that you're charting,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.680]   and you compared it towards the personal ability that your child possesses,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.640]   I think you're getting shortchanged. I think you're getting a bad deal
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:08.320]   because that 1,500-hour number is a huge number,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.000]   and I want you to carefully think about that number as you consider the results.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.920]   My guess would be that your child does have some results,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:24.560]   but are they getting the results that they deserve to get? Are they getting the results
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:33.520]   that you want them to get from those 37-and-a-half, 40-hour work weeks that have been involved? From
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.920]   that four hours per day every single day of the year that they have invested into their activities
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:52.400]   there? Are you getting a good return on the investment of time? For a tiny handful of people,
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:13:02.000]   the answer will be yes, but for the vast, vast majority, the answer is a clear and unequivocal
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:14.080]   no. So, I want to encourage you to consider withdrawing your child from the government school
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:24.240]   and ending the madness of them wasting their time, their precious time, these most valuable hours
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:35.200]   of their life. Stop the madness of them wasting the majority of this valuable time
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:47.680]   for mediocre results. Now, in public, I lobby continuously for what I call "mere withdrawal"
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.360]   from government schools. What I mean by that is I don't advocate for any particular alternative.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.240]   I don't claim, for example, that Montessori or classical education or Jeffersonian education or
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.880]   Charlotte Mason or the Prussian model, I don't claim that any one specific of these ideologies
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:13.600]   is superior. I don't advocate for private schools versus home schools. I don't say what you should
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.400]   do. These certainly are worthy debates and I engage in them privately, but I don't take a
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.080]   public advocacy position on this. After all, think about this. How could I possibly know
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:35.600]   what's right for you and your child and your family? How could I possibly know those unique
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:43.200]   circumstances that you face, those unique needs that you have in your family? How could I possibly
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.920]   know what unique characteristics and skills and abilities and interests your children have?
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.960]   How could I possibly lay out for you what you should do without actually sitting down
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.320]   with you and your spouse and your children and thinking about what your goals are?
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.240]   How could I possibly know the moral framework that your family holds,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.000]   the things that are important to you, the things that you've decided you're going to
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.720]   teach your children? How could I possibly know the heroes that your family has?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.680]   How could I possibly know the things that your family stands for? How could I dictate to you
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.760]   what you should do in your family
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:38.480]   unless I asked you first what you wanted to accomplish,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:47.760]   unless I first got to know you and your children and started to understand your values and your
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.880]   your values and your goals, your aspirations, your family dynamics?
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:01.680]   How could I tell you what's right for you without knowing anything about you?
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:13.440]   Obviously, I couldn't possibly do that. And if you'll think about those questions I just asked,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   my hope is that you'll see why I unreservedly lobby for you to withdraw your child from government
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:38.320]   schools while also, without reservation, admitting that I don't know what's right for you and your
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:47.440]   family. Those two positions are in perfect harmony if you think about it.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.080]   To help you consider some of these ideas, I thought it would be fun for me to read to you an
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:02.560]   excerpt from one of my favorite novels, a novel that I really have enjoyed. And I enjoy it because
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.240]   it's not just a story, but it's a useful story that's wrapped up with a whole lot of interesting,
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.600]   thought-provoking ideas. The novel is called Moulin la Baye by an author who goes by the
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.320]   pen name Boston Tea Party. His name is Kenneth W. Royce. And he wrote this novel years ago. It's
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.800]   called, again, Moulin la Baye, which is obviously an illusion, you know, the illusion back to
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:33.680]   Thermopylae and come and take him. But it's basically a political novel that discusses
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:43.120]   the idea of peaceful secession of a free state from the larger tyrannical United States. And it
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:49.440]   was published back in, for the first time, in 1997. It's very old, updated and printed in January
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.720]   2004, was the last printing that I'm aware of. So it's very old, but it's a very carefully crafted
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:02.480]   novel that discusses a peaceful path of secession based upon individuals simply making individual
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:09.440]   choices for their lives. I will – I love the novel. It's really good. It's not the – it's
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   not as grippingly written as is a, you know, a Tom Clancy thriller, but it's very well written and
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.640]   much better written than many other of this type of genre that I have consumed. But it's packed full
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   of interesting ideas. And in this novel, the author publishes what – makes up what is published as
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   a so-called interview in Playboy magazine, an interview with the governor of Wyoming.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.000]   Now, this is coming after a decade and a half of a progression of what's called the Wyoming Free
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.200]   State Project, which was a competitor to the New Hampshire Free State Project. The – and it was –
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.600]   the book was written as essentially an outline, a plan for how liberty-minded individuals could
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.240]   proceed forward in a peaceful way to establish their own liberty-focused place to live. And so
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:08.720]   in the context of this novel, the author contrives this interview with a Playboy magazine reporter,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.440]   journalist, and the governor of Wyoming. This interview is, again, I emphasize, contrived.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.960]   However, it is well done in terms of its ability to share some of these ideas. And I thought it
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.560]   would be one of the most – a very persuasive way for me to convey to you some things for you to
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:34.640]   think about as you do this analysis so you can decide what's right for you and your family.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.960]   I'm going to read it in the context of the narrative. Hopefully, you understand enough
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:45.120]   about the narrative of the novel to have an idea about the positioning of this interview within
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:51.760]   the novel. But the interview is fact-based and it's very much focused on these issues that I'm
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:59.440]   describing to you. Playboy interview James Preston, a second candid conversation with Wyoming's Laissez-Faire
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:06.560]   Party governor. Introductory note, James Preston's administration, with the enthusiastic support – let
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.960]   me pause for a moment on the introductory note, one more detail that you need – after a series of
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:18.160]   other liberty-oriented political moves wherein the voters of the state of Wyoming, after many years
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:27.360]   of focus, have systematically pulled apart and canceled many extant laws to move in the direction
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.440]   of liberty, then there is a constitutional amendment that is being proposed to the citizens
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.920]   of Wyoming to completely abolish state-run education and to disconnect the education and
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:48.320]   the state and to cancel any governmental involvement with schooling. And so in the
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.760]   context of that plotline, this interview appears. James Preston's administration, with the
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.640]   enthusiastic support of the Wyoming legislature, proposes to divest the government of public
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.840]   education and turn it completely over to local private concerns. Senator Schumer went so far
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:12.160]   as to call his goal "cannon fire on Fort Sumter." Even though 57% of Wyoming voters favored the
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.200]   privatization of education in a recent constitutional amendment election, several lawsuits have been
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.320]   filed in federal court to prevent it. Plaintiffs include the NEA, AFT, and other teachers unions,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.600]   as well as a consortium of Wyoming parents. Two years following our first interview, we spoke
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:34.960]   with Governor James Preston about his "separation of education and state." Governor Preston,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.440]   Playboy is very pleased to have you back for a second interview. Thank you, Tom. I certainly
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.520]   enjoyed the first one. Wyoming is the first state ever to propose dismantling its public education
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:52.400]   system. Much of the country seems horrified by this. Horrified, eh? Perhaps they wouldn't be
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.920]   so shocked if they'd ask themselves why any government on these shores is involved in education
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:03.680]   in the first place. If one lives with a malignant tumor long enough, it acquires the status of a
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.120]   vital organ. But to address your question, education is a matter of parental, not state,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.480]   concern. We in Wyoming are reclaiming our right to eliminate the forcible government indoctrination
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.040]   of our children. The special election will be held in August, and we are confident that the
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.200]   proposed constitutional amendments will be ratified. The shrieking from the National
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:28.240]   Education Association about this is just amazing. They apparently believe that education is not
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.480]   possible without government schools. Well, they're half right, at least. How so? Government
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:41.600]   education does require government schools. You have been consistently and intensely critical of
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:48.240]   public schools, calling them "training camps for future slaves." How can you justify that claim
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.920]   when this country still enjoys the greatest amount of personal freedom in the world?
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.520]   First of all, to compare our level of freedom to that of other countries is not accurate,
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.520]   or even helpful. As I've long been fond of saying, America is merely the healthiest patient in the
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.760]   cancer ward. The comparison should be made against, one, the theoretical ideal, and two,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.720]   against the greater freedom America once had until the 1920s. To compare our freedom to the
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.640]   rest of the world only serves to slyly misdirect us from the freedom we ourselves have already lost.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.520]   It's a way of shrinking the yardstick of measurement. Contrasted to other nations,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.960]   sure, we're still six feet tall. However, contrasted to ourself, which is the only
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.720]   proper standard in both the philosophic and historic senses, we have become a midget.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   And I am convinced that the government indoctrination of our schoolchildren
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.280]   has been largely to blame for this unnecessary decline. Really? How so?
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:54.480]   Well, because it was the stated and published goals of the public educators in the early 19th
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   century. Their object was not quality education, but docile citizens. Not independent thought,
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.800]   but conformity. Intellectuals of every era have distrusted the common man, likening him to a
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:15.200]   coarse beast of burden which must be kept under yoke. They greatly feared popular uprisings.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.480]   Shea's Rebellion in 1786 Massachusetts, which sparked the Annapolis and Philadelphia
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.880]   constitutional conventions, was still fresh on Bostonians' minds in 1818, where the first public
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.680]   school movement began in America. Then many educators traveled to Prussia to learn their
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:39.120]   methods. Why Prussia? Gatto's fine book, Dumbing Us Down, outlined the whole sordid story.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.480]   When Napoleon trounced Prussia in 1806 at the Battle of Jena, intellectuals decided that the
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.280]   reason for their defeat was a failure of the troops versus their commanders. They concluded
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.440]   that Prussian soldiers were too independent and thought too much for themselves. As if soldiers
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:01.520]   would fall into philosophical debates over Kant in the field. Pretty much. No commander once
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   an army of deeply contemplative troops. This reminds me of a story about Henry Kissinger.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.040]   He was once asked if he feared assassination. He thought for a moment and replied, "No,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.320]   because only an intellectual would ever choose me." And even then he couldn't decide to pull
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.360]   the trigger. But seriously, the Prussian intellectuals believed that their citizens
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.520]   simply were not obedient enough and hesitated to fire on the enemy. The US army noticed the
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.880]   same thing during World War II when researchers discovered that only 20% of American soldiers
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:42.080]   would fire on an exposed enemy. The army addressed this and by the Korean War, some 55% of soldiers
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.840]   would fire to kill. By Vietnam, it was 90%. With the conditioning from violent films,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.080]   video games, and military simulators, the percentage today is about 100%.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.480]   This has spilled over into our police, who have donned an alarmingly military guise.
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.400]   Federal law enforcement is now predominantly composed of agents with little on-site conscience.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:10.720]   For example, a very high percentage of FBI agents for the past 50 years have been Mormons and/or
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:17.200]   ex-Marines. Why is that? Because their members are naturally "yes, sir" type of folks,
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.520]   which explains why the FBI wants them. They are what Eric Hoffer calls "true believers." They
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   will obey even the most ghastly orders if there is a sufficient gloss of "God" and "country."
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.920]   As an ex-Marine myself, I got only as far as "Captain" since everybody knows that there was
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.280]   only so much crap I'd take. Anyway, the Prussians' goal of education was to create pliable students
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.960]   to be molded into compliant citizens, meaning those who work and fight at the behest of the
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.240]   government and never have to decide to pull the trigger. This was accomplished by purposely
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.400]   not training the students how to think. How did Prussian schools teach students not to think?
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:05.120]   Teaching not to think sounds like an oxymoron. Mustn't education, any education, awaken minds
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:14.160]   and activate the thought process? No, not at all. Teaching by rote, a series of "disconnected facts,"
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:20.560]   is not the same as teaching one to actually think. What the Prussians did was unequivocally
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:27.280]   premeditated. They rearranged their school system into three tiers as a very broad pyramid.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:36.000]   About 1% of students were taught to think in the "académie." These would be the future leaders,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.360]   doctors, lawyers, business chairmen, etc. About 5% were somewhat taught to think in the "réel
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:49.600]   julen." They would become the middle managers and politicians. Some mental faculty was required,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:57.280]   but not too much. The rest, 94% of students, were left in the "volkskullen" to learn harmony,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:04.240]   obedience, and docility. Cooks, mechanics, laborers, and most importantly, soldiers.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:11.120]   Reading was very much discouraged as it tended to provoke dissent amongst the proletariat.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   It still does. How were these Prussian "volkskullen" different? Their most telling trait
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   was severe regimentation. The very word "kindergarten" means "garden of children."
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.960]   Think about that. The Prussian educators not only had to get their indoctrinating paws on children
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.040]   as young as four years old, but they had the nerve to refer to them with a horticultural analogy.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.840]   "Sorry, Ing, you're not a unique person. You're just one plant in the garden.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.200]   Children are not a bunch of plants to be grown and harvested."
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:56.160]   I never thought of it quite like that, but the analogy is inherently dehumanizing.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:03.040]   Absolutely. The battle for the metaphor is the most important, as it pre-structures thought,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.840]   and thus action. In fact, we could continue their farming analogy even further.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:14.160]   The testing which placed students in their "proper tier" of schooling were like threshers
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.520]   separating the "academie" wheat from the "volkskullen" chaff. Yes, that follows.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:28.000]   So how were things taught in the "volkskullen"? They took the grand subject of life and chopped
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.560]   it up into little subsets. Instead of illuminating the mysteries of living as a holistic system,
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:42.480]   as it most certainly is, they cleaved mathematics from music, philosophy from language, and so on.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:49.200]   They taught the pixels, but not the picture formed by the pixels. In doing so,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:56.160]   they created adults who could not see. Could you elaborate on that? Of course.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:03.760]   Thinking really is all about seeing. Our brains are wired to receive information mostly by sight,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   about 80%. In fact, PET scans of the brain have proven that visualizing an object stimulates the
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.320]   same area of the brain as actually seeing the object. The eye is merely the camera for the
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:25.040]   recording tape of the brain. We only know what we have seen. That's why dreams often seem so real.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   The taped version is just as vivid to the mind as the live version. Physiologically,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.400]   there's almost no difference. That's why sports trainers stress the repetitive visualization of
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:46.080]   movement, constant mental rehearsals. It actually imprints athletic memory, as the mind cannot
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:53.440]   distinguish between mental versus physical rehearsal. It's no coincidence that when one
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:31:02.160]   has a eureka moment, one says, "Oh, I see." What Prussian Vokstulen did was intentionally prevent
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   the child from ever opening its mind's eye. The goal was to keep the people at large mentally
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:15.760]   blind. Sure, the masses stumble about fairly well in the pretense of seeing, just as a blind person
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:23.280]   with a cane can walk across town. But make no mistake, they are stumbling about in the dark
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:32.240]   by feel. By segregating subjects and teaching them out of order, the mind's eye is never trained to
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.160]   see the big picture. Vision, I tell you, is the key to nearly everything in life.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:48.080]   If you can't see it, you can't know it or do it. I understand your point, but I'm not convinced that
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:54.560]   merely teaching by subject necessarily stunts mental growth. Okay, let's take mathematics,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.240]   for example. It is without dispute that the USA scores lowest in math amongst the Western world.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:07.680]   I recall we may have beaten Portugal once, but not by much. The most exciting thing about math
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.920]   is not the numbers, but the theory. Mathematics is a way of understanding particular kinds of
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   relationships. Numbers are simply the alphabet of expression. For example, what is 7 times 19?
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:32.240]   It's 133. Now, did I multiply 7 times 10, which is 70, and then 7 times 9, adding the 63 to the 70?
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:41.760]   No, I took a shortcut. Why go through all of that when 7 times 20 is 140 and 7 times 19 is merely
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:50.400]   140 minus 7? But kids aren't being taught to take shortcuts because they can't see the numerical
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.040]   landscape and recognize shortcuts when they exist. They're taught to literally go by the numbers,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:05.520]   like a blind man tapping with his cane. What is not seen is not understood. Do you see?
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:15.360]   Yes, I do, but does your analogy hold for higher mathematics? Well, if we know that A has a
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:23.280]   specific relation to C, and that A also has a specific relation to B, then we can figure out
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:31.920]   what B is to C. That's algebra, to use what you know to learn what you don't. Calculus is even
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.600]   more fascinating because it explains relationships at an even deeper level. Physics, especially
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.360]   quantum physics, gets really hairy. Either life has the possibility for many states and is forced
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.960]   by observation to be in one particular state, or life is many worlds in simultaneous coexistence,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.800]   which appear to us as a single state. Whichever it is, the math of quantum physics contends that
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:04.000]   life is much more surreal and inexplicable than imagined under Newtonian physics. But instead of
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   firing up students about the marvel of math, teachers immediately bog them down in quadratic
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.800]   equations and log tables. It's like trying to teach dancing by steps but without the rhythm.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.480]   My point is this. Mathematics are merely one tool for understanding and enjoying life.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.360]   Art is another. So is science, music, etc. The mind, the awakened mind,
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:37.280]   uses all of these rays of light in its lens to see, to understand. The more rays of light,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:43.600]   the more chromatic your picture. This was the avowed purpose of the long lost classical education.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.680]   On a related note, it constantly amazes me how much of life can be grasped by analogy.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.200]   We learn about life analogously through nature, through human relationships, and through science.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.440]   It's all grist for the mill. So back to the Prussian system of education.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.160]   Yes, the Volksschulen. They broke up life into pieces. By dividing life, they conquered free
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.600]   inquisition. They conquered thought itself. Then they broke up the pieces into units,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:18.320]   and units into small blocks of class time lasting 50 minutes. First, regiment the entire student
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:25.680]   body by artificial age groups. No more one room schoolhouse. This separates older students from
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:32.880]   younger ones, which reduces socialization and nullifies any generational continuity. I mean,
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:40.160]   do you work or vacation solely with 34 year olds? It's ridiculous, but accepted without a thought in
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.440]   government schools. You're right. Nowhere else are you placed in a strict age group.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.680]   If you really dwell on it, it seems quite odd. I don't think that we even remotely understand the
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.840]   sociological damage it's done. So children are clumped together by age, their first experience
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.960]   of being part of a collective. Then get them accustomed to moving by a series of ringing
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:08.560]   bells. The bell commands when to sit down and stay, when to stand up and leave, when to eat,
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   when to play, and when to go home. Pavlov's bell, day in and day out for 12 years. Class starts and
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:23.360]   then ends 50 minutes later. Who can possibly learn anything during these cruel and artificial blocks
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.480]   of time? Just when you've become interested in a lesson, it's time to rush off with the herd to the
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:35.520]   next class. The whole arrangement is little more than moving cattle from field to field.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:41.600]   Another analogy. No problem. Playboy interviews are known for free-form digressions.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   Yes, well, I'll try not to abuse the privilege. So what were we talking about? Anyway, the New
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   England educators of the 19th century studied Prussian education and imported it to America.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:02.480]   Massachusetts passed the first compulsory attendance law in 1852. Parents who resisted
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.320]   had their children taken from them by the state militia. Barnstable on Cape Cod held out until
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:15.520]   the 1880s. By 1900, compulsory attendance laws were universal. It is vital to understand that
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:26.560]   none of this was necessary, as basic literacy was 98% before government schools, after which
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:35.440]   it never exceeded 91%. Just as in Prussia, reading was discouraged. After all, illiteracy
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:42.640]   is the first and the most effective form of censorship. Basic literacy had to be maintained
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.960]   until the advent of auditory mass propaganda, the common household radio of the 1930s. After the
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:56.080]   1950s, TV did all the speaking, and literacy was thereafter shot to hell. Anyway, the school year
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:01.200]   grew longer and longer, from 12 weeks to 10 months. When I was a child, we weren't in school
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.480]   after Memorial Day or before Labor Day. We'll probably see it grow to 11 months if the current
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.240]   bill in Congress passes. As if 10 months of crappy schooling isn't enough, the state has
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.720]   increasingly asserted that your child belongs to them, not to you. This is undiluted communist and
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:24.160]   Nazi doctrine. Tell us something about your own education. Did you go to public or private schools?
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:30.560]   I went to both, about 50/50. By law, the Prussian model still serves as the basis for our schools
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.640]   today, including most of the private ones if they want to receive government money.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   Even though my private education was engineered on Prussian lines, it was nonetheless at least
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   twice the quality as the government schools I attended. I give credit to several particular
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:51.840]   teachers and professors of mine who conscientiously taught me how to think. Fortunately, they appeared
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:58.400]   in a rather relay form, and I was not long without my next mentor. So whatever auspicious mental
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.800]   faculty I am accused to possess, I owe to these dedicated men and women, most of whom I encountered
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:10.400]   in private schools. And because of the perception and finances of my parents, I was not only allowed
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:17.680]   to, but encouraged to attend private school. If your private education was nonetheless
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.880]   structured along the Prussian model, and you survived, then how can the same structure really
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.600]   be so detrimental for public school children? I mean, you don't seem visibly harmed by your
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:34.080]   education. Well, I survived in spite of the system, not because of it. Actually, my mother
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.960]   had homeschooled me before kindergarten, and I already knew how to read at a second grade level.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:44.720]   Both of my parents were avid readers, which sort of rubbed off on me. My kindergarten teacher in
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.560]   private school, by the way, was superb, almost Montessorian. I now see what a difference she
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:55.840]   made. Had I gone exclusively to government schools, I might not have made it. Too many children don't.
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:02.720]   What do you mean, "Too many children don't"? Think about it, Tom. You march off to school with
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:09.600]   your chronological peers, with whom you'll graduate twelve years later. Class of 2018 is merely
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:16.800]   Orwellian Newspeak for "Heard of 2018." If you fail to keep up to the statistical mean,
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.960]   you get sent to remedial or special ed classes. You open your books when you're told, you eat when
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.920]   you're told, you pee when you're told, you go home when you're told. You do everything as a group
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.360]   and nothing as an individual. You even shower together, which is calculated to strip away a
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.960]   child's sense of self and dignity. Even in seventh grade, I thought it was weird. I mean, where else
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:46.240]   is one forced to bathe in public? Well, in the military, of course. Right, that other bastion
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.000]   of individualism. So are you seeing the bigger picture here, Tom? Government schools are kiddie
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.240]   boot camps designed by one of the most militaristic races in modern history. The parallels are
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.680]   profound. Can you imagine army basic training without the preconditioning of grade school?
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   Wouldn't work. Draftees would be too independent. So you've got to sand them down while they're
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.960]   schoolchildren. You go through metal detectors at the door and suffer obtrusive searches by the
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.920]   dog-handling drug cops. You're encouraged to snitch on your fellow students as well as on
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.640]   your own family. Doodle a third grade picture of a rifle-toting soldier or fighter plane with
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:29.760]   missiles and you'll get expelled for violent tendencies. Same thing if you defend yourself
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:36.480]   against the schoolyard bully. Fail to intimately describe your dreams, your fears, your aspirations,
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.080]   and they'll call in the school shrink. Become bored or fidgety in class, and who wouldn't?
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:48.160]   And you're sent to Nurse Ritalin or Dr. Prozac. So what have you learned after 12 years? That there
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.920]   is no such thing as personal privacy and that the Bill of Rights died long ago. That private property
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:00.080]   is whatever the authorities allow. You've learned to go with the flow and not rock the boat and that
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.680]   you can't fight city hall. You've learned that the needs of the many take precedence over the needs
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.920]   of the few or the one. You've learned to shut up and do what you're told. And if you encounter
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:18.160]   somebody who hasn't learned these things, you turn him in for suspicious or anti-social behavior.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:24.560]   In short, you have learned to be a slave within a police state. Oh, come on now,
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:31.200]   slave within a police state? Isn't that tilting at hyperbole? I'll let you answer that yourself.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:39.600]   So you believe that we do have personal privacy? That the Bill of Rights is in effect? That your
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:46.000]   private property is off limits to bureaucrats? That you have a right to the fruits of your own
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.880]   labor and take home 100% of your paycheck? That your individual opinion is heard and respected by
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:59.920]   the high-thinking throng? That you actually have a say in national government? That you can speak
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:07.040]   your mind without fear of retribution? That nobody will shun you as an extremist or turn you in as a
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:14.160]   terrorist? That you're a free man in a free country? Do you actually believe any of that?
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:18.240]   And if you don't, then how can I be tilting at hyperbole?
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:26.400]   Hmm. You touch on many issues inherent to the eternal balancing of public and private concerns.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:34.160]   Sounds like you attended government schools, did you? Well, yes, I did. It shows. I don't say that
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.680]   to insult you, but since my suspicion was correct, it rather proves my point, doesn't it?
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:47.680]   How so? Because your natural response to my challenge was to defend governmental intrusiveness.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:55.920]   I did not defend governmental intrusiveness. You did, in two ways. First, by not attacking it,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:03.120]   and second, by implying that it should exist in counterbalance to private interests. You did not
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.880]   unreservedly defend an individual's right to his or her own life, which tells me one of two things.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   Either you don't believe in such a right, or if you do, you feel that you have too much to risk
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   by freely admitting it. So, which is it? I do not believe that those issues are as clear-cut
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   as you describe in what I believe. There are many shades of gray. Gray is more deadly than black or
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:35.680]   white. Extremism has never killed as well as moderateness. Please explain. Black or white
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:42.400]   opinions are emphatic and demand an emphatic response. Gray opinions do not, which in turn
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:49.360]   allows bad gray opinions to flourish when they should be challenged. Sometimes moderation is
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:57.200]   called for, but generally it's just BS. Do you have children, Tom? Yes, two daughters, seven and
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:04.720]   ten. Where do they go to school? At a private school. Oh, and you place them there because
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:12.240]   you believe in government schools, right? Well, the public schools in our district are not great.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:18.800]   I'm not surprised. They're not really great anywhere. They were not designed to educate,
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.680]   but to indoctrinate. You can't reform a system which was designed to wither the human mind and
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.200]   spirit. The government schools are doing exactly what they're supposed to do. But you and your wife
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.280]   feel so strongly about quality education for your little girls that you choose to pay twice for it
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:43.840]   since you pay school taxes that you don't use. I guess that's true. Gee, Tom, you could just move
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:50.720]   to Wyoming and pay just once, not twice. Do you actually believe that the United States is ready,
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:57.040]   much less eager for the kind of sweeping educational reform you propose? I can't speak for
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:04.080]   the United States. Nobody can. We're too large of a country for one opinion on the matter, or on any
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:10.240]   matter for that fact. That is precisely why the 50 states must be allowed to once again run their
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.680]   own affairs. I have never declared that what we have chosen in Wyoming should be de rigueur for
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:21.840]   Massachusetts, but unfortunately, Massachusetts believes their system to be de rigueur for all of
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:28.800]   us. And we got it. We have a Prussian Massachusetts system of government schools, which mandates
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.360]   conformity at the expense of thinking. That's over with in Wyoming, and we'll put our literacy
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.200]   rates and SAT scores up against any slave school in the nation, especially those in Massachusetts.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.480]   I still have difficulty in believing public schools to be as poor as you suggest.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:54.000]   If one judges the tree by its fruit, then public education collapsed about 30 years ago. Clerks
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.680]   cannot count change without the register doing it for them. A third of people today do not know who
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:06.080]   won World War II, and nobody can properly diagram a sentence. Why the average PhD cannot pass a
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:12.800]   college entrance exam from 1906. How much more evidence do you need? Still, aren't you being too
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.360]   harsh on the public schools? They do the best they can with the student material they're given.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:23.840]   It's not their fault we have drugs and gang violence. Nonsense, Tom. It is precisely their
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:30.000]   fault. The socialist government schools don't reflect the problems of the outside world.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:39.440]   They are causing these problems. Why are the children into drugs, gangs, and self-mutilation?
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.040]   Why are children exhibiting the social pathologies of prison inmates?
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:53.840]   Because they are prison inmates. There's more freedom at a low-security federal work camp
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.040]   than there is at the local government high school. Children get kidnapped at the age of five
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:06.640]   and sentenced to 12 years of excruciatingly dull and damaging programming. It's a sham,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.400]   and kids know it and were shocked when they rebel. Compare Columbine to Attica,
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.320]   and the murderous rampage of Harris and Klebold becomes more understandable.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:25.680]   After 12 years of indoctrination at the obscene expense of awakened minds,
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:32.160]   most kids have no job prospects beyond McDonald's. Who else can afford to pay a totally unskilled and
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.400]   unthinking employee the current minimum wage of $12.65 an hour? While they're pushing a colorful
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:44.640]   icon of French fries on the register because they can't do the math, their gangsta pals are laughing
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:49.520]   at them for even working at all. Running drugs can make more money in a single day than a month
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:56.320]   of flipping burgers. The entire socialist agenda has created an unnatural America where children
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:04.400]   cannot work and do not want to if they could. And who pays for it? Mom with her two jobs. She works
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.240]   just to pay the family's tax bill, much of it for the local government youth propaganda camp.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.760]   That's assuming she works. Often she's a ward of the state on food stamps, AFDC, public housing,
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:22.080]   etc. If the father actually tries to support her and his children, she loses her welfare checks.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.880]   All this has transformed and ruined our society. So don't defend the government schools as being
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:36.400]   blameless. They're not. Not by a long shot. If they had actually educated children, we'd today
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:43.600]   have grown adults with real minds and real futures. If you had taken the children of 1890s parents
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:51.440]   and put them in today's schools and society, they'd have been horrified and livid with the results.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:58.320]   Even the liberals are finally getting concerned. How so? Well, I have a comic actor friend in
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.680]   Hollywood who is quite well known through his stand-up and movie career. Although we vastly
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.880]   differ on political and religious matters, he once commented that it was absolutely criminal
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:15.520]   that public schools were such cesspools of gang violence, drugs, and apathy. He said that the
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.080]   issue totally transcended any political sensitivities and that our schools were not
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:30.880]   tranquil havens for real learning was a national outrage. I was quite stunned by Rick's intense
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:36.320]   opinion and wholeheartedly agreed with him. We are currently digging the grave of government
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.840]   education in Wyoming. Within two years, we will have achieved separation of school and state.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:48.480]   Education will at last revert to being a family matter, not a government one. The government
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:54.480]   teachers, however, are howling like scowled banshees. You never heard such caterwalling.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.480]   I ask them why they're worried about private sector competition if their government schools
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.800]   are so good. They've no answer for that. They're like Hugo salesmen squealing about the new VW
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:11.520]   dealership going in across the street. Hugo salesmen who secretly drive Volkswagens. What do
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:18.880]   you mean? That many government teachers send their children to private schools. In Chicago, 40% do,
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:25.600]   and in DC, 90% do. It's just like Congress having exempted themselves from their own social security
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:31.120]   creature and enjoying a fully funded private scheme. Government employees should be required
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:37.040]   to live under their own programs. Private schools are well and good for those families who can
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.720]   afford them. But what about poor families? Is it fair that they have no option but public education?
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:49.280]   I don't buy that, Tom. People have an amazing knack for affording that which is important to
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   them. I've seen so-called poor people with a DVD collection to rival my own, satellite dishes and
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:01.920]   big screen TVs in every mobile home. Poor people in America drive better cars than do wealthy people
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:08.160]   in many countries. If education is important, they will find a way to pay for it. But what
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:15.920]   about those living on a fixed income? Yes, well, who fixed it? Money comes from other people who
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.400]   spend it only for perceived value. Why have a fixed perceived value? Anybody can increase their
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   value to others. Instead of spending over 30 hours a week watching TV as a sedative, why not find
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.880]   some productive work? Learn a foreign language from a library, teaching tapes, learn a skill.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:38.720]   But why should innocent children be denied the best education just because they were born to
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:46.560]   low-income parents? And children born to wealthy parents have an unfair advantage? It's an advantage
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.680]   but not an unfair one. Is it fair that low-income parents were born in America?
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:57.440]   Go visit the third world and you'll see some really low-income families. It's not a matter of
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:02.640]   fairness. Look, as human beings who can learn from history, we are capable of not making the
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:10.000]   mistakes of others if we choose not to. This has been the backdrop of Western culture. Observe,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.520]   learn, progress ad infinitum. My parents and my wife's parents worked hard and they worked smart.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:23.120]   They taught us to do the same and we did. My wife and I looked for a mate with the same values and
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.320]   work ethics in order to further that through our children. A family's history, wealth or poverty,
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:39.280]   is not accidental. It is cumulative. It is mostly a result of choice, of sequential programming.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:45.840]   How much of all this is nature and how much is nurture? Nobody knows exactly. However, both can
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:53.040]   be skewed in a family's favor. Over time, enough quality nurture will improve nature. It takes
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:00.560]   conscious effort and constant work because the default is to remain lazy and stupid. Those who
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.240]   work hard and smart deserve to reap the benefits which pass on to their children. That is not
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:12.960]   unfair. That is life. If low-income families are not spending more time at the library than in
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:19.360]   front of the TV, then they are dooming their children to poverty. Being broke is a state of
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:27.520]   finances. Being poor is a state of mind. It is poor thinking which causes poverty and government
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:34.320]   schools are the academies of ignorance. They are programming the masses to fail and they are doing
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:42.400]   so on purpose. But if the poor cannot yet afford private schools, what can they do? Home school,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:48.560]   of course. Even single mothers on welfare can afford to home school. You are a strong supporter
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:55.920]   of home schooling. Why? First of all, it is the right of the parents. Even though the motto of
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:02.160]   UNICEF is "Every child is our child," and even though Hillary Rodham Clinton believes that
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:09.600]   there is no such thing as other people's children, children are not the property of the state.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:18.080]   Secondly, home schoolers consistently test in the 85th percentile at a tenth of the cost of
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.760]   government schools. Now, how the NEA can bitch about home schooling with those results just
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:29.680]   astounds me. Until America demands a separation of school and state, the private schools must
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:36.000]   operate at a severe disadvantage. Even though they do a better job at less than half the cost,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.240]   parents are still forced to first fund the government schools. Those parents who cannot
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.040]   afford private schools have largely turned to home schooling because it's affordable and it's
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:53.120]   effective. An immigrant family from Honduras moved to Riverton, Wyoming about 15 years ago.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.080]   Their home school daughter just won the national spelling bee. In fact, home schoolers have won
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:10.720]   it 16 times in the past 20 years. It's wonderfully embarrassing. Columnist Vin Suprinowicz put it
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.640]   well. He once wrote that every experiment needs a control group. Regarding gun ownership and the
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:22.160]   daily bearing of arms, Vermont and Alaska are the control group for DC and New York City.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:30.400]   For the government schools, the control group is the home schoolers. Amateur housewives are,
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:35.680]   regardless of their race, income, and even educational level, teaching their children
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:41.440]   better than the professionals. By the seventh grade, home schoolers are two years ahead,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:47.120]   and the NEA and the AFT are going bat guano over this. The home schooling movement has saved a
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.880]   large remnant of children from the zombie academies and their dangerous environments.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.480]   These several million children are the seed corn of the future,
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.680]   seed corn which otherwise would have been consumed, leaving us to starve years ago.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:09.040]   What about home schoolers' lack of socialization? Oh, you mean their lack of odd clothes,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:15.680]   tattoos, and body piercings? That they don't act like prison inmates? That lack of socialization
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:20.480]   is a myth. Home schoolers are highly involved in many things, such as scouting, church, sports,
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.360]   field trips, camping, gymnastics, etc. They're not missing out, and university studies have
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   proven that. Although there are no easy answers, the one unimpeachable fact is that parents
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:39.600]   generally know what's best for their own children. The only disagreement will come from those who
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:46.720]   want to cleave children from their families and grind out every spark of individual thought.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:53.440]   I would rather see children taught to be socialists by their home schooling parents
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:59.760]   than children taught to be laissez-faire capitalists by government schools. Although
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.920]   either case is pretty far-fetched, that's how deep my conviction on this goes.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.560]   What do you consider the most outrageous thing about government schools?
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:15.280]   That every school system today has its own Dr. Mengel ready and eager to forcibly prescribe
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:21.120]   some very sophisticated and dangerous brain-chemical-altering drugs, such as Ritalin
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:27.600]   or Prozac. Pot would be less harmful. Not even prison inmates are drugged at the 30% rate of
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:34.800]   our schoolchildren. Many so-called "ADD" or hyperactive children are simply bored and frustrated
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:40.720]   by their cud-chewing environment. I know I was. I believe that the current bio-intrusions on our
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:46.560]   schoolchildren will someday be looked upon with the horror that we now view ancient bloodletting.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:52.640]   Here is a statistic the NEA won't tell you. Over 90% of all infamous killer kids were taking or
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.440]   had been recently taking some form of government-prescribed brain-chemical-altering drug.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:04.080]   Kip Kinkle had been on Prozac, for example. Guns are not the problem. Damaged kids are the problem,
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.360]   and it is the government school system which is doing the damage. Has anybody ever noticed that
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.280]   mass shootings never seem to occur in private or parochial schools?
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.400]   What about the rights of parents who wish to keep their children in the current school system?
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:25.440]   You're mixing what are actually two separate issues. If some parents desire Prussian-style
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.720]   education, then that's their right. They can start up a private school under that format if they wish.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:38.160]   Nobody's stopping them. However, no parent has the right to force childless strangers at gunpoint
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   to pay for schools, Prussian or not. When you say "at gunpoint," are you speaking of taxes?
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:50.800]   Well, of course. Quit paying taxes, and obese, de-student, pistol-packing agents of the state
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:56.080]   will eventually show up at your door. If you resist, they will evict you. Resist eviction,
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.480]   and they will kill you. Don't you know that all taxes are implicitly collected by threat of a
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.600]   gun, pay, or die? This is a cold, hard fact that Americans refuse to face. But Tom, no purpose of
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:15.040]   government is so important as to justify making citizens homeless or dead. No tax collector has
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:21.760]   ever put a gun to my head to collect my taxes. I don't dispute that. However, you've been trained
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:30.800]   by the government to pay without a fuss. So you do. But haven't you ever resented some use of your
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.880]   tax dollars that you wish you could opt out of? Some US military operation overseas, perhaps?
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.040]   Only about three or four times a day. Well, the cost of government is public knowledge.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:49.440]   Why didn't you calculate what percentage it constituted of your income taxes and refuse to
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:58.160]   pay it on explicitly moral grounds, even if it amounted to only $14? My share of it wouldn't
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.760]   likely be worth the trouble. The trouble of calculating the amount or the trouble of standing
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:13.280]   up for your belief? Probably both. Well, then you help make my point for me. We suffer under a large
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.800]   central government, which nips away at us one bite at a time, and we're too cowed to even quantify
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.520]   the injury, much less protest. What if nobody were required to pay taxes? Who would pay then?
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:33.120]   If we truly desired what we were paying for in taxes, then no coercion would really be necessary.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.320]   In the free market, we pay for a movie rather than sneaking in. We pay for a dinner rather
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:44.480]   than sneaking out. Why can't government compete for its resources like everybody else? Because
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.880]   folks don't like what the government is selling. No, taxes are a form of robbery to fund something
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.080]   that the victim would not purchase voluntarily. And to top it off, the thief proclaims that he
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.920]   is robbing you for your own good. I stand by our right to be governed solely by our informed
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:09.360]   consent. That is at the heart of libertarian politics. This tired old notion that nothing
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:17.280]   would get done but for the government and taxes is nonsense. People want roads and schools,
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.000]   and they will find some way to pay for them in the private sector. I don't want to force anybody to
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.840]   be free, yet many Americans would force me to be a slave on their Washington, D.C. plantation
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:38.880]   if they could. It reeks of closed shop unionism. Join or else. They should have the decency to let
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:47.280]   others live their own adult lives as they see fit. Such rugged individualism comes easy for a man of
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.320]   your race and upbringing, but it hardly seems appropriate for those disadvantaged members of
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   our society. Well, men of my race and upbringing are at the helm of the socialist ship of state,
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.880]   so why didn't I go that direction? Still, you can't deny that libertarianism makes much more
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:14.000]   sense for a white, wealthy entrepreneur than for a crippled minority. Oh, which crippled minority do
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.800]   you mean? I don't follow you. Well, do you mean a crippled minority who has maintained his personal
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.160]   dignity and works for an honest living, or a crippled minority who blames the world for his
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:34.240]   condition and votes for his government check? Oh, well, right. You see, it has nothing to do with
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:41.920]   race, education, or handicap. It has everything to do with character. I know several wealthy,
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.680]   white businessmen so venal and conniving that I would not take their personal check.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.000]   Conversely, I know a black woman in Sheridan with MS who founded what is now a thriving
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.360]   internet business and is one of the most honorable and industrious people I know.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   Those with the mentality of a master or slave or thief, whatever their race or condition,
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:14.400]   need a socialist state. Those who value private property and hard work, whatever their race or
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:22.000]   condition, only wish to be left alone, and Wyoming is America's haven for them. They're long overdue
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.440]   for a haven. Today, they have one. We've proven that over the past two and a half years, and we're
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:34.000]   not through yet. Freedom is always unfinished business. Thank you, Governor Preston, for this
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.480]   second interview. It's always interesting, and for me too. We're still waiting for you to visit us
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:46.000]   in Wyoming. It's looking more and more inviting all the time. That concludes that particular
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.480]   article, which again is a fictional account that is written in the context of a novel called "Moulin
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:59.760]   La Baie" by Boston Tea Party. The entire novel is extremely strong, of course, in its ideological
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:06.640]   activism. It is quite fun if you enjoy such novels. I would enjoy reading it. I really liked it,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:13.600]   and I think that you might enjoy it too. I enjoy that format. I always fear when reading to you
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:22.400]   pieces like that, that you will be annoyed by one or two of your own pet peeves and will miss the
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.920]   bigger picture. We have a tendency so frequently to do that. We read something, we listen to
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.440]   something, "Well, I don't like this," and so we reject the rest of it. So my hope is that you
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.640]   don't miss in the handful of things that you and I might disagree with that were recorded in that
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:45.440]   interview, that you don't miss the big picture. The big picture that I am seeking to focus you on
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:55.920]   is the education of your children, and I ask you this. Do the analysis, and don't tell me,
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:04.800]   but sit and talk with your children, with your wife, with your husband. Sit and talk together
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.480]   as a family about the progress that you're making and ask, "Is this the most effective way to do
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:22.160]   this?" Now, I personally am fully convinced that your involvement and your children's involvement
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:29.360]   in the government school system is not the right way, but I do concede that perhaps you may be a
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:36.320]   parent of the lucky few, the lucky few who seem to be able to navigate the labyrinth of government
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.240]   schooling at escape with their love of learning intact. It still seems woefully inefficient to me
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:51.760]   if you were going to take 1500 hours per year times 12 years, totaling 18,000 hours.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.840]   It's very hard for me to believe that you and your student
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:06.080]   could not have dramatically superior results in another context.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.680]   That's what's always so frustrating in this discussion, is that we have a tendency to
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:18.240]   gauge the effectiveness of our personal choices not against the ideal,
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:25.360]   but against our own experience. We always contrast ourself to something that is inherently
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.440]   limited. So the example would be if you're looking and saying, "Well, I'm going to have my child
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   invest 18,000 hours of their life in this enterprise. And look, my child graduated valedictorian,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.760]   and they like learning, and they went off, and they're going to go and become a doctor."
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:49.120]   Great. I don't doubt that. What I do deny is that that same child, when put in a different context,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:56.400]   would not get better results. And this is, for me, deeply personal. The interview that I read for you
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:02.240]   was by Boston Tea Party. That was his mindset and of his fictional character that he created,
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:09.840]   Governor Preston. But my own personal offense at the Prussian style of education is the massive
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.600]   waste of time. And I'm not going to go on ranting on this subject. Just a few final points, and I
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:27.520]   will close today's show. But to conceive, if you take your most competent 18-year-old graduate,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:33.920]   the valedictorian at the local government school, if you were to take that child
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:42.880]   and put them into... And just put them at home, use that natural enthusiasm for learning, that
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:50.160]   natural inherent motivation, that strong family dynamic that must have been present to encourage
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:57.200]   them on to academic greatness. It doesn't happen without family support. If you were to take that
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:04.240]   same character that enabled that child to sit at home and study when they would probably have
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:10.160]   rather been doing something more indulgent, and you were to put them into a different context,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.320]   a private at school or a homeschool context, they would have been able to achieve those
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.400]   same results on perhaps 20% of the time. The average homeschooled student in the United
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.320]   States of America, the average family spends something like... And I don't have these numbers
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:32.080]   in front of me, but my memory is pretty good on this. Something like $600 a year on the cost of
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:39.280]   their child's school materials. Now, that doesn't include the value of a parent, usually the mother,
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.240]   that doesn't include the value of the mother's time in that schooling. Whereas in the government
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.080]   school, you're paying for the time of the teacher. So it's not a fair comparison to say, "Well,
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.280]   it's $600 versus 12,500," unless we were to add a dollar value to the parent's time and then add in
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.720]   the cost of security, the cost of a big fancy bill, all the rest of this stuff. So it's not a
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   true thing. But most parents spend about $600 a year. And most homeschool students
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:13.120]   do their schooling, many of them in traditional kind of curricula, most homeschool students do
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.600]   their schooling in about three to four hours a day and get more done in three to four hours a day
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.400]   than most government school children get done in nine or 10 hours a day.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.880]   And if you took that valedictorian who is probably investing an average of 10 or 11 hours a day with
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:37.440]   the extra study time required, and you free them of the entire system, they'll get better results.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:48.240]   Now, you do the math, do the math on the time, but I am convinced beyond measure that that amount of
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.840]   time that you're telling your children to invest in something can be so much better served
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:03.360]   with something that is carefully tailored to them. Which is why, in closing, I encourage you,
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:10.320]   as we finish this academic year, consider carefully the results that you are getting
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:21.760]   with your money, with your time, and see if there might not be a better solution for next year.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.520]   Thank you for listening. You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:32.960]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics and
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:39.040]   techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals. Before you go, three simple
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.440]   requests. One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:52.400]   take action on it. Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   lead to a life change. It's action that leads to a life change. So take action. Two, take something
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.400]   that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody that you care about. I'm depending
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:15.360]   on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message that I'm seeking to share.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:23.040]   That helps the person that you are engaging with, and it also helps you because teaching others is
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:30.160]   one of the most effective ways for you to learn and for you to cement your learning. Three, if
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.240]   there's an idea that's been specifically helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take action
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.720]   on it. If you're gaining financial benefit from Radical Personal Finance, I'd be grateful if you'd
