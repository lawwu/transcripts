[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:21.260]  › That was a funny joke. The only thing that is available at a low cost is government schooling. Here in Florida where I live, the government is rolling out a whole new program to try to get your three-year-old enrolled in free, free, get it? So funny.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:48.720]   In free schooling.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   So the question would be, is that a good deal? Is it a good deal for you to take the free option of government schooling for your child? Well, let's talk about it. I want to assume that your child is currently enrolled in the government schools. So here would be a question. How would you assume that your child is currently enrolled in the government schools?
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:18.180]  , How many hours did your child spend in school this last year? How much money did that cost you and are you getting your money's worth? Let's start first with the hours. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, if we look at a national average across the United States of America, the national average for the total amount of time spent in the classroom is 6.64 hours per day per student.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.180]   So here would be a question. How many hours did your child spend in school this last year? How much money did that cost you and are you getting your money's worth? Let's start first with the hours. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, if we look at a national average across the United States of America, the national average for the total amount of time spent in the classroom is 6.64 hours per day per student.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:47.640]   So here would be a question. How many hours did your child spend in the classroom this last year? How much money did that cost you and are you getting your money's worth? Let's start first with the hours. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, if we look at a national average across the United States of America, the national average for the total amount of time spent in the classroom is 6.64 hours per student.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   It's about 6.5 hours a day for 180 days. Multiply 6.64 hours per day times 180 days and you wind up with 1,195 hours of total classroom time that your child has enjoyed, I mean been involved in over the last year. Now, for the sake of some simple verbal language, I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.200]   I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:06:18.220]  , and I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   and I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   and I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   and I'm going to give you a little bit of time.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Now, depending on other activities,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Now, depending on other activities,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Now, depending on other activities,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   That number may be higher or lower.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Your child may be involved in extracurricular activities,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Which would add more time.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Perhaps your child does homework.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   If you added one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about nine hours per day.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   If we multiplied nine hours per day times 180 days, we'd wind up with 1,620 hours of total time.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Let's just split the difference.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   For the sake of verbal math, assume 1,500 hours of time from your school
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   from your school.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   That's right.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   Now, depending on other activities,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   That number may be higher or lower.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   If you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:07:18.260]  ,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   That's right.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:48.280]  ,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day. So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would be a day, that would be a day. So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would be a day, that would be a day.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:08:18.300]   So, if you add one hour of homework per day, that would wind up being about 9 hours per day.

[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   The big picture that I am seeking to focus you on is the education of your children.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   Do the analysis and don't tell me, but sit and talk with your children, with your wife, with your husband.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   Sit and talk together as a family about the progress that you're making and ask, is this the most effective way to make a family?
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   Is this the most effective way to make a family?
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   Is this the most effective way to make a family?

[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:54.980]   I personally am fully convinced that your involvement and your children's involvement in the government school system is not the right way.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   But I do concede that perhaps you may be a parent of the lucky few.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   The lucky few who seem to be able to navigate the labyrinth of government schooling at escape with their love of learning intact.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   Is this the most effective way to make a family?
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:54.980]   Is this the most effective way to make a family?

[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:21.160]   If you were going to take 1,500 hours per year times 12 years, totaling 18,000 hours, it's very hard for me to believe that you and your student could not have dramatically superior results in another context.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.000]   That's what's always so frustrating in this discussion.

[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:49.440]   I'm going to have my child invest 18,000 hours of their life in this enterprise.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.020]   And look, my child graduated valedictorian and they like learning and they went off to the next level.
