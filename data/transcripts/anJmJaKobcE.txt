[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   If one has parents, let's say, who are "slowing down" a bit, and they're talking a little
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.600]   bit about some aches and pains, and there's a stairwell in the house, for instance, and
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.160]   they're starting to say things like, "You know, at some point, we're either going to
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.320]   have to move into a place that doesn't have a stairwell or put one of those chair lifts
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.320]   and things, or maybe just move into the downstairs," do you think that in just thinking about that,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.760]   they're going to accelerate the demise of their locomotor ability?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.800]   I do, actually.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   I think that when we start entertaining these negative thoughts and evaluating ourselves,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   we're always going to find evidence.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   As you get older, you start, "Oh, my God, am I forgetful?"
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.480]   You pay attention each time you forget, and that makes it even worse.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.320]   I said to my students in this health class, smart kids at Harvard, this is on Thursday,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.080]   I teach Tuesday and Thursday, I said, "What was the last thing I said in class on Tuesday?"
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080]   Nobody remembers.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.480]   I said, "You must be getting dementia," so that when a young person forgets, it's okay,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.440]   they don't pay any attention to the forgetting.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.600]   As you get older and you forget, you get less involved in what you're doing.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.800]   If you're trying to learn something, you have the competing part of you saying that you're
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   not going to remember this, and so on.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.720]   Independent of all of this, I think a lot of the loss in memory has nothing to do with
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.640]   memory.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.080]   When I was young, and you're introducing me to people, I thought it was important for
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.400]   me to remember their names.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.960]   Andrew, I know, doesn't speak well of me.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   I don't really care.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.520]   You're going to introduce me to five of you, what do I care?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.800]   If I'm going to need their names, chances are I will meet them again.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.920]   Afterwards, if you say to me, "Remember Jim," and I say to you, "Which one was Jim?"
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.800]   It wasn't that I forgot.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   To forget means I had to have learned it in the first place.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.480]   If you don't learn it in the first place because you don't care, because your values change
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.840]   as you get older, then it's not a matter of forgetting when you don't know it in the second
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.760]   place.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.440]   I think that if we turn it around, because now I'm doing this because I know you expect
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.240]   it of me, and we say, "What if you remembered everything?"
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   Everything.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.240]   That would be terrible.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   How would you get through?
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   It's a picture.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.760]   You wouldn't get to experience anything new.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.160]   Everything serves a purpose.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   I never tested this.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.960]   We came up with this years ago, and I think it's probably wrong, but it's kind of fun.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.080]   People as they get older, they become hard of hearing, but it also happens that the older
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   you get, the more you realize nobody is really saying anything.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.920]   Being hard of hearing protects you from a lot of that noise.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.320]   My grandfather used to turn off his hearing aid.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.360]   I've always had glasses for reading at night when my eyes would get fatigued or something,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.280]   but recently I came to my awareness that my vision at a distance is very, very sharp.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   I'm like an eagle.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.840]   I can read numbers very far away, but my vision up close has been diminishing.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.920]   I find myself straining a bit more even than it is, so I started wearing eyeglasses.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.440]   Or you should have the book further away.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.000]   Or I should have the book further away, but I've just defaulted to eyeglasses.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.320]   I realized that because I understand the neuroplasticity of the visual system that I'm certainly accelerating
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.120]   the demise of my near vision by wearing glasses, and so I'm trying to balance the two.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.040]   Do you know our vision study?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.840]   This is kind of fun.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.560]   I'm in the doctor's office, and like everybody else, I'm given the Snellenite chart.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.840]   The Snellen is the letters and numbers, yeah.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.240]   But I'm different from most people, and I resent that the letters are getting smaller
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   and smaller because it's creating an expectation that soon I won't be able to see.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.600]   So I ask, "What would happen if the letters got larger and larger?"
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.940]   Which would be to change the expectation that soon I will be able to see.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.960]   So when we do that, people are able to see what they weren't able to see before.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.440]   Now, most of us have trouble around two-thirds of the way down the chart, so what we did
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.280]   was start the chart a third of the way down, so the letters are smaller than on top.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.160]   So now two-thirds of the way down, that starting point, the letters are really small, and what
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.640]   happens is, again, people can see what they couldn't see before.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   Awesome.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:09.760]   So the idea that your vision has to get worse, I think there are many, many instances where
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.400]   that's not the case, but also the whole test of vision is bizarre.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.100]   How often in your life are you looking at letters that make no sense?
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.040]   If I don't want to see you, I'm going to see you a lot sooner than being able to run away
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   from you.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.560]   If I'm hungry, I can see the restaurant sign much quicker than if I'm not hungry.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.920]   I see things in color that are different in black and white, so on and so forth, and to
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.000]   lose all of that with a two-dimensional eye test seems to me ... And again, we haven't
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.680]   touched on this, but it's probably important with respect to vision.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.680]   It's true with everything.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.520]   In fact, I tell people, "You're wearing glasses.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.240]   Try it without glasses.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.080]   You want to see when you can see and when you can't see."
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:10.040]   With almost everything, we again hold things still when they're varying.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   Now what I mean by this is that, let's say with vision, my guess is that 11 o'clock in
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.800]   the morning, my vision is better than at 7 o'clock at night.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   The data says yes.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   Okay.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   I mean, it'd be hard for it not ... So what does this say?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.240]   This says maybe I should either have a nap.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.600]   I don't nap, so I should have an energy bar, and even an energy bar is cute.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.800]   It's just a candy bar, but you call it an energy bar.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   You're allowed to eat it.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.720]   It's like you take a piece of cake, put it in a muffin tin.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   It's called a muffin.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's healthier than the piece of cake.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.260]   Anyway, I'll leave that as it may.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:59.360]   That control, a great amount of control over our physical well-being comes about by attention
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.720]   to variability, which is just a fancy way of talking about mindfulness.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.480]   Mindfulness is noticing change.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.920]   That's what it means to be variable.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   All right.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.440]   So if you took your glasses off and you saw for yourself, what are the times, what are
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.800]   the moments that you're having ... I'm not talking about people who are almost blind,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.360]   where I can't see and when I can see, and then you ask yourself why, and then it may
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.800]   be the case that it's a particular font, or more likely that you're tired, and then you
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.480]   have other options.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.920]   But once you start wearing them, it's like taking a laxative.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.500]   Take a laxative once, it's fine.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.840]   If you're taking a laxative all the time, you're teaching your body to depend on the
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.160]   laxative.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   You can teach ourselves by some of these things that are supposed to be helpful, and we teach
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.640]   ourselves to need them in ways we otherwise wouldn't.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.380]   And so he did this attention to symptom variability with big diseases.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.520]   So when you have a chronic illness, the way most people understand chronic illness is
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.360]   that there's nothing that can be done about it.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.120]   Yeah, the word chronic implies that.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   Exactly.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   What it means is the medical world doesn't have a fix.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.240]   It doesn't mean there's nothing can be done.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.320]   Now, you have your symptoms of the chronic illness, the presumption most of the time,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.440]   I would think, is that the symptoms are going to stay the same or get worse.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.800]   Nothing only moves in one direction.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.320]   Sometimes it's a little better, sometimes a little ... The stock market, if it's going
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   up, it doesn't go up in a straight line, it goes up, down a little, and so on.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.560]   So when it's better, why is it better?
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.920]   So we do this, we call people periodically, and we simply ask them, "How is the symptom
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.040]   now?
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.000]   Is it better or worse than the last time we called, and why?"
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.200]   Several things happen.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.520]   The first, by engaging in the whole process, people feel less helpless, and that turns
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.640]   out to be good for your health.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.600]   Second, once you start noticing that now it's a little better, it can even be a little worse,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.680]   you feel better because you thought that it was always maximally, "I'm always in pain,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.120]   I'm always stressed," whatever it is, third, or whatever I'm up to.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.160]   By asking the question, "Why now?
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.520]   Is it better or worse than before?" you engage in a mindful search.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.040]   I have decades of evidence that that mindfulness itself, the neurons are firing, that itself
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.600]   is good for your health.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.120]   And then finally, I believe you're more likely to find a solution if you're looking for one.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.440]   So we've done this with multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, Parkinson's, stroke, biggies,
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.760]   and in each case have very positive results.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.040]   And the good thing about these sorts of things is that there are no negative side effects,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.200]   and it doesn't mean that you have to stop doing any medical procedures you may be doing.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   But you're asking, you're back in charge of your own healthcare.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.000]   Why does this hurt now?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Stress.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.400]   There are some people who think they're stressed all the time.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.960]   Nobody is anything all the time.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.080]   So I call you, Andrew, and I say, "How stressed are you now, and why?"
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.920]   And we go through this over time, and then you find out you're stressed when you're talking
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   to Ellen Langer.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:35.680]   Well, then the solution is easy, don't talk to me.
