[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.120]   - A wife writes in to ask this,
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.520]   "Pastor John, I and my husband cannot reach an agreement
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.260]   "about a certain thing, so we have decided to ask you.
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.480]   "I can't stand when we watch a movie
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.440]   "and there are scenes with naked women.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.460]   "I know that he doesn't lust for them
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.920]   "and he doesn't fantasize about them,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160]   "but it just bothers me when he sees other women.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.600]   "So the question is simply this,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.860]   "is my husband obligated to give up movies
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.060]   "with sexual or nude scenes if I don't like it
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.600]   "because I'm jealous?"
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.940]   - Yes. (laughs)
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.980]   But I don't wanna start there, even though I just did,
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.940]   because I put the emphasis in the wrong place
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.880]   by making him do it because she's ticked.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.940]   That's not the right motive.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.480]   First of all, I would want to know,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.120]   is your husband a believer?
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.840]   Sounds like he is, but is he a believer?
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680]   Does he want to honor Christ above all?
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.380]   Does he want his mind and heart to be pure
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.380]   and full of what is true and honorable and just
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.840]   and pure and lovely and commendable and excellent
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.780]   and worthy of praise, Philippians 4:8.
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.380]   Does he believe that sin killed Jesus,
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.380]   that this woman taking off her clothes
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.740]   in order to make a movie more racy
[00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.400]   and get a lower rating and a higher attendance,
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.020]   that that sin killed Jesus?
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.800]   Is he okay with that?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.020]   Okay watching that, okay endorsing that,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080]   okay making light of that.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.600]   And does he realize that Jesus died to kill sin?
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.700]   So this sin killed Jesus and Jesus died to kill this sin
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.040]   and here you are playing with it as though it doesn't matter.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.240]   Does he agree with that?
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440]   So that would be my starting point.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   And if he's a believer, I would say he is obligated
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   to give up these movies, not first for the wife's sake,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.120]   but for Christ's sake.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.560]   Both of you, I would say to her,
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.480]   both of you should disapprove of these scenes
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.420]   other than jealousy.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.500]   These scenes should not be watched for other reasons
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.680]   like they're unloving, they're unloving to the women
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.200]   because watching these scenes, buying these movies,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   paying to go see them endorses de facto,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   endorses behaviors and desires in those scenes,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   those women that are going to destroy them.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.960]   If the woman who's performing nudely for a living
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.480]   doesn't repent of that, she's gonna go to hell.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.860]   Here you are saying it's okay to buy, to watch it.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.760]   It's unloving to that woman's future husband
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.520]   or if she has a husband because it's gonna make life harder
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.040]   for her to have a normal, wholesome, sexual relationship
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   having stripped herself bare for so many men
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.400]   and been touched in so many ways
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   that nothing seems sacred and pure and precious anymore
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.780]   for her husband.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.520]   And I've thought of this so many times
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.200]   as I've wrestled with what do I let myself watch?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   I have a daughter.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   If my daughter decided that she was going to sell her body
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.240]   to be looked at by men in movies or at a strip show
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.360]   my heart would be broken, which means that all those men
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.760]   who endorse that, pay for that, encourage that
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.800]   and enjoy that don't give a rip for me and my broken heart.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   So it's just so unloving to glide through these scenes
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.080]   as though they weren't massively important for life
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.960]   and they're just plain adulterous.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.160]   I mean, this wife is naive, I think,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   if she thinks that these scenes in her husband's head
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.600]   have no relationship to how he relates to her.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.040]   That's crazy.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.200]   That means every time he's lying with her
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.160]   he's got competitors in his brain, he does.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.920]   And the more he has watched, the more competitors he has.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.080]   And if she happens to be not cool that night
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.800]   he'll just switch gears and go into one of those scenes
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.920]   and that's the way he'll have his stimulation.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.640]   That's adultery.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.520]   And so I think she needs to wake up to the fact
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.480]   that he may say, "Oh, I'm not lusting or whatever."
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   They're there and they're locked down there
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.880]   and they'll be there in years to come.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.720]   And he'll use them in 40 years, if not tomorrow
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   when she's not so pretty.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.880]   And they're just destructive to a man's soul.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.400]   Our souls shrink to the kind of pleasures
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.920]   we're indulging in.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.120]   This man's not gonna be able to read his Bible as sweetly.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.880]   He's not gonna enjoy the fellowship of God as sweetly.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.840]   He's not gonna look at sunsets the same
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   and he's not gonna look at little babies the same.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.120]   His soul has always got this defilement
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.920]   that he's cherishing in there
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.600]   because he thinks it's no big deal.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.300]   And that is going to push out bigger, nobler,
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.080]   more beautiful things.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.800]   So I think lastly, he should really care
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.440]   about what his wife thinks.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.520]   And if his wife is being wounded by this,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.080]   if she can't quite articulate what it is,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.240]   she just knows this is not right.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   I think she is intuitively wholesome and he's a jerk
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.600]   if he doesn't get this.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.320]   And he needs to listen to John Piper, read his Bible,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.960]   look to Jesus in the cross
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.440]   and realize that sinning on that screen.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.500]   And I don't just mean the play acting sinning in the movie.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.600]   I don't even know if it is.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.320]   I mean the sinning in the studio
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.680]   where this woman created in God's image
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.600]   is walking around naked, being gawked at by cameraman
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.000]   and being told by directors how to slant
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.360]   this part of her body and that part of her body.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.880]   That whole scene of sin right there
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   is something that he should be deeply offended by
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.800]   and profoundly broken hearted by for the woman herself
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.920]   and for her parents and for her husband
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.600]   and for the whole beauty of Christ that he made sex for,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.320]   which is being so prostituted there on the screen.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.240]   It's not a spectator sport.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.280]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
