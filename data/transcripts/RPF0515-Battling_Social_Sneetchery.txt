[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Now the star-belly sneetches had bellies with stars.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.600]   The plain-belly sneetches had none upon thars.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.120]   Those stars weren't so big, they were really so small.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.520]   You might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:23.000]   But because they had stars, all the star-belly sneetches would brag, "We're the best kind
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.720]   of sneetch on the beaches!"
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   With their snoots in the air, they would sniff and they'd snort, "We'll have nothing to
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.340]   do with the plain-belly sort!"
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.200]   And whenever they met some when they were out walking, they'd hike right on past them
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.000]   without even talking.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.920]   When the star-belly children went out to play ball, could a plain-belly get in the game?
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.060]   Not at all.
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.480]   You could only play if your bellies had stars and the plain-belly children had none upon
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.980]   thars.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.200]   When the star-belly sneetches had frankfurter roasts, or picnics or parties or marshmallow
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.900]   toasts, they never invited the plain-belly sneetches.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.120]   They left them out cold in the dark of the beaches.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.600]   They kept them away, never let them come near, and that's how they treated them, year after
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   year.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.400]   Then, one day, it seems, while the plain-belly sneetches were moping and doping alone on
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.000]   the beaches, just sitting there wishing their bellies had stars, a stranger zipped up in
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.880]   the strangest of cars.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.520]   "My friends," he announced in a voice clear and keen, "my name is Sylvester McMonkey
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.360]   McBean, and I've heard of your troubles, I've heard you're unhappy, but I can fix
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480]   that, I'm the Fix-It-Up Chappy.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.160]   I've come here to help you, I have what you need, and my prices are low, and I work at
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.120]   great speed, and my work is one hundred percent guaranteed."
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:00.480]   Then, quickly, Sylvester McMonkey McBean put together a very peculiar machine, and he said,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.760]   "You want stars like a star-belly sneetch?
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   My friends, you can have them for three dollars each.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.520]   Just pay me your money and hop right aboard."
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.720]   So they clamored inside.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.800]   Then the big machine roared, and it clonked, and it bonked, and it jerked, and it burked,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.460]   and it bopped them about.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.520]   But the thing really worked.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.680]   When the plain-belly sneetches popped out, they had stars.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   They actually did, they had stars upon thars.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.660]   Then they yelled at the ones who had stars from the start, "We're exactly like you,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.400]   you can't tell us apart.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.640]   We're all just the same now, you snooty old smarties, and now we can go to your Frankfurter
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640]   berries."
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.400]   "Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.080]   "We're still the best sneetches, and they are the worst.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.680]   But now, how in the world will we know," they all frowned, "if which kind is what,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280]   or the other way round?"
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.680]   Then up came McBean with a very sly wink, and he said, "Things are not quite as bad
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.900]   as you think.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.600]   So you don't know who's who, that is perfectly true.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   But come with me, friends, do you know what I'll do?
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.800]   I'll make you, again, the best sneetches on beaches, and all it will cost you is ten
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.080]   dollars eaches."
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.680]   "Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.480]   "What you need is a trip through my star-off machine.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.400]   This wondrous contraption will take off your stars, so you won't look like sneetches who
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.540]   have them on thars."
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.760]   And that handy machine, working very precisely, removed all the stars from their tummies quite
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.040]   nicely.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.600]   Then with snoots in the air, they paraded about, and they opened their beaks and they
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.040]   let out a shout, "We know who is who, now there isn't a doubt.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.840]   The best kind of sneetches are sneetches without."
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.760]   Then of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.840]   To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:18.280]   Then of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean invited them into his star-off machine.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.200]   Then of course, from then on, as you probably guessed, things really got into a horrible
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.680]   mess.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.320]   All the rest of that day on those wild screaming beaches, the Fix-It-Up chappy kept fixing
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.360]   up sneetches, off again, on again, in again, out again.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.280]   Through the machines they raced round and about again, changing their stars every minute
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   or two.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.680]   They kept paying money.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.840]   They kept running through, until neither the plane nor the star bellies knew whether this
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.400]   one was that one or that one was this one or which one was what one or what one was
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.840]   who.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:05.280]   Then when every last cent of their money was spent, the Fix-It-Up chappy packed up and
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.040]   he went.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.280]   And he laughed as he drove in his car up the beach.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.080]   They never will learn.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   No, you can't teach a sneetch.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.960]   But McBean was quite wrong, I'm quite happy to say, that the sneetches got really quite
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.320]   smart on that day.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.000]   The day they decided that sneetches are sneetches, and no kind of sneetch is the best on the
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.540]   beaches.
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.480]   That day all the sneetches forgot about stars, and whether they had one or not, upon thars.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   Welcome to the Dr. Seuss Story Children's Hour tonight.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.800]   Wait, sorry.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.480]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.680]   skills, insights, encouragement and fun little stories that you need to live a rich and meaningful
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.520]   life now while building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:30.200]   Today we talk about stars and sneetches and diamonds and duds and drives.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.200]   Happy Monday my friends.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   It is a brand new week and a brand new year.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.080]   I hope that you are off to a great new year.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   How does it get better if you start your day with Dr. Seuss?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   And of course, as with every good little story, I could probably stop right there and you
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.280]   can pick up the lessons and the morals of the story for yourself.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.560]   Now of course, some things are rather obvious, like the fact that sneetches are sneetches
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   whether they have stars on their bellies or not.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.320]   And frankly, we could use that lesson today.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.300]   So many of us are quick to judge one another by the stars on their bellies or the lack
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.440]   of stars and draw our conclusions rather hastily.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.760]   But today, of course, this is Radical Personal Finance.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.160]   And in the context of this show, although I would dearly love to preach for the next
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.580]   hour on that topic, in the context of this show, we talk about money.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.360]   And since my desire is for you to plan for, work towards and achieve financial freedom
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.940]   in your life, my goal today is to help you make sure that when your Mr. McBean tumbles
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:51.040]   on down the road, that your every last cent is not spent in the fix-it-up chappies pocket
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.120]   for his stupid machines to put on stars and take them off again.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.920]   Now in order to do that, we need some discussion points.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.360]   And so very few of us are worried about the stars on our bellies, but I thought it'd be
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.640]   fun in the theme of and the modeling of Dr. Seuss, why not have a little alliteration?
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   And so today we're going to talk about diamonds, duds, and drives.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.640]   That was the best I could do on short notice, diamonds, duds, and drives.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.000]   And I want to talk to you about some strategies to help you avoid some of the peer pressure
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.880]   that you face, the peer pressure on all sides.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   Because frankly, many of us spend money constantly because of peer pressure.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.280]   And none of us are exempted.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:40.240]   I face continually, continually the pressure and the desire to spend money based upon peer
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.720]   pressure.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.080]   Sometimes I can evade that pressure, sometimes I cannot, but it's a constant challenge.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.160]   And I expect it'll be a challenge through all of my life, and thus I expect it'll be
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.000]   a challenge through all of your life because we all face that pressure.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.560]   And I want to give you three simple strategies to help you deal with the peer pressure for
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   spending.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.320]   It's all well and good to recognize that keeping up with the Joneses really isn't a great move.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.460]   It's all well and good to recognize that intellectually, but today I want to help you have some strategies
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.580]   for how you can avoid it.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.320]   And these strategies are very simple.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.080]   The fashions of the day will come and go, whether it's in to have stars or out to have
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.360]   stars on your belly, or whether it's in to have long pants or short pants or big bottoms
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.840]   or bell bottoms or tight pants or skinny pants or sleeves or any of these things.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.080]   The fashions will come and go.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.320]   I recently was reading a book and the author of the book talked about the fact that he
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.160]   had found this great coat that his mom was going to get rid of, a great camel-haired
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.320]   coat, and he got it for free from his mom because she was getting rid of it because
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.320]   it was out of fashion.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   And he wore it for 40 years.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.200]   An older man said he wore it for 40 years, and for about two or three of those years
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.160]   he was completely in fashion because those were the years that the fashion industry brought
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.200]   back that fashion, and so his friends during those 40 years, "You know what?
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.600]   Let me find it."
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   And I'm back.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.440]   So the book was the book How to Survive – excuse me.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.880]   You'll have to forgive me.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.200]   My co-hosts haven't had their morning coffee yet.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.640]   The book that I was flipping through is called How to Survive Without a Salary, Learning
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.800]   How to Live the Conserver Lifestyle by Charles Long.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.600]   And it's a good book.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.800]   I have a number of these books, but it's some of the past genre of books on how to
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.600]   live cheap, and I really enjoy these books.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.000]   I was going through and working on my book scanning project, and that gave me the opportunity
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.560]   to flip through some of these older books.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   A little embarrassing.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.320]   I guess my details were a little bit wrong, but here is the paragraph from page 57 of
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.520]   Charles Long's How to Survive Without a Salary.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.640]   He relates this story.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.560]   I'll start three paragraphs before.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.000]   He says, "Look again, however, at the goods that fashion does change.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.080]   They are the ones that don't need to have structural obsolescence built in.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.800]   They last forever.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.960]   When is the last time you wore out a necktie and a Nehru suit, like a diamond, is forever?
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.000]   The real conserver is impervious to the dictates of fashion, but is a victim, nevertheless,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.960]   of planned obsolescence.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.040]   He may not change his ties to match the current width or length, but his light bulbs will
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.800]   burn out like everyone else's.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.400]   Knowing, however, that fashionable goods are discarded because of style rather than wear,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.000]   he can often find best value by deliberately seeking out of fashion bargains.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   The conserver, examining his needs or reaching for his wallet, asks himself, "Whose need
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   is it?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.400]   Mine or the Joneses?"
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.480]   By ignoring artificial needs created by fashions and emulations, the conserver concentrates
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.800]   his money on the things that are really important to him, not on the straw men set up by the
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.160]   electronic snake oil peddlers.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.960]   From the day my son understood this simple concept, he was never again suckered into
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.040]   anything with the promise of dessert.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.480]   Some years ago, Grandmother was cleaning out her rag bag, scissoring up wool for a rug
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.900]   she was making.
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.680]   She pulled out a heavy camel hair coat, gleaned from a rich and distant cousin's discards.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   There was absolutely nothing wrong with the coat, except that camel hair and narrow lapels
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.240]   were just a year passe.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.880]   For protests, I salvaged the intended rug and wore it simply because it was delightfully
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   warm.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.340]   I wore it for thirty years.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.100]   It was indestructible, and in at least two years out of those thirty, my coat was back
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.420]   in fashion.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.400]   At least I presumed it was back in fashion.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.220]   Those were the years when acquaintances would admire and marvel that I could afford such
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.860]   a wonderful coat.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.940]   In the other twenty-eight years, I got sympathy and was treated to coffee a lot.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:46.540]   All that mattered to me, though, is that for thirty years, the coat fulfilled my need perfectly.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.140]   It didn't always meet others' criteria of what a coat should be, but distinguishing
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:57.020]   clearly between their needs and mine saved the cost of thirty years of top coats.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.300]   So back to our Dr. Seuss introduction.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:04.900]   Old McMarty McBean was the brilliant guy in this whole story because he walked away with
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.580]   a pocket full of money.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.420]   And I encourage you, whenever you can fill your pocket with other people's monies by
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:16.460]   selling them services that they desperately desire, I encourage you to do so, but to do
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.040]   it in a way that you'll feel good when you drive away with your pockets full of money.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.820]   But the key here today is I want to help you protect your pocket of money.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.500]   In order to do that, I want to give you these strategies.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   So here are the three strategies that I know of to help you confront the peer pressure
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.660]   that affects you and wants to affect your decisions.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.860]   Number one, you can conform to the fashion of the day.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:47.540]   As stupid as it may be, so that you can enjoy acceptance by the group and further your own
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.540]   goals.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.540]   That's strategy number one.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.420]   Just conform and embrace it.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.660]   Strategy number one.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:59.300]   Strategy number two, find a workaround that gives you plausible deniability without direct
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.580]   confrontation.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:07.220]   So find some way to get there without fully embracing it.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:16.380]   And number three, engage in the direct confrontation of the fashion at hand and make your mark
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.620]   by going against it.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.780]   Now these three strategies I'm going to weave for you just a few bits of advice around the
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.340]   concept of diamonds, duds, and drives.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.260]   So of course I mean here diamonds as in diamond rings and diamond jewelry, duds as in the
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.340]   clothes that you wear, and drives meaning the cars that you drive.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.700]   Because these are three just interesting cultural sensations that all matter.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:46.580]   The first thing we need to emphasize is culture and fitting into the group matters.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.580]   It matters.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.580]   I don't think it's a good place to start to say it shouldn't matter.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.380]   And so therefore I'm just going to ignore it.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.380]   That's foolish.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.380]   It does matter.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.060]   I've been teaching a course on career and income planning.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.140]   In that course, guess what?
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.940]   The fashions of the day matter.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.240]   You need to fit into the group.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.020]   If you're working in a job where your coworkers all wear white, I recommend that you wear
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.360]   white.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.380]   You've got to fit into the group because if you don't fit into the group, you'll make
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.700]   other people uncomfortable.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:25.340]   And it's not stupid to recognize this truth.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.500]   Signaling theory, which is a well-researched area of sociology, I guess would be the discipline
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.860]   it would fall into.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.580]   But signaling theory would say that people will perceive you the way that you signal
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.060]   yourself to be.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.060]   And this is important.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.980]   If you want to fit into the company culture, you should fit into the company culture.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:51.020]   You don't go for a job interview at your local white collar attorney firm wearing muddy work
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:57.820]   boots, jeans with holes in them, and a buttoned down flannel shirt that still smells like
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.060]   cow manure.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.300]   You're not going to get the job.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:08.220]   In the same way you don't show up for work or the job interview at your local dairy farm
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.300]   wearing a pair of $500 dress shoes and an Armani suit.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.740]   You're not going to get the job.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.620]   You got to look something close to the way that your interviewer or your boss expects
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.420]   you to look.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.140]   And it's foolish to assume otherwise.
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:34.180]   So don't start by embracing your spirit of nonconformity, especially if you're young
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.180]   or you're broke.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.900]   Start by embracing your spirit of conformity and then figuring out an intelligent way to
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.980]   do that.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.060]   The clothes that you wear matter.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.340]   And I think it's important to recognize that.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.940]   So strategy number one, if you're looking at your clothes, you need to recognize that
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.700]   your clothes matter.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:17:00.700]   And being out of step with your company or with your culture is not very smart.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:08.740]   It will bring upon your head abuse unnecessarily.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:17.620]   No matter how stupid the fashion may be objectively, if you're in the middle of the place where
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:26.100]   that fashion is acceptable and important, you probably should consider embracing it
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.580]   until you can get out of that place.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.580]   This stuff matters.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.260]   It matters if you're a junior attorney who just got hired on out of law school.
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.500]   Well, in that case, you better look like an attorney.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.420]   You better drive like an attorney.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:55.100]   You better signal to your clients and coworkers your attorney-ness.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.220]   That's a good place to start.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.220]   Conform to the fashion.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.140]   Now, does that mean that you have to be stupid about it?
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.780]   No, I don't think so.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:02.780]   You can still try to be smart.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.660]   In a moment, we'll go to that workaround because I think there are workarounds.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.860]   But if you need to wear attorney clothes, do it.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.340]   Just buy them as smart as you can.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.980]   Try to find all the ways to save on them so that you can keep more money in your pocket
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.180]   while still signaling your attorney-ness.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.220]   If you need to drive an attorney's car, do it.
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:29.460]   But try to find ways to drive and express your attorney-ness in your driving without
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:36.540]   being so utterly stupid as to get ripped off or to spend more than you can afford.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.540]   Conform to the fashion, as stupid as it may be, so that you can enjoy the acceptance by
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.300]   the group and further your personal goals.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:50.540]   Now, in my opinion, this applies in other areas, even as dumb as they may be.
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:56.140]   Let me give an example of something that always drives me nuts.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.740]   Diamond engagement rings.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:04.340]   If you research the history of diamond engagement rings, you will find that the entire thing
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.540]   is a giant marketing facade.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:16.520]   It is dumb the fact that we men give to our loved ones diamond rings to try to impress
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.880]   upon them how valuable we are so that they'll marry us.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.940]   That is dumb.
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.980]   It's objectively dumb for multiple reasons.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.780]   Number one, diamonds, they may last forever, but they're not in short supply.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:42.540]   There are many, many diamonds and the market is artificially controlled and manipulated
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.900]   in order to make them have perceived value.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:50.500]   Rubies are far more rare than diamonds are, but yet how much value do you place on a ruby?
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.620]   You probably don't even know what a ruby looks like.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.620]   Bible said a virtuous wife who can find her worth is far above rubies.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.540]   What it was talking about, a ruby is more valuable than a diamond, but you don't know
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.540]   what a ruby looks like and you do know what a diamond looks like.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:10.220]   Well, it's this whole giant scam that the diamond industry came up with and they said,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.300]   we have a lot of diamonds, how can we sell more of them at higher prices?
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.500]   And they decided, well, we'll market them as a symbol of love.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:24.180]   Before that, they were not, and yet today they are.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:30.100]   Now, no matter how dumb, I should give more examples of how objectively dumb they are.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.620]   Ever since that time in the United States American culture, when we've embraced diamonds
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:42.460]   as the way for a man to profess his undying love and forever attention to his wife, his
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:53.180]   fiance, a prospective fiance, ever since that time, marriage has systematically declined
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.100]   in strength.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:02.700]   The giving of the diamond ring certainly never helped marriage because all the trends are
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.740]   down.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.260]   So objectively, this is dumb.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.980]   I'm trying to give a little few objective data points.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:15.500]   Yes, I'm being, speaking large and being a little bit hyperbolic, but this is really
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.300]   true.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:25.940]   And yet as a young man, you probably are better served by embracing the custom and figuring
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.940]   it out.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:34.420]   Now, I'm sure that there are young women out there who would be okay with marrying
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.340]   somebody and with becoming engaged to their fiance without a diamond ring.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.660]   I've met a few of them here and there, but much of the time, probably not.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.660]   Probably not.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.300]   I know for my wife, when I proposed to her, which by the way, another one that drives
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.420]   me nuts about the diamond ring thing.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.580]   When I was growing up as a little boy, I often thought to myself, you know what?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:05.820]   It would be so scary to be a man kneeling down, asking a woman to marry you.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.940]   What if she says no?
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:13.420]   And it wasn't until a little while before, it was in a couple of years before, I was
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:19.140]   in a position where I was actually going to propose to my wife that I realized if you're
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.380]   asking her to marry you and you don't know the answer, you better not be asking her to
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.020]   marry you.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   Not a good move.
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.700]   Hopefully, your relationship has a little bit better communication and has been a little
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.540]   bit more straightforward than that for that to be out of the blue.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.540]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.380]   There's a place for romantic notions and actions and all of that.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.380]   And if your fiance embraces that, great, go for it.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:51.620]   I certainly have sought to do that as well and to create the most romantic image possible.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.740]   But that's primarily so she can tell a story to all of her friends.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.340]   And the whole reason for a diamond is so she can feel proud to show off a ring to all of
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.340]   her friends.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   But try to do it in an intelligent way.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:06.580]   So, if you're going to embrace the fashion and conform to it, try to do it in some way
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.220]   that gives you more bang for the buck.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.420]   At this point, if I were giving advice about diamond buying to myself, I would say that
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:18.980]   I dramatically overspent on my wife's engagement ring.
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.900]   But to this day, she still loves it.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.700]   And I don't...do I regret it?
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.700]   I don't know.
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.660]   I don't...I hate that question.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.660]   She still loves it.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.100]   I bought a custom ring.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   I had it custom made by a jeweler and it was designed exactly the way that I knew she would
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.620]   want it and she loves it.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.700]   So, if you're going to do something, embrace it.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.380]   Just do it as intelligently as you can and get as many long-lasting benefits as possible.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   Same thing with clothes.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.800]   If you're going to get nice clothes, go ahead and get them.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.740]   Just buy them as smart as you can and maintain them as smart as you can if you need them
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.020]   to fit in for conformity.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.380]   And then finally with driving, if you need to drive a certain vehicle to fit in, to conform,
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.380]   do your best to drive it and enjoy it.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.620]   Try to get a good deal, but enjoy it.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.580]   If I were a new attorney, I probably would be driving some kind of car that had the luxury
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.100]   nameplate on it.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.100]   But you know what?
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.580]   They are fun to drive.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.180]   It is fun to drive a luxury car.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.820]   And so, I would try to do it smart.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.660]   I would try to get a good deal and I would try to buy used and I would try to play with
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.540]   all of the tricks, which I'll go through more in a minute.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:28.220]   But at the end of the day, enjoy it and embrace it.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.820]   Now strategy number two, find a workaround that gives you plausible deniability without
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.900]   directly confronting the specific issue at hand.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.260]   And I think this is the most powerful strategy that we should continually be thinking of.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.700]   When confronted with a peer pressure moment, when confronted with a fashion of the day,
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.020]   when confronted with the fact that we don't have stars on our tummies, try to figure out
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.740]   a way that gives you plausible deniability without directly confronting it.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.940]   Because it's very tiresome to spend all of your life working so that you can blow all
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.700]   of your money and put it into Mr. Marty McBean's pocket just so that you can fit in.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:13.100]   But it's also tiresome to constantly be confronting everything.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.180]   It's tiresome for you and it's tiresome for your friends and family.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.140]   I think at 500 episodes of the show, I don't think I've ever really ranted on diamonds.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.860]   I don't have an interest in being known as the diamond ranter.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.820]   There's a reason for that.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.580]   I don't want to be the constant anti guy.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:38.940]   There are a very few number of issues that I believe are very important and I will go
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.140]   to my death defending those issues if that's what it takes.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:50.460]   But I'm not going to waste my life energy confronting every single thing.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:57.420]   And friends, this is not a good way to live.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:05.620]   Whatever your issue of choice, whether it's politics, whether it's...
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.420]   Whatever your issue of choice, don't get yourself so many issues that you spend your entire
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.700]   life just being anti.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.660]   I was just so struck.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:21.380]   I was on Twitter last week and I look at the hashtags that are trending and something...
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.660]   And I look at there and the hashtag that was trending was nothing matters but.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.380]   That was the hashtag, nothing matters but.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.020]   Now I don't know what the source of this hashtag was, but I clicked on it.
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:36.620]   The top handful of posts were all wholeheartedly politically, political.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.480]   I took a screenshot and just listen to this.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.700]   This is from Bryce Tacky.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.460]   This was his post on Twitter.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:51.700]   Hashtag, nothing matters but impeaching Trump and Pence, imprisoning every complicit traitor,
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.860]   flipping and keeping Congress blue, electing Democrat governors, electing Dems at every
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.360]   level everywhere and holding them accountable.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.540]   And to do all this, we must resist and resist and resist.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:10.060]   The one right below that in my little screenshot, Christopher Zullo, nothing matters but electing
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.080]   a Democratic Congress in 2018.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:21.500]   If you want to destroy your life, just start actually living in accordance with these words
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.780]   saying that nothing matters but impeaching Trump and Pence, imprisoning all these people,
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.220]   flipping Congress, electing a Democratic Congress, et cetera.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:38.740]   You don't have any control over a single one of those things and your Twitter posts are
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.620]   not going to make a difference.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.460]   Now I get it.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.580]   It's Twitter, it's hyperbole, it's political Twitter, all of that.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.300]   But my friends, this is what we see every day.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:55.220]   People destroying their lives over issues they can't change while they ignore the ones
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.100]   that they can.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.140]   So whether it's politics or whether it's the fact that diamonds are a ripoff or whether
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:08.800]   it's the latest financial thing that's done or whether it's the fact that your neighbor
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:20.100]   cuts their grass too short, stop wasting your time confronting every single thing and embrace
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.580]   a few things.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.460]   Just move on.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.540]   Get some joy out of it.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:31.460]   Back to plausible deniability, finding a workaround that gives you plausible deniability without
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.460]   direct confrontations.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:38.780]   I said a moment ago, I'm just going to using my diamonds, duds and drives.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:44.540]   I said a moment ago that I bought my wife a custom engagement ring when I proposed to
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.780]   her and that was fine.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.020]   If I were going to go back and do it today, the only reason that I bought her a custom
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:54.220]   ring was because I knew she had in her head a design that she thought would be cool.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.980]   She had told me about it a few years earlier and I'd made note of it.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.980]   I'd gone home, I'd listened to her and I'd made note of it.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.900]   I'd actually gone home and drawn a picture of it, of what she had said even a few years
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.100]   before I proposed to her.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.900]   So I knew that was in her head.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.820]   But if she had never dropped something, a hint, if I'd never known that she had a desire
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:15.500]   for something interesting and custom, I would have bought her an engagement ring at Costco.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.020]   If you're shopping for an engagement ring, go to Costco.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.860]   Walmart also, but I would go to Costco.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.980]   And the reason is because it'll be easier for you to get something that is, again, plausible
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.980]   deniability.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.020]   It'd be easier for you to get a diamond that is of decent clarity, of decent quality, that's
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.380]   been graded at Costco than at Walmart because Walmart sells low-end and high-end jewelry
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.380]   as well.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.940]   Now you can learn the grading system and you can learn all of that, but go to Costco.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   Spend the money.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.980]   Get something that's fairly valued, that's pretty inexpensive and it gives you what you
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:54.620]   need, the diamond ring, without directly confronting and telling your fiance, "I'm not going to
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:30:01.020]   give you a diamond ring because that just fits into the giant scheme and scam that is
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.140]   engagement rings."
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   It's simpler.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.300]   Saves you money, gets you in there, get much closer to wholesale than retail.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.460]   Now with your clothes, my encouragement is if you need them, find some way of working
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.100]   around it.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:24.980]   So perhaps in your environment, a suit is optional, but maybe you can get by with a
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:28.340]   shirt and tie and a coat.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:35.880]   For a number of years when I was a financial advisor, I wore suits, but I came to realize
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.140]   that suits in Florida are a scam.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.580]   Again, the origin of suits for men was that these were primarily workable, useful clothes
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.940]   that protected you from being cold.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.580]   Same thing with academic robes.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.380]   If you're in academia, you got to buy these crazy expensive robes to wear twice a year.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.020]   Well, the point of academic robes, they were a practical feature.
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.300]   It was something that professors wore to keep them warm while they were in the bowels of
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.340]   the dungeon that they worked in.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.420]   It was 50 degrees down there and that was a way that they kept warm.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.940]   Well, that fashion became something that was a way of expressing superiority and expressing
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   their status.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.500]   Okay, if you become a PhD and you're a professor at a college, you got to buy your crazy $750
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.580]   robe and your fancy hat that shows and all of the academic regalia that you wear a couple
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.220]   three times a year.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.340]   So same thing with suits.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.780]   Wool suits became the fashion, but they used to be a practical thing.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.300]   You didn't have zippers, you had buttons.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.260]   You had a coat, it was woven a little bit more finely, it kept you warm, and then that
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:42.660]   became the fashion so that now in Florida, you have people that walk around in wool suits
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.860]   in Florida or polyester suits, even worse, and that's what's expected in the business
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.140]   environment where it's 90 degrees and dripping wet.
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:57.420]   Well, interesting, my workaround for that is embrace Spanish fashion.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.660]   I couldn't get away with this as a financial advisor, but one of the workarounds that I
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.700]   would do is just wear a pair of linen pants or a pair of khaki pants and a guayabera and
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.140]   a straw hat and embrace that and you can get around most of it.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:15.640]   If you go and you look at a picture of assembled dignitaries and presidents of a South American
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.140]   or a Central American group, you'll find that 50% of them are wearing a guayabera as their
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140]   shirt.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.880]   It works perfectly fine if you're in Miami as well.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.140]   Now the other workaround would be something like wearing khaki pants and a blazer.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.980]   I found that I could wear khaki pants and a shirt and a blazer and I would have multiple
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.260]   advantages from that.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:41.580]   Number one, it pulled back a little bit on the sharkness of my look.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:50.180]   I never got why financial advisors dressed like sharks with glittering French cuff pins
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.940]   and stick pins in their ties and all of that.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.660]   They look like they're the next whoever that guy was from the Wall Street movie, the next
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:02.820]   wolf of Wall Street, ready to steal all their client's money.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.460]   There was a little bit more advantage of looking like an accountant than looking like a shark,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.900]   but it also had the advantage of being cheaper.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.900]   Look for something like that.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.300]   Now beyond that, fashion advice, I don't have any solution for you, but look around and
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:20.980]   try to figure out, is there a workaround wherein I can get what I need to get without trying
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:25.100]   to just directly confront this and wear jeans every day?
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.580]   Similar thing with what you drive.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.220]   Try to drive something that doesn't neatly fit categorization.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.340]   I'll give you my secret solutions.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.580]   Number one, Toyota Prius.
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:43.700]   If you work in an industry where fancy cars are expected, buy a Prius because mostly people
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:51.780]   will think that you're a greenie weenie environmentalist and they won't ask if you really are.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:58.300]   So you can pull in a crowd of Mercedes and BMWs and a Prius and nobody will think twice
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.580]   about it.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.860]   It's not a poor person's car.
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.660]   It's an environmentalist's car.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:05.140]   It's great.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.180]   Or an SUV.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.220]   That was what I wound up when I was a financial advisor.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.500]   I was wrestling through these questions and I actually wrote an email to Tom Stanley,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.220]   author of The Millionaire Next Door and a bunch of books that I appreciated on marketing
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.100]   the affluent, selling to the affluent.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:24.900]   And I relayed to him my woes and I said, "Dr. Stanley, I need to buy a car and I work with
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.260]   wealthy people, but I don't want to buy a Mercedes."
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.100]   And he wrote back and he said, "Buy a full-size SUV."
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:37.740]   Vast majority of wealthy households have a Chevy Suburban or GMC equivalent of that and
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:42.300]   many of them also have a Ford Expedition, have that in their driveway.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.300]   It worked.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.620]   Bought a Ford Expedition.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.860]   Never worried about how I looked.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   Worked great.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.340]   Same thing with a minivan or something.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:55.020]   If you buy a minivan, people will think, "Oh, you got kids."
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.940]   So look for a way to drive something that doesn't neatly fit categorization.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.860]   Or of course, there are many other ways.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.860]   Maybe you drive a Toyota 4Runner.
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.460]   Well, go ahead and put a nice roof rack on it and strap some unnecessary doodads to the
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.700]   front and back bumper, make it look like you spend your weekend overlanding in the Sierra
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:16.940]   Nevada mountains and going to Moab and people will just think, "Well, that's just your thing."
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.940]   Or drive an old Tacoma or something like that.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.860]   Find a way to mix it up a little bit.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:29.320]   What you don't want to do is drive a broken down Ford or American sedan that makes you
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.460]   look poor.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.300]   You got to find something that gets you out of that categorization.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.780]   So look around and think about something that you would be into that'll do the job and give
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:49.020]   you plausible deniability without trying to just directly confront it.
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.580]   That's strategy number two.
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.500]   Or strategy number three.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.300]   Go ahead and embrace your confrontational spirit and engage in direct confrontation
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.020]   with the fashion of the day.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.140]   Now maybe this is you.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.140]   This isn't really me.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.940]   I'm more prone to worrying about what people think of me than that.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.540]   But if this is you, go for it.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.460]   If you want to get back at the De Beers family for the giant scam that they've waged upon
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.340]   the world, go for it.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.340]   And guess what?
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:27.220]   If that's you, you'll probably attract a fiance who's willing to put up with your funny ways.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   That's fine.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   Go for it.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.220]   She's probably a gem.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.460]   But stake your claim and own it.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.740]   If you want to come against it with the clothes, stake your claim and own it.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:37.860]   Dress like a rock star.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.100]   Dress like a cowboy.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.100]   Dress like a hoodlum.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.220]   Whatever, I don't know, whatever it is, pick it out.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.860]   And if you want to be that one who just says, "No, frugality is important to me," go for
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.860]   it.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:57.560]   Now this is, I think, really best done in an area where you can prove your worth objectively.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.580]   And here I'm thinking of somebody like an NFL star.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.660]   From time to time you'll read about these sports people, whether it's an NFL star or
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.700]   an NBA player or somebody like that.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.700]   Who knows?
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.580]   NFL is the most important because the average NFL career length is tiny.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.580]   If memory is right, it's something like three and a half years.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.820]   So the average NFL career length is really, really small.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:27.780]   And so if you go into the NFL, speaking statistically, you better be prepared for a three and a half
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.060]   year career.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:34.780]   That means you better not blow all your money signing up for a big hairy mortgage.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:39.300]   Now when you become a superstar, and especially if you're a superstar in a career track where
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.860]   you can be a long-lived superstar, go for it.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.660]   If you're a Tom Brady or if you're another quarterback where you can have these long
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.100]   careers, that's great.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.140]   But the average NFL player is only going to have a few years of earning.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:57.060]   And so from time to time you'll read a story about so-and-so in the NFL drives a Toyota
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.100]   Camry, the same Toyota Camry they went into college with and they drive it and park it.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.100]   Guess what?
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:11.260]   You can only do that effectively if you're in a career where your performance is going
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.860]   to be measured by some other standard.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.500]   And that's why it works for an NFL player.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.460]   It all comes down to how many yards did you run the ball or how many plays did you pass
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.620]   or how many defensive plays were you able to make.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.980]   That works.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.980]   The president of your team, the owner of the team, the coaches, they don't care what kind
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.840]   of car you drive.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.700]   They care how effective you are on the field.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.980]   And so go ahead and embrace that frugal, zany person.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   "Oh, you know, this is Joshua.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:44.140]   He's the guy that drives the Camry, isn't he so funny?"
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.540]   But we'd go to him on the weekends and ask him for financial advice.
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.040]   That's cool.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.300]   Where that doesn't work and where you should be a little bit slow giving advice to other
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.380]   people is you should be a little slow giving advice to other people if their careers are
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.420]   different.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:01.540]   So back to the worst example, best example, the attorney, the attorney that drives around
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:07.660]   in the broken down looking car, the old Toyota Camry, is probably going to be thought of
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.080]   to be a not very good attorney because it's hard to see the win-loss record and the number
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   of passes.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.500]   Now, if that attorney has succeeded in staking their claim with some big wins, they're the
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:24.420]   ones who beat the giant chemical company and they're the environmentalist who drives the
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   old car because they beat the giant chemical company, that's one thing.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:32.140]   Or if they're the attorney that has a long string of victories and successes and this
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.380]   is just their weird thing, that's fine.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.100]   But if you're just getting started and you don't have those things, then you got to pay
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.540]   attention to what the signaling, the signaling that you're doing, the signaling theory.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.180]   Got to pay attention.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.380]   And so if you can stake your claim, go for it.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.260]   Now, here would be a flip side.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:56.520]   If you're going to engage in direct contradiction, confrontation of the prevailing situation,
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.980]   do it in a way that fits a brand that you're trying to achieve.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:10.340]   A good example here would be my friend Alan Moore, the co-founder of the XY Planning Network.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.260]   The first, well, I've never seen him in anything else, I guess.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:19.540]   But whenever I've met Alan Moore, he's always wearing jeans, Chacos, and an XY Planning
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.540]   Network t-shirt.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:28.180]   Now, that fits his brand because primarily he's involved in marketing to other financial
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.200]   advisors who he wants to enjoy to fit to come and join his firm.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.580]   And so he can wear his t-shirt and basically he's marketing to young people and saying,
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.620]   "Hey, if you're a young financial advisor and you want to come and work with other younger
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.700]   clients, come and join us.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.380]   And look, I'll wear my t-shirt and this is the way that we can be.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.260]   We don't have to wear the stuffy suit and shirt culture."
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:57.140]   And so it's a direct marketing scheme that's pushing back against the stuffiness or the
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:01.220]   perceived stuffiness of the financial planning industry.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.700]   So you can embrace that.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   I recently stumbled across a guy who all he does is he's a lawyer, but he exclusively
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:16.460]   defends in firearms-related cases.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:23.420]   And so his image is he went ahead and he's got all the tactical gear and all the clothing
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:28.380]   and that stuff, and he's not wearing a shirt and tie because he's trying to be very clear
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.740]   that this is what I do.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.140]   I'm not doing criminal defense on the weekend and doing a little bit of tax fraud cases
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.140]   here and there.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.500]   I'm just doing firearms stuff.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.300]   And so he embraced the tactical look.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.660]   And you can do that.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.980]   You can do that.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.180]   Just think carefully about it.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.580]   If you look at it, what you'll find is that when people who engage in direct confrontation
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:56.520]   of the fashion, the reason they're successful is because it's part of their overall brand.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:03.100]   Why did rock stars embrace long hair or weird face paint or doing their shows from the stage
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:06.780]   naked or wearing leather pants?
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.380]   That's because it was countercultural.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.620]   They're trying to push back against the stuffiness.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:17.700]   That works as attraction for a time.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:22.740]   But you can't be an accountant at the big four accounting firm and think that showing
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.860]   up to work in a pair of tight leather pants and no shirt is going to advance your career.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.460]   It's simply not.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.820]   And frankly, I think if your work is an accountant and you exclusively work with rock star clients,
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:43.900]   I don't think it'll help your career if you show up for your next meeting with Gene Simmons
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.420]   wearing your leather pants.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.460]   It's fine for the rock star to do that.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.300]   But when they want an accountant, they want an accountant.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.740]   If you're going to go and sell books on how to fight with the IRS and you're going to
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.540]   do seminars, well now go ahead and embrace your rock star nature.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:07.700]   If you're going to have a radical brand, go for it.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.340]   But you've got to sell it all the way through.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.500]   So if you're going to engage in direct confrontation, do it, but do it very advisedly.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.140]   That's my point.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:23.220]   See a lot of times what bothers me when people analyze things is they ignore what in my mind
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.700]   is proven and settled.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:32.300]   That people care what you wear and they care what you do and they care how you act.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.520]   I believe that's true.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.580]   Maybe people shouldn't care what you wear, but the fact is they do.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.700]   Maybe they shouldn't judge you by the way you dress and by the way that you speak, but
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.500]   the fact is that they do.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:54.700]   And wishing it were otherwise doesn't make it so.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.300]   You might wish that you were someone that you're not, but wishing it doesn't make you
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.380]   someone else.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.140]   You are you.
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:05.880]   And so in all these things, being countercultural only works if you're in an area where that
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.020]   counterculturality is going to be useful.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.380]   And so think carefully about it.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:19.340]   If you can be measured by some objective performance or if you can use your desire to engage in
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.620]   wearing leather pants in the office and you can do that as part of your brand, go for
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.620]   it.
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.900]   But you better make sure that your prospective targeted customer will actually appreciate
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   your leather pants.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:38.140]   When it comes to the face paint, I don't know how to advise you on that.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.700]   When it comes to the strategies and the fashions of the day, those are my three strategies
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.300]   for them and think through them.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.100]   Now it's not just about your diamonds and your duds and your drives.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.540]   It's not just about your cars and your clothes.
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:53.200]   If I'd have been able to come up with a C word for diamond, I would be carrots.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.900]   That's what I should have done.
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.820]   The carrots and your clothes and your cars.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.820]   Cars, clothes, and carrots.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.740]   Oops, if I'd thought a little longer, I would have come up with my alliteration around the
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.540]   letter C. It's not that those are the only three things.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.460]   I'm just trying to give you examples.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.980]   So when you look at something that you need to do in your business and in your life, think
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.180]   about it and then think through which strategy am I going to engage in.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.940]   Do I conform to the fashion, even though it's dumb, just so I can enjoy the acceptance by
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:24.020]   my group and then go ahead and move forward with my personal goals?
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.940]   It's not a wrong choice.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:39.140]   If I grew up in the hood, in the inner city, I would wear baggy jeans and oversized clothes
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:44.140]   until I got out of the hood and I would carry a backpack and change my clothes on the bus
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.340]   or in the public restroom until I got to my job.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.000]   And on the way home, I would change them again on the way home until I could afford to move
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.220]   out of the hood.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:46:00.820]   It's not stupid to not get picked on because you don't match.
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.460]   What's stupid would be to be late to your job because all your buddies in the hood are
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:12.020]   picking on you and being bullies to you because you don't wear baggy clothes.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:16.340]   So sometimes conform to the fashion, dumb as it is, so you can enjoy acceptance by the
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.500]   group around you and further your personal goals.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:25.900]   Number two, find a workaround that gives you plausible deniability without direct confrontation.
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.220]   This I think is the sweet spot.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:34.020]   Spend most of your time, if you think about it, in almost every area, there's a workaround.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:42.180]   And number three, engage in direct confrontation of the fashion, but do it very advisedly.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180]   Be careful.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:48.980]   There are some people who are megastar athletes or who are megastar rock stars or who are
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:53.580]   megastar actors or who are megastar accountants.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:59.620]   And because of their ability to prove their megastar-ness, people will put up with their
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.980]   antics.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:07.560]   But if you're not a megastar, they may not put up with yours.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:13.140]   The antics aren't the causal factor in success.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:21.260]   It's the megastar-ness or the ability to demonstrate megastar capability that leads to success.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.660]   As we close, remember, you know what?
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.700]   I should do this without the music.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:37.540]   As we close, let me read to you again just these few paragraphs from the Dr. Seuss story.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.000]   Just because it, and think about this now that I'm done with my show on strategies.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.020]   Think about this now in the context of just the silliness of our society and the silliness
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.940]   of our spending.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:57.500]   Then quickly, Sylvester McMonkey McBean put together a very peculiar machine.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.900]   And he said, "You want stars like a star belly snitch?
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:05.500]   My friends, you can have them for $3 each.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.540]   Just pay me your money and hop right aboard."
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.860]   So they clamored inside.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.860]   Then the big machine roared.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.740]   And it clonked and it bonked and it jerked and it burked and it bopped them about.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.740]   But the thing really worked.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.500]   When the plain belly snitches popped out, they had stars.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.840]   They actually did.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.500]   They had stars upon thars.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.460]   Then they yelled at the ones who had stars from the start.
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.580]   "We're exactly like you, you can't tell us apart.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.220]   We're all just the same now, you snooty old smarties.
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.580]   And now we can go to your Frankfurter parties."
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.740]   "Good grief!" groaned the ones who had stars at the first.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.580]   "We're still the best snitches and they are the worst.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:49.920]   But now how in the world will we know they all frowned if which kind is what or the other
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.980]   way round?"
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:56.100]   Then up came McBean with a very sly wink.
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.940]   And he said, "Things are not quite as bad as you think.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.020]   So you don't know who's who.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.140]   That is perfectly true.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.060]   But come with me, friends.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.860]   Do you know what I'll do?
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:18.780]   I'll make you again the best snitches on beaches and all it will cost you is ten dollars each."
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.020]   "Belly stars are no longer in style," said McBean.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.860]   "What you need is a trip through my star-off machine.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:33.380]   This wondrous contraption will take off your stars so you won't look like snitches who
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.740]   have them on thars."
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:42.260]   And that handy machine, working very precisely, removed all the stars from their tummies quite
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.260]   nicely.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:46.980]   Then, with snoots in the air, they paraded about.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.500]   And they opened their beaks and they let out a shout, "We know who is who.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.940]   Now there isn't a doubt.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.900]   The best kind of snitches are snitches without."
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:00.900]   Then, of course, those with stars all got frightfully mad.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:05.700]   To be wearing a star now was frightfully bad.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:13.620]   And of course, old Sylvester McMonkey McBean invited them into his star-off machine.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:21.100]   Then of course, from then on, as you probably guess, things really got into a horrible mess.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:27.420]   All the rest of that day and that century, on those wild screaming beaches, the Fix-It-Up
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.180]   Chappy kept fixing up snitches.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:34.260]   Off again, on again, in again, out again.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:39.780]   Through the machines, they raced round and about again, changing their stars every minute
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.940]   or two.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.760]   They kept paying money.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.980]   They kept running through, until neither the plane nor the star bellies knew whether this
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.540]   one was that one or that one was this one or which one was what one or what one was
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.860]   who.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:51:06.060]   Then, when every last cent of their money was spent, the Fix-It-Up Chappy packed up
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.300]   and he went.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.220]   And he laughed as he drove in his car up the beach.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.060]   They never will learn.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:22.300]   No, you can't teach a snitch.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:31.420]   This is a story that's about to change your life.
