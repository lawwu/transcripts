[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   People rely too much on TurboTax.
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.880]   I view it as if you need your grass cut, right?
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.200]   Like you don't say like, well, the lawnmower took care of it.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.380]   Like you're the lawnmower, like you literally are taking the
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.120]   tool and cutting your grass.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.020]   I think it's an assessment, ideally, you know, an unbiased
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.940]   assessment of your own skills, right?
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.400]   Some people just have no business preparing their return.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.620]   Even if it's on the simpler side, they will find a way to mess it up.
[00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.680]   Just not their thing, being timely.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.140]   There's benefits to a preparer beyond the actual knowledge, right?
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.620]   A lot of times it's like peace of mind, it's just timeliness.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.740]   Like it's actually just going to get done.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.140]   So assessing your own skills.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.540]   And then at that point, I mean, TurboTax is great for whenever you've
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.100]   got clear tax documents that just need to be input, it will do it perfectly.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.900]   I think when, when it's W-2 stuff, like TurboTax is great.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.100]   And if anything, they're better than hiring someone who doesn't care about
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.860]   their return as much as you care about your return, but once you start
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.580]   going into business or if you're taking any specific tax positions, I would
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.720]   just find someone that knows what they're doing.
