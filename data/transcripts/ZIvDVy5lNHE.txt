[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   Look at John Quincy Adams here.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.520]   Yeah. Hey, Quincy, how you doing?
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.880]   That hair. Look at that hair.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.280]   John Quincy Adams needed a wig to achieve this look.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.240]   He did. He did.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.600]   I did it all natural.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000]   I mean, it's a lot. It's a look.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.320]   You're like some movie star from the 1970s who's still working. Do me a favor,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.000]   pull up a picture of Graydon Carter for a second and then put that side by side with Sax.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.880]   Let's see. Just zoom in on that. Sax, this is where you're headed, by the way.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.240]   You're headed to crazy town.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.880]   This is where you're headed. You can just poof it out on the sides and you get a little
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.480]   woof swoop on the top.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   Crazy town.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   This is where you're headed. Eccentric Sax. Pull up a picture of Steve Bannon's hair.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   He's a wise statesman.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   I think this is what happens when you get too close to power.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.000]   You get more eccentric with your hair. So like too much power equals crazy hair. Now, look,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.480]   this is my theory. Graydon Carter, too much power, vanity fair. He went hair crazy. Now you look at
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.960]   Bannon, you get me a Bannon photo here, you start to see they go longer, they go wafty.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.080]   They just they get volume and they're just like, fuck it. I'm just I'm not going to cut it. I'm
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.720]   going to let it go wild. And of course, the old I mean, he's the penultimate. But you look at
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560]   Trump's hair. This is where it gets truly crazy. This is where you're headed, Sax.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.360]   You keep getting this close to power. This is where your hair is headed.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.600]   >>Sam: I'm so glad this podcast never broke up because where would we get this amazing
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.000]   insight from J Cal if not for keeping this all together? This makes it all worth it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.040]   It's very true.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280]   >>Corey: It is true. You get like eccentric and you get crazy hair. This is men get too
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.760]   close to power. And the hair gets wild, unchecked power, unchecked hair.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.200]   >>Sam: We had a good meeting last night.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.480]   >>Corey: We had an all in summit meeting. I said, Freeberg, give me a call. Let's catch
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   up on this stuff. He's like, I'm in the bath right now with my candles. And I'm like,
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.040]   yeah, okay, whatever. That's cool. He's like, no, no. And he presses the video button.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.520]   And then I'm exposed. I kid you not to the most bubbles I've ever seen in a bubble bath.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.320]   >>Sam: I like bubbles.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.280]   >>Corey: And he is peeking his head out from over the bubbles. And he's like, look.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.840]   >>Sam: Which head?
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.320]   >>Corey: Exactly. And then he flips the camera around and I got his toes pointing out. And I
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.200]   kid you not, there's six candles around the bathtub. I'm like, this is like the prince
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.680]   of panic attacks. He had to come down for his phone call with me. So now when he has a phone
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.520]   call with me, it's so intense and everything's getting so intense with the summit that he has to
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.480]   do self care.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.640]   >>Sam: Yeah. I had to be emotionally ready.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.920]   >>Corey: He's self caring.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000]   >>Kyle: Your wife wasn't anywhere to be found. This is you in the bathtub with the candles.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.280]   >>Sam: I take a bath every night.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.520]   >>Kyle: Who are you romancing? Yourself or what?
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.840]   >>Sam: Yeah.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.240]   >>Corey: I think he was romancing the spreadsheet with the profit line of all in summit.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400]   >>Sam: I have about 18 minutes of self care every day.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.560]   >>Corey: 18 seconds, man. All right. Let's get the show started in three, two.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:03:03.520]   [intro music]
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   Hey, everybody, welcome to episode 130, maybe of the all in podcast. We're still here. Cooking
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.280]   with oil with me, of course, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, Prince of Panic,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.960]   Attack Sultan of Science, the Queen of Kinwa, David Friedberg, and the power broker himself,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.040]   the emperor, David Sachs, the emperor of his new republic. Anybody have any interest,
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.000]   anything going on interesting this week? Any interesting moments for people on the national
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.400]   stage? No? Okay, well, let's get right into the docket. First around the docket, Ron DeSantis,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Governor Ron DeSantis announced his bid on the internet on something called Twitter Spaces. And
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.600]   it looks like almost 10 million viewers have seen it so far across all the different spaces. And
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.000]   Donald Trump wasn't too pleased. He said, Rob, my big red button is bigger, better, stronger,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.240]   and it's working. Truth. Because when Elon fired up the Twitter Spaces, it went to 650,000 viewers
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.440]   in under five minutes, and then blew up everybody's phones. My phone was melting, I could have cooked
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.560]   an egg on the back of it. The Twitter app crashed so many times. But then Sachs, with his meager
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   following of a half million people or something, then restarted the stream. And so 15 minutes of
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.880]   technical snafus were relieved. And then there was a announcement. And I'll let you take it from
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.640]   there, Sachs. You want me to take you behind the scenes? Take us behind the scenes. Take us behind
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.440]   the scenes. How did it come together, Sachs? Oh, yeah, even better. Yeah, the way it came together
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.560]   is I think the DeSantis team were interested in potentially, you know, doing something different
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.920]   for their announcement. He also did an appearance on Fox News afterwards. And I think he did a town
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.400]   hall. But I think they saw an opportunity to break new ground here in terms of presidential
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.200]   announcements by doing it on Twitter Spaces. And so the DeSantis campaign connected with Twitter.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   And Elon and I agreed to kind of co-host the space with him. And he did his announcement. Now,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.720]   you're right, we had about 15 minutes of technical difficulties, because the interest
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   was so intense. At the time, the room crashed, it had over 700,000 people in it. And there were
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   it crashed because so many people were trying to get in it. I think there was well over a million
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.120]   people trying to get in it. So you normally don't have this kind of interest. I think this is by far
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.960]   the biggest Twitter space. The engineers there told me that the previous order of magnitude was
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.920]   more like 100,000, not a million. And then you combine that with the fact that Elon's account
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.040]   has over 100 million followers. And that basically led to a new level of scale. And you guys understand
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.120]   that when you get to a new level of scale, as a platform, there's always going to be some
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.280]   challenges. So in any event, the engineers were there trying to figure out how do we solve this.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.440]   And we realized the simplest thing to do would just be to restart the room on my account instead
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.960]   of Elon's. And then Elon joins a co-host and we brought DeSantis in. And it all worked perfectly
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.120]   at that point. The audio was brisk. We had over 300,000 people in the room. There was also another
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   room that had been set up by Mario Nawal, who's like a big Twitter spaces host. And he had hundreds
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.280]   of thousands of people in there. And then he had live commentary from people he invited. And so
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.720]   this ability to fork Twitter spaces into many different rooms, and each room gets to decide
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.280]   who they want to be their host and their speakers, allows you to do live commentary and
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.200]   in a way that you could never have done before. So it was really innovative, I think.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.640]   Super innovative. And for people who don't know, Twitter spaces was really a rush job at Twitter.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.040]   They did that in reaction to Clubhouse. It's still basically a beta product
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.240]   that predates Elon being there. And it doesn't have yet the infrastructure or scale of the
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.920]   codebase, I don't think, like YouTube and Twitch do, which, you know, have been working on this
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.120]   problem for, I don't know, 15 years. Maybe the live products? I have two observations.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.360]   The first is I thought DeSantis did a really good job just rolling with the punches.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.720]   Okay.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.880]   Because I think whether he wins, you're not going to look back on this moment as the
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.120]   defining moment of the campaign, nor whether he loses, will you say that this was
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:33.280]   where it was it all the beginning of the end. Instead, what this was, it was a really
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.880]   seminal moment, I think, in further divorcing ourselves away from the mainstream media.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:48.320]   And you know that it was that important because Biden tried to troll the whole thing,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.640]   Nick, you can show this link. This link works. And I actually think this is a really terrible
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.960]   idea by the Biden team, because never responded basically acknowledges how important the moment
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.080]   was. And the fact that even the President of the United States was grinding the link
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:12.480]   and couldn't get in because there was so much interest is really important. And I think what
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.920]   it speaks to is the fact that we are now showing credibly that you don't need to listen to four
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   channels to shape your consciousness. And you can just go straight to the source. And what
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:34.800]   SAC said is right, if you now have a moderated forum, that then gets put out to 50 or 60 different
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.120]   Twitter spaces all at the same time, framing and reframing, it gives people a chance to come to
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:49.200]   their own conclusion in a totally unique way. So I think it was really, really an important moment
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:57.520]   for citizen journalism, and podcasting and audio formats and all of the things that I think we've
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.720]   been a small part of. But I think that it's really must have tilted the mainstream media and it
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.600]   tilted the establishment. And you can see that in Biden's tweet. Yeah, going direct. Yeah. So that
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.720]   was the first thing. Second thing. I think DeSantis did a really decent job in rolling with
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   the whole thing and being super cool and just being committed to the process. And I think that says a
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.400]   lot about him as well, which was again, it's a question mark. And I've said this before,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:31.280]   the big money guys got close and then took a step back. So this could be a very good moment for them
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.600]   to reevaluate because I thought he did a very good job. So I agree. So you know, I was there,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.920]   I was live, I was seeing what was happening behind the scenes. When DeSantis came on after we,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.160]   you know, had 15 minutes of technical difficulties. There wasn't a hint of anger,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.080]   there wasn't a trace of irritation, there wasn't any freaking out that we were potentially ruining
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.320]   his presidential announcement, the guy was completely calm. And more than that,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.560]   he was in good spirits. I mean, if you listen to the recording, you know, he's happy.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.600]   His tone was great.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.280]   His tone was really good. I mean, and then of course, it was very substantive. He spoke
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.280]   in a very articulate way about all the issues. When Congressman Thomas Massie came on to make a
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   comment or question, he was telling a kind of amusing anecdote about when they were in Congress
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   together. And Massie was one of the only members of Congress who had a Tesla, but he comes from
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.400]   Kentucky. So I think his license plate said Kentucky coal on it. KY coal. So anyway, you know,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.040]   the guy was in good spirits. And so I think it does say a lot about what he would be like as a
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.720]   president, cool under fire, doesn't get thrown off his game. You know, again, not an angry guy,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.880]   you know, which I think will be a real contrast with let's say some of the other people in the
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.560]   race. You know, Trump was sort of angrily truthing during the whole thing, you know, so I think it
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   was a pretty strong contrast.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.400]   Truthing the act of posting to Truth Social.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.520]   Exactly. So the contrast between the personalities could not have been stronger. Now,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.880]   to the other point, Chamath, about the traditional media, you're right about what they were saying.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.160]   If you look at that, the headlines this morning from traditional media outlets that really started
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:15.040]   within minutes of the technical difficulties, the New York Times called the announcement a fiasco,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.920]   NBC News called it a meltdown, Politico called it horrendous. And you know, why? I mean, if you
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:29.440]   You know what I call that? Winning. I mean, if they are losing their cool, that's clearly they
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.760]   feel threatened by the fact that a major presidential candidate chose to go direct.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.160]   Or even the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal headline is DeSantis looks to rebound
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.080]   after botched Twitter announcement. But again, what they failed to acknowledge is, and I'm not
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.080]   a DeSantis supporter per se, I'm open minded to him, but I haven't decided one way or the other.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.160]   But this is a guy that managed to get millions of people in a nanosecond to be activated to hear
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.880]   what he had to say. That is different than basically giving talking points and having surrogates
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:05.200]   lather through Fox or CNBC or CNN to hundreds of 1000s of people. This is a really important
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.720]   moment. I think what happened, right? We got all the positive just to finish that point.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.960]   So if this was a political rally, a traditional political rally that started 20 minutes late,
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.800]   would anybody have said that was a disaster that happens all the time?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.880]   No, it was the crashing that made people be like, Oh, my phone crashed. You know,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.480]   I was using the app, I got crashed out of the app, but I had my phone did not crash.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.800]   So yeah, that's what I'm saying. The app crashed a couple of times because
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.360]   the app crashed, your phone did not crash. Yeah. But any event look, this was at the end of the
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.960]   day, this was a an event that started 20 minutes late. Once we started on my Twitter account in my
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   Twitter space, it worked perfectly. There was no problem. And that's the recording that you can go
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:46.720]   on Twitter now and listen to. We had about 300,000 people contemporaneously in my Twitter space,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.840]   I think Mario had a couple 100,000. But if you look at the numbers today, there's already 10
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:58.640]   million views for this thing. By the way, three to 10 million on the replay. And that's what you
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.280]   have to look at replay because the world has moved to asynchronous like this was three o'clock in the
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:10.480]   afternoon in Silicon Valley and six o'clock. When was it in the afternoon, in the afternoon,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.400]   so you have a hysterical overreaction by the traditional media, simply don't like a that
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.040]   Elon is disremediating them by letting the politicians go direct and then be he's restored
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.520]   the platform being a free speech platform. So they jumped on this the first second they could
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.920]   try and portray as a disaster. But, you know, there was an article in political this morning,
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.640]   and they were asking voters in Iowa what they think about it. And they're like, what, you know,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.040]   it's not, it's an elite thing. It's not, it's not even on the radar. freeberg, we heard all the
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.960]   positive here. Any constructive feedback on it or thoughts on it generally? No, I mean,
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.480]   I would love to see all the political candidates engage in long form discussion like this,
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   so that an audience can really get a sense of who they are and what they think in a direct way and
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.960]   an uninterrupted way. And in a deeper way, sort of like the conversation we all had with RFK last
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.680]   week and sacked it with DeSantis yesterday. And I would love for the voters who engage in that
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.760]   content to better understand the candidates rather than key off of short talking points and short
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.320]   ads. I think one of the saddest commentaries on modern democracy is that you can spend $1 to buy
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.440]   a vote, that all of these campaigns functionally try and raise capital to go and do advertising
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.720]   and that the advertising creates these little 30 second soundbites that actually change people's
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.920]   opinions. And it's a really sad it will it they did otherwise they wouldn't spend the money.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.160]   And I think it's a really sad state of affairs that we spend money to change people's opinions
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.200]   by shortening everything to a soundbite. Instead of doing what maybe would have happened a long
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   time ago, you know, we often talk about the town square if you lived in a village with 60 people,
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.920]   and someone was going to run for the mayor of that village, you'd all go to the town square,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.000]   you'd hear that person have a debate, have a discussion, you talk with them. And that dialogue
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.720]   would inform your decision about who you're going to vote for. But you know, with 300 million people
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.240]   in this country, and you know, short attention spans and jumping around from one thing to another,
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.720]   there aren't a lot of great forums for any of us to really engage with candidates, particularly on
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.120]   the national level, and make a better informed decision hearing from that person directly.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.680]   Instead, everything is about driving narrative and chopping things up and getting the soundbite
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.000]   and driving the emotional reaction. And I think one of the greatest things that's happening right
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.120]   now, that, you know, could be a great benefit for this modern democracy is the sort of stuff
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.000]   that we've been doing on our podcast and RFK coming on board, like last week, and what Saks
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   did with Twitter. And I really hope that more politicians do that and that more people engage
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.720]   and consume that sort of content to make their decision and ignore the idiotic soundbites and
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.760]   the stupid 30 second ads and the nonsense that, you know, third parties use to try and drive
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   narrative. So yeah, look, I mean, I think that's generally the positive trend that,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.800]   that I took away from it. Jake, what do you think?
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.520]   I have some notes for Saks. I'm always, you know, careful not to be too critical,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.160]   you know, in the moment, because I don't people will weaponize them and say, Oh, Jason said this,
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.960]   because, you know, it's Elon and he's team Elon, or he's friends with Saks. But I think
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.840]   everything said so far, this tweak the media, a great start. The thing that I think was there
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.080]   were probably one or two misses here that I think you can build on Saks since you're very involved
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:38.400]   in the campaign with DeSantis. I think it wasn't the free for all that Elon had said it would have
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.200]   been right. So he pitched it as like, hey, this is going to be uncensored. And everybody's going
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.960]   to get to ask hard questions. And that didn't happen. And you know, I think that is in stark
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.600]   contrast to what Trump did, because I was doing the media analysis of this. And so I think the
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.720]   follow up needs to be where he actually takes questions, not from fans, not from people who
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.120]   are already voting for him, but really, you know, a little bit more of the cantankerous people,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.560]   the people who maybe are voting for Trump, the people who are maybe in the biting camp. And
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:15.360]   that's what was the masterstroke Trump's CNN town hall, he went into the, you know, the lions,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.000]   then or what most people perceive was going to be the lions then. And he took on all comers,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.280]   he fought hard. And that one was, I think, a bigger win. I don't think DeSantis
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.400]   was not a presidential announcement. So just to be clear, yes,
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.800]   this was a launch event declaring that he's running. So in that context,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   yeah, so you want to compare it to what these things usually are, which is a guy standing at
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.320]   a podium. Yes, in front of his supporters. Compared to that, this was much more interesting,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.080]   dynamic and engaging. I agree with you that at some point, he's going to step into the lions
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.800]   den do a town hall on a place like CNN. And I think he probably will. In fact, I think he did.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.880]   Yeah, I think he did a town hall or here. I think he actually did a town hall in Florida
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.200]   later that night. So yeah, I agree with you. It just wasn't that kind of event. Now,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.240]   to the point about involving more people, you know, one of the things I learned hosting this
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.160]   thing is there were literally 1000s of people raising their hands. Yes, you can't start
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.800]   scrolling through this in real time in the app. I wanted to call them more people. But it was just
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.120]   there was no way to do it. This is something at scale, they need to add to the interface, which is
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.440]   maybe pre populating a list, sorting it by the number of followers, whatever. And this is my
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.280]   second point about this. So I agree with you. As an announcement, this was light speed ahead
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.240]   as like a full court, you know, like sharp elbow thing. It didn't hit that note, but it can. And
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.600]   that's what I think the follow up, you know, having if to Santa's wants to come here and have
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.360]   like a two hour discussion, we kind of get into it a little more, that would be I think, really
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.120]   good for him. Because I think he's got the potential to win over moderates. And I don't
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.280]   think this one over moderates didn't win over anybody who was in, you know, the left or in the
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.680]   moderate left. And that was one of the things I noticed is my second point about it is what a
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:02.080]   great group of listeners, if you look at who showed up to listen, Bill Ackman, Michael Dell,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.800]   because you know, it's
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.440]   already see you know, you want you sourced by your followers. So
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.720]   but I think it's sorted by the number of followers they have,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   it's sorted by your followers who then have the most followers. So you're gonna see it's a bit of
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.280]   a echo chamber that way. Okay, feature.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.320]   Okay, sure. But they were still very prominent people in the room.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.600]   Prominent people follow you.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.080]   Okay, but they weren't coming to follow me. They were coming to listen to this. My point is still
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   the same. Michael Dell, Bill Ackman were coming. So
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.400]   but that's why you saw them because they're your followers.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.800]   I we all understand that. They still showed up for this in the middle of the day. I think that
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.200]   is really interesting. And that Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's all my point is, it's really
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.440]   interesting that powerful people showed up for it. Full stop.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.760]   Saks. I have a question for you. Sorry, Jason, whenever you're done.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.880]   Oh, yeah. And then I just had a couple of other ones. Elon was a bit underutilized in this format.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.040]   And that's, you know, a challenge when you have Elon in the room, because people want to ask
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.120]   Elon questions. So this is something I think he's gonna have to, you know, contend with.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.960]   People wanted to hear Elon ask questions, then the people who are more asking the questions
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.080]   wanted to ask you one question. So you do get like a little bit of how to utilize Elon in
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.320]   this format. I heard a lot of back channel from important people, like I wanted to Elon ask a
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.960]   question, or maybe the two of them get into it. So for a follow up one, getting some people,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.360]   you know, who maybe don't traditionally get to ask questions, because let's face it in
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.760]   traditional media, the only people get to ask questions are these anchors on news channels.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.320]   I want to hear Michael Dow or Bill Ackman ask a question. That's the opportunity in Twitter spaces,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.480]   maybe letting Elon ask a tough question, then a follow up or you know, like we did here with RFK,
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.160]   I would have been totally open to that. I just couldn't manage it. There was just so many people
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.680]   in the room. I didn't see Ackman actually. I mean, I totally believe he was there. But I didn't see
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.920]   the only criticism people had of you, Saks is you're a major donor and you stack the deck was
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:50.160]   the most cynical version of it with like, five people who were just super effusive. But this is
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   his launch party. So I think in that context, I would have called on Bill Ackman if I known he
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.840]   wanted to speak, but I can't see whether he raised his hand or not. No, I didn't see him in the room.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.760]   So what I was just do call on Bill Ackman. And he's like, guys, I don't want to talk. I don't
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.280]   want to put him in that spot. Can we get him on this pod so we can grill him about abortion and
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.560]   fiscal policy? Who Bill Ackman? I don't know. I look I don't speak for the campaign, but I can
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.840]   put in the request. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you put 150 dimes and get them on. Hold on. Can you
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.720]   can you tell us the actual tick tock of how this whole thing came to be the campaign within the
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.080]   last week or two had the idea of should we explore doing it on Twitter spaces, and I think they
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.360]   were open to doing it. And Saks didn't know about it. When I put it in our group chat,
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.160]   Saks was like he is. Yeah, you found out about it. I was being facetious. I was being joking.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.680]   I thought you didn't go. No, sometimes Elon will just tweet something without telling anybody.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   I just go to I mean, I help. Look, the distances people reached out to Elon and Twitter. They also
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.920]   reached out to me about it. And we discussed it and they were excited breaking new ground
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.840]   to something different. And I think they deserve credit for that. Can I ask a follow up question,
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:02.160]   just on the dissent is thing himself because you've seen him up close. Do you know why
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.120]   Schwarzman Griffin Peter Fry stepped in took a half step back? And do you know what it's going
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.280]   to take for them to just lean in and just make this a fat to complete so that he's really well
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.160]   financed to beat Trump? I don't know what their issues are. But I did see I don't know this was
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.920]   the name Peter Fry or whatever. Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't know him. But I did see a press
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:26.400]   article and he was referencing book bannings. So that to me just showed that he was buying into
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.440]   some, you know, crazy left wing. I think that was the best part of the discussion. I asked
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.360]   us about that. So by the way, for people, one thing that was new news for a lot of people was
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.040]   the book banning. Can you explain the issue and the spin and the clarification on book banning
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:48.400]   in Florida? It's very simple. They haven't banned any books in Florida. But the question is what
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.080]   books are taught in the curriculum, and what's in the school library. And some of these books were
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.440]   positively pornographic. I mean, they had someone to Santa's had an event where somebody was actually
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:05.360]   reading what was in these books. And the mere reading of what was in the books actually got
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:11.200]   labeled on social media by the algorithms. So there was a lot of stuff that's just not appropriate
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.920]   for kids. No one is restricting your ability to buy or read whatever books you want in the state
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.040]   of Florida is ridiculous. There's a legitimate question about what's in the curriculum. By the
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:27.520]   way, I remember when we had debates on campus about this is back a long time ago, like late 80s,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.280]   early 90s, when they were throwing dead white males out of the curriculum, you know, Plato,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:37.040]   Aristotle, Shakespeare, people like that. The people on the right who were opposing that never
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.120]   made the argument that this was censorship. Everybody understands that when you're dealing
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.240]   with a curriculum, you have to make choices, you can't teach everything. So the question is,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.880]   what are you going to limit it to? And I think that when people actually dug into some of these
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.400]   books, they realize that they're not appropriate. So in any event, his answer was along those lines
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.120]   that, you know, you should go listen to it for yourself. But I think that he did address
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:07.440]   that issue. I think he's kind of exposed it as a, you know, left wing media narrative.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.040]   And I think he deconstructed it. And I think that was helpful, because I think there are a lot of
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.360]   centrists who all they've heard about DeSantis is that he's banning books or, you know, or the
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:23.520]   Disney issue, which we also asked him about. And we covered that, I think. So yeah, the Yeah,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.080]   we talked about some of these controversies. The issue here, just to summarize, it is,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:36.160]   the left is framing the banning, quote, unquote, but just the not inclusion of certain books,
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.760]   which are graphic that have sex in them, from certain age groups, in schools as part of a
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.240]   curriculum. So they're saying these books are banned in Florida, the more accurate way to say
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.000]   it is, these books are not being used in curriculum. You know, for these age groups,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.560]   parents, if they want to buy them, can buy them, and then can read them. So this is where this
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.360]   conversation is kind of breaking down. And I think is a complete waste of time. All parents want
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   control over at what age or what stuff their kids are exposed to. And so there is a thoughtful
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.960]   discussion to be had there. And maybe the discussion is, this is something parents should
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.280]   decide, right? Yeah, of course, but it's not a conversation. It's a hoax. It's a it's a fake
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.560]   media narrative. They're trying to pin on him. And DeSantis has been the subject and victim
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.160]   of these types of fake media narratives, which are deliberate, the media is not trying to have
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.640]   a conversation. They're trying to disqualify the guy. And they did this, this goes all the way back
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   to COVID when he opposed lockdowns and kept schools open, and they called him DeSantis.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.920]   So the media has had an in for this guy since the beginning, because he refuses to go along
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.120]   with their narratives on things. This is the same reason they hate Elon is Elon is defying their
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.000]   narrative control. So you put these guys together, okay, hold on, even before the technical
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.600]   difficulties, let's be clear, the media's heads were exploding, that DeSantis and Elon were gonna
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.720]   be in the room together. Look at the Vanity Fair article, the headline was DeSantis announcing with
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.000]   Elon because David Duke wasn't available. Okay, the Atlantic was saying that this whole Twitter
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.040]   space was a hate group. I mean, literally, so these people were losing their minds before
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.320]   we even got into the technical difficulties. And then they pounced on that that there was a
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.160]   20 minute delay, they pounce on that as some sort of fiasco, which it wasn't
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:26.480]   will DeSantis cut spending and cut our taxes. We cut spending,
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.800]   we didn't get into that. So have you ever had a conversation with him about balancing the budget
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.600]   and federal debt? Do you know his position on cutting like long term capital gains and taxes?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.920]   I don't know his position on that. I can't let me give you the elevator pitch. I mean,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.680]   the nutshell for DeSantis is he calls it the Florida blueprint. He's saying,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.040]   look at what we've done in Florida, look at what we've achieved at Florida. Let's take
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:54.080]   Florida nationwide. Florida has had a great economy for zero budget. Zero because I don't
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.600]   that's a state that's you if you have zero tax, you have my book.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:05.280]   Dictator has spoken if people want to look up this issue. There's a book called gender queer.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.160]   And there's a story about in the New York Times. And it's, you know, it's a graphic novel about
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.240]   coming of age for a non binary person, which is fine. Great, but it's it's very graphic. It's a
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:21.600]   graphic graphic novel. It has explicit scenes. And these kind of books, most parents would say
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.880]   I would like to wait on cutting my taxes to zero. Okay, there you go. It's called the DeSantis to
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   write it. Come on, guys. Overall, great job. And yeah, get him on the pod here. And we'll have a
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:42.000]   great discussion with him. Yes. Great job. Please invite him to our pod. I think, you know, we each
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   have our own issues. We'd love or else we're just gonna go with the other Republican candidates,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.480]   Nikki, I'm proud of you. Or else I'm voting for Yes, I don't know. I mean,
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.640]   I will. Thanks, guys. Yeah. I think it'd be great to get Nikki Haley. That's a no,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.920]   that's a no. Just say no. No, no. I'm gonna put in the ass to DeSantis for sure. All right. Well,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.120]   that's great. Yeah, it would be great. People want to hear from more folks.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:10.400]   So a lot of other news going on. I think a good place for us to go to next. Maybe do we want to
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.080]   do the debt ceiling, defense spending or Nvidia? Let's go together. In my opinion. Okay, great.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.840]   We'll go with the Sultan of Science. US debt ceiling is at 31.4 trillion. Currently, Treasury
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.640]   Department recently warned the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as June
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:35.120]   1. Fitch put the US credit rating, which is the highest rank of triple A on negative watch. So
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:41.600]   negative watch means it's trending towards bad and that it's imminent that they might lower it due
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.520]   to this debt limit deadline. It seems like we're not making much progress every couple of days,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.920]   we seem to swing one way or the other, the stock market has kind of shrugged it off. And the last
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.840]   time the US credit was downgraded was in 2011. But we avoided that. Chamath what's going on here?
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.560]   What do you think the eventual outcome and is there a chance that these knuckleheads who represent
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:12.240]   us are going to default and cause chaos? Or do you think this is all kabuki theater and we're
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   going to wind up in the same place which is they raise it and make some modest concessions
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:24.800]   August 5 2011. The SMP downgraded the United States from triple A to double A plus,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:32.880]   you know what happened? Absolutely fucking nothing. Okay. So I do think that this is
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.000]   another opportunity for the little red riding hoods to get their panties in a bunch.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.120]   But these downgrades don't mean much of it to their
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:55.840]   freedom. I think that these third party credit rating agencies are not particularly that
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.480]   accurate and sophisticated. They don't know anything that you don't know.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.320]   They're not getting access to Moody's gave SVB and a rating the week before it went into
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.080]   receivership. This is my exact point. None of these companies know what they're doing. These
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.000]   companies are in the business of putting a letter on a document and then selling access to that
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.800]   document. So if you're going to trust these guys to know what they're saying, either right or wrong,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.480]   independent of what side you are outsourcing your decision making to the wrong body. So whether it's
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.960]   SMP, Fitch or Moody's, I would tell you to ignore it and come to your own conclusion. I think that
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   this budget ceiling thing is happening now every couple of years. And it seems like the real thing
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.480]   we should be talking about is whether Biden's going to use the 14th amendment and just ran a
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.320]   budget through. And I think that's, so under under the 14th amendment, the President of the United
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   States has in their discretion, the ability to make sure that the United States can pay their
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.120]   debts. And that wasn't necessarily thought of as a way to work around the debt ceiling impasse.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.360]   But because Congress refuses to pass any structural laws that allow
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:16.400]   the budget to ebb and flow with tax receipts, we get caught in this situation, again,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.520]   roughly every handful of years. So what Biden could do is he could say the 14th amendment
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.680]   gives me the right, I'm going to pass a budget via executive order.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.280]   From a game theory perspective, what that does is it forces Republicans to sue Biden,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.120]   take him to the Supreme Court and say this is unconstitutional.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.440]   The problem with that is that that probably really does tank the economy in the way that
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.560]   it creates enough uncertainty where capital markets freeze up and liquidity just absolutely
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.400]   goes away. And again, liquidity has been shrinking for the last 18 months anyways,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:56.160]   so it gets even worse. So I think the brinksmanship right now between McCarthy and Biden is basically
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.960]   that veiled threat. If Biden effectively isn't going to get something done, I think he's going
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.000]   to test the 14th amendment. Now, if the 14th amendment turns out to be a reasonable way
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.520]   in order to pass a budget, the good news is not just for Biden, but for any future president,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.600]   including Republican presidents will not have to be held hostage by Congress. They will in the 11th
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.920]   hour be able to pass a budget that works. The implications of that though, is that now you will
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   not get consensus. And whatever's happening in that moment, you'll see more of so if you have
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.040]   a spending president, they'll just continue to spend and if you have an austerity president,
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.160]   they'll continue to cut. And that'll have implications on either side.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:42.640]   Sachs, you think this is over issue as a 14th amendment? Or do you think it's a valid use of it?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   No, it's not going to fly. I mean, it's true that the 14th amendment has some language about the
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.200]   full faith and credit of the US shall not be compromised. However, it's never been tested
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.800]   or tried. So no one exactly knows what it means. Progressives are now saying that the language
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.240]   means that Biden could just keep spending without the debt limit being raised, but
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.160]   find himself through cold water on this. He said that he didn't think he had that authority. And
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.720]   even Lawrence O'Donnell, the other night, who's a big progressive on the media, he was saying that
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.440]   the Dems were going to take this tack. They needed to do it months ago before they started negotiating
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.680]   on a debt limit increase. So it's too late now. In other words, if you're going to take that
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.560]   position, why would you have negotiated that you're you the president are effectively conceding,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.320]   you don't have that authority when you start negotiating. So I think it's too late to invoke
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.560]   the 14th amendment. They're going to have to raise the debt ceiling. That being said, I think they're
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.240]   going to be able to. Reuters had a report this morning that they're only 70 72 billion apart now
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.040]   in their positions, which is a relatively small amount. So my guess is they're gonna they're gonna
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.960]   work this out. Now, what should the fate of the debt limit be moving forward? I mean, the thing
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.200]   that's so stupid about our budget process is we spend the money and then argue about whether we're
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.640]   going to pay the credit card bill. The way that the debt limit should work is you raise the debt
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.880]   before you spend it. Congress should have to vote first on whether they want a deficit or debt spend,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.600]   then you decide how much you're going to spend. So this thing, this vote needs to be moved up
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.160]   before they spend it. And I think if you did that, it'd be a lot harder for the politicians to spend
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:22.000]   money. Because, you know, if you had an up or down vote very early on saying, should we even be in
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.560]   deficit? I think a lot of people would say, No, we're not. And we're not in a war. So why? Why
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.840]   would you deficit spend? If we bring any thoughts in the debt ceiling, if not, we'll go on to
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.240]   the government accountability vis a vis the defense spending.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:40.480]   I mean, look, we're running a $2 trillion a year deficit. And it's forecast to continue
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.720]   to be at that level for several years. And it's going to take pretty
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:55.360]   radical changes in how we tax and spend to make up that gap. So you know, this is a problem that
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.840]   is going to continue and repeat. And it does beg the question, you know, would you want to
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.480]   buy bonds from an entity that's generating 4 trillion in revenue and spending 6 trillion and
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.840]   has a plan to do that for the foreseeable future? And it's only, you know, seeing its economy or
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:20.160]   its underlying revenue base grow by 2% a year. It seems like, you know, that would be a very
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.600]   hard startup to fund. And it would be a very difficult growth investment to make, particularly
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:31.360]   in an environment like this. So I'm just pointing out that this is a becoming a more kind of
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:38.880]   systemically risky situation for the US, that, you know, we spend the way we do. And we have
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.720]   to keep coming back to having these debates about it's appropriate or not. And now they've narrowed
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.200]   down the way that the Republicans seem to be kind of going about getting this done.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.360]   This deal done is they're only focusing on the, you know, roughly 15% of the overall
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.920]   federal budget. And they're saying, we'll kind of make some tweaks in that in that little range
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:01.280]   there and save some save some pennies, save some nickels. But we've got a much more fundamental
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.440]   problem to deal with, which is, how do we stop running these deficits and running the debt up?
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.880]   But I mean, I'm gonna sound like I'm gonna sound like a friggin.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.800]   No, I think you're right. At some point. Yeah,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.640]   the inflation is here. And the crowding out of private investment and private borrowing is now
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.120]   occurring because the government borrowing is so big. I mean, our Treasury, our government debt
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   of what, three, 2 trillion, that has to be financed somehow. And all that money is going
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.240]   to finance government instead of being put to other uses. So I think that the downsides already
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.200]   here, you can't run $2 trillion deficits every year, that's unsustainable. Now, I think that
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.360]   you guys reference what happened in 2011. That's worth discussing for a second, because I actually
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.880]   think that what was agreed to in 2011 was excellent. Obama and the Republicans in Congress
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.280]   agreed to a thing called the sequester, where they agreed that they would freeze both defense and
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   non defense discretionary spending until they could get their act together and agree on what
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.520]   the budget should look like. And so the theory was, the Republicans agreed to the pain of freezing
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.320]   defense, Democrats agreed to the pain of freezing non entitlement social spending. And that's how
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.760]   the deal was cut. I actually think that made a lot of sense. And I think we should have kept
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:21.040]   operating under the sequester until we got to a balanced budget. But the reason that broke,
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:26.640]   quite frankly, is because the lobbying power of the military industrial complex is so great in both
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.480]   the Republican and Democratic parties, that they basically wanted the sequester over the defense
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.800]   budget. I think it's just that there's never been a degree of accountability for the spending that's
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   being done because of this assumption that we'll always be able to pay our debt, and we'll always
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:46.800]   be able to take on more debt. And I think that you see the other conversation, the other topic
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:53.040]   that we were going to talk about was this lack of accountability and defense spending that,
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.320]   you know, we should play the Jon Stewart clip. You know, where I think it who is he interviewed
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.040]   the Under Secretary of Defense or something? What is her title?
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.280]   Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was discussing a defense budget.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:11.840]   When I see a State Department get a certain amount of money and a military budget be 10 times that,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.720]   and I see a struggle within government to get people like more basic services. I mean,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:22.400]   we got out of 20 years of war and the Pentagon got a $50 billion raise. Like, that's shocking
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.600]   to me. Now, I may not understand exactly the ins and outs and the incredible magic of an audit,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:37.760]   but I'm a human being who lives on the earth and can't figure out how $850 billion to a department
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:44.160]   means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. Like, to me, that's fucking corruption.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.680]   And then there was a story that came out this week, according to Bloomberg,
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   the government accountability office disclosed that the Pentagon is currently unable to account
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.040]   for hundreds of 1000s of spare parts for the F 35 jets, the Pentagon's never passed, never passed
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:05.520]   an audit, and it's accepted. And it's acceptable in the same way that it's acceptable to never
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:12.960]   balance the budget, to always spend and give everyone what they want. And to find ourselves
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.760]   in, you know, this kind of late stage problem where we've gotten away with it for so long that
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:24.560]   both of those factors, whether it's the downgrade on the rating, whether it's the fact that we end
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.840]   up in these battles over whether to raise the debt ceiling every couple of years, or whether
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.560]   we can't pass an audit, all of these factors are symptoms of the same underlying problem,
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.480]   which is that there is no accountability for you know, how we operate the, you know,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.880]   the kind of fiscal condition of the federal government,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.680]   you know, the other thing it leads to is all these optional wars. So let me give you an example. So
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.400]   all of these wars are always they're all free. Yeah, they're all off book. So take Ukraine,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.880]   we've appropriated what 130 billion, that's not part of the defense budget, we have eight or a
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.960]   billion in the defense budget, but then we just stacked 100 billion or so for Ukraine on top of
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.480]   that, and it's off book. Now, if we said the reason we're funding Ukraine is because it improves
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.560]   the national defense of the United States, why wouldn't that just come out of the defense budget,
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.440]   if you force people to make actual choices, actual decisions, and they could say, okay,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:21.680]   we could spend 100 billion on Ukraine, or we could spend 100 billion on stockpiling tanks or
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.880]   f 35s, or whatever for the United States. Now you actually force some prioritization decisions.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.920]   But because the wars are always off book, they're just additive, you just tack them on. And we did
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.800]   that with in Afghanistan, we did that in Iraq, we spent something like $8 trillion. And that was
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.600]   just added to the national debt. Yeah, we can't afford these anymore. It's becoming clear to
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.040]   everybody that there has to be some accountability. And Chamath, I guess, is, seems like there's a
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.400]   couple of unpopular stances to take when you're running for office. One of them is social security,
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.040]   retirement age, as we saw in other countries like France, where people are arguing over 62,
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:03.280]   64 years old, whatever it is. Yeah. And so these entitlements, job requirements, if you want to get
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.200]   unemployment, and then of course, defense spending, you seem un-American, if you don't want to take
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:13.840]   care of old people, you seem un-American. And, you know, weak, if you don't want to support
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.840]   the government, is there a path towards celebrating an administrator as CEO,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.560]   an executive who tells honest truth to the American people, which is, hey, we've been on a
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.360]   binge, we've been going on vacation, nobody's looking at the bills. And we need to have a
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.960]   staycation. We need to cut costs, we need some austerity here. Is there a path for somebody,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, RFK, whoever it is, to win over the American public to win over
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.800]   moderates with an austerity and a balance the budget message? Or is it just too unpopular to
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:55.280]   even bring that up? I just think that you guys don't psychologically understand how to get what
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:02.000]   you want. I think the best way to get what you want, which I would want to, which is a healthy
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.400]   economy where there's accountability for spending, is to not look at expenses. And all of this talk
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:17.440]   is always about expenses, but to look at revenue, and limit revenue more drastically. And I think
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:23.040]   the best way to limit revenue dramatically at the federal and state level is to just minimize
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.880]   taxation as much as possible. And I think that is something that Democrats and Republicans have a
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:34.240]   hard time fighting. Nobody wants to raise their hand and say, I want new taxes. Nobody says that.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.920]   Right. And I think that if you attach that to some sort of spending guidelines,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:45.200]   like what David says with a sensible foreign policy, you just end up spending a lot less you
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.280]   want to fight a foreign war. Okay, great. Well, you know what, it's part of the existing budget,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.680]   let's go figure out why we want to do it. We want to have more accountability and defense spending.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.400]   Okay, well, look, the defense budget is a half of what it used to be, because we just have half the
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.200]   revenue. I think that if you start to go and talk about austerity and cutting Social Security and
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.640]   healthcare benefits, it's literally a non starter. People close their eyes, they plug their ears,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:14.880]   and you get nowhere. Now, separately, I think the step even before you look at taxation,
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.960]   so minimizing government revenue is to figure out how to refinance. So if you're a homeowner,
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:28.640]   and you got a mortgage in the 80s, you were paying 12 1415 16%. If when rates kept going down,
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:35.760]   you were the people around you didn't have the common sense to refinance that that was negligence.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:43.280]   Similarly, we're in a position today to refinance our debt wall and push out these maturities past
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:49.760]   100 plus years, we are the only country that has a viable, stable economy that looks like it can
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:55.200]   still continue to thrive at scale. Take advantage of that, you lose nothing by giving us the
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.240]   optionality, generating some 100 year debt refinancing a bunch of this short term stuff.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:07.440]   And then second, inflation helps us. And it helps us because it allows us to inflate the value of
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:13.680]   these dollars that allows us to pay off our short term maturity. So these are two practical, simple
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.440]   things that are uncontroversial, that should happen today. And then separately, I think you need to
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:25.680]   look at minimizing revenue. And then you can cut expenses. But if you flip them around, I'm just
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.240]   telling you, I stopped like I want any of this to happen. But I'm telling you nothing will change.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.040]   And you guys will still be crying wolf in five years, it'll still be the same, it'll just be a
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.480]   different debt to GDP number that gives you anxiety. Speaking of anxiety, freeberg your
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.760]   response. I don't agree. I think we need to balance the budget. And I think that if we don't,
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.440]   we agree with financing, pushing out 100 year no, no, I don't agree. Reducing revenue solves
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.960]   the problem. I think that and by the way, one of the problems with a democracy to mop is that
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:03.440]   you speak about it as if everyone benefits from a tax cut. Generally, there's some disproportionate
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:09.040]   benefit to a tax cut. And that's why it's less likely to happen because the majority will benefit
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.680]   by keeping taxes high for a minority, whether that's some corporate minority, or whether it's
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:21.600]   some wealthy individual minority. And that's why I think the opposite is more likely to happen,
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.000]   which is we're more likely to see taxes go up in order to bridge the gap to continue to fund
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.320]   programs that everyone wants to everyone wants an and they don't want an or. And as a result,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.160]   they'll kind of continue to seek revenue because there are other places to get revenue that don't
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.240]   affect me, meaning it doesn't affect the majority. And I don't mean me personally,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.800]   I'm just speaking about a voter and a voter would say if there's a way to tax other people
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.040]   for me to get the things I want, they will vote yes for that. And that's ultimately what the
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.280]   system ends up finding. And I think that's what's more likely to end up happening. That's all.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.200]   Sacks. Yeah, look, I mean, I agree with part of both of what you're saying, which is,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.360]   I agree with free bird that we need to balance the budget. There's no excuse for running peacetime
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.680]   deficits this large, we're really going to regret this one day. On the other hand, I agree with
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.800]   tomorrow that if you just try to solve the problem by raising taxes, the politicians will just keep
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.080]   spending. I mean, you have to starve the beast, I think, in order to control it. At least that's
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.520]   been a view, I think, for a long time. Do you agree with tomorrow on that point?
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.920]   Here's the thing, you cannot solve this problem by raising up to 70% tax rates like we had in
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.240]   the 1970s. And I can prove it, pull up this chart. France is a good example of this, too.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.000]   So what you see in this chart here is this is federal receipts, a percentage of GDP. What I
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.920]   see when I eyeball this is if you were to put a regression line on that, it'd be at around 17%,
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:47.360]   with a plus or minus of 2%. And the times when you get up to 19%, or a little bit close to 20%
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.960]   are when we have great economic conditions, or money printing. So the Clinton era from
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.040]   was a 92 to 2000 was an economic boom. And we got up to almost 20%. But we've never ever been
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:06.160]   able to get more than 20% of GDP and federal tax receipts, even during the 1970s, when the top
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:14.000]   marginal rate was 70%. What happens? Why is that the people guys are doing economic activity,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.360]   it curtails investment and economic activity. This is documented for hundreds of years,
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.960]   taxation doesn't solve this problem. I don't disagree. I just can only get so much blood from
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.320]   a stone. And the reality is, is that when you try to tax rich people in a confiscatory way,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:34.960]   they spend a lot more on lawyers and accountants to figure out how to structure their income in a
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.040]   way that they leave, or they tap out, you know, like, if you're paying 50 60% taxes, like,
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.440]   what's the incentive to go to work? And if you're sitting on a big nut, you can just be like,
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.800]   No, you know, and I'll just I'll just enjoy my life a little bit more, because each incremental
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:55.600]   dollar 50 60% going to taxes, and then I have to pay my team and you just sort of I asked a
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:00.000]   question on Twitter, you know, because we all talked in our group chat about the concept of
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.080]   passing a balanced budget amendment, which would be an amendment to the US Constitution that says,
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.160]   you know, Congress has an obligation and the executive branch has an obligation
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:16.000]   to generate a budget surplus, you know, every, every year. And you could have a
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.600]   balanced budget amendment that provides certain exemptions to this, like in a year of war,
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:28.000]   for example, where Congress declares an emergency or declares a war. And in those cases,
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.400]   theoretically, like if there's some sort of emergency that we have to address and overfund,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.600]   you can kind of resolve to this. But man, I so might.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.440]   But you know, we've been we've been at war for something like two out of every three years since
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.240]   the Cold War ended. How many of those war sacks were voted on by Congress is the other issue?
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.680]   You know, what happened is we did the authorization for the use of force, I think goes all the way
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:58.480]   back to was it like 2001? Whereas basically, we declare a war on terrorism in response to 911.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:03.120]   And they use that authorization to go into Afghanistan, which I think was understandable,
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.960]   then they use that same one to go into Iraq, then they use it to go into Syria.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:13.520]   And only recently, only a few months ago, do they actually repeal that use of force as a way to keep
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:19.280]   authorizing new wars. So they really should go back to Congress for every new war. But the problem is,
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.720]   you know, Freeberg, I agree with you that we need to have a balanced budget amendment, but
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.320]   it's going to contain a caveat or exception for war. And we're just at war all the time now.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.920]   Sure. But I think that there's ways to create some mechanism that forces
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.360]   that issue to actually come front and center as opposed to being what you're arguing, which is,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.360]   hey, it's always on the back burner, therefore, it's always bubbling over. And maybe you draft
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   it that way. But what was surprising to me was just the incredible negative sentiment I got from
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:48.800]   so many people who are so deeply have this deeply held belief that the only way to support growth
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.520]   in our economy is through federal spending. And that that has become the driver that has become
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.400]   the handicap of our country. It has become the handicap of our economy. It has become the
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.720]   handicap of our people. And as a result, a handicap, because it means that we now have this,
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.760]   instead of having an incentive to drive productivity through private commercial
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.000]   and economic activity through innovation, through productivity gains through business building,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.760]   it's now dependent on what we have now identified as a highly unaccountable system of spending.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.600]   And that unaccountable system of spending ends up putting a lot of dollars into the pockets of
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.400]   cronies and the pockets of folks that aren't actually driving job growth or aren't driving
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.960]   productivity. There are certainly programs that work. But overall, there's no level or degree
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.040]   of accountability that asks the question, did that program work? Did we spend $1 and get more than $1
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.360]   back for what we spent? There's no assessment of that, whether it's a war, or whether it's
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.440]   defense spending. There's always some kind of intellectual argument that says true.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.120]   I don't think that's true. I think the OMB releases report after report saying that all
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.200]   of this stuff sucks and doesn't do anything. Just nobody actually cares.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.360]   You're right. I don't care. I think what you're saying is inaccurate. This is my point. I think
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:01.440]   it's important to get the facts right. What you are saying is not true. They do do an accounting
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.920]   that accounting sucks. It shows that there's tons of waste. Nothing changes. So now what do you want
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.640]   to do, David? Is the real question. What do you want to do knowing that we shouldn't spend on
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.240]   things that don't have a positive return? This is my point. That's why we're now in this very
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:18.640]   difficult situation. That's not happening. Now, what would you like to do? Well, the reason it
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.680]   doesn't happen is because the way that politics decides things has nothing to do with the merits
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.040]   of it. It has to do with special interest. I'm not debating that. I agree. I'm just saying,
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.080]   I got it. But this is what I do now. Just reality for a second. This is why I think our education
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.600]   system is like fundamentally betrayed the country because we just keep teaching people that somehow
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.280]   the government's going to solve all these problems, when really, it's just a product of special
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   interest lobbying for things. And that's why we perpetuate these programs that don't work.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   I think the best way to think about government spending is that in every dollar, there's
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:53.440]   probably 15 or 20 cents that actually does some good. There's probably 15 to 20 cents that's like
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:59.520]   on the margins break even. And then the rest of it, which is half of it is wasted. That's probably
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.880]   roughly accurate, right? You get things like TARP, which turned out to be pretty decent program.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.680]   There were things like the DOE loans that you know, got things like Tesla into the marketplace,
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.760]   right? There's things like the IRA today that'll de-lever ourselves and create a peace dividend
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.720]   because we won't need to fight over resources and oil from other countries. But the problem is that
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.840]   that represents a minority of the dollars. Okay, now that we know that that's true, and we've known
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.920]   that that's true for decades, I guess again, I'm just asking a practical question. What do you guys
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.240]   want to do now play the ball where it lies? What do we do today? There's a couple things you could
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.560]   do. First of all, one of the points I'd make is, I think you're probably right in your assessment
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.280]   that 50 cents, that's what you're calling wasted that money does end up somewhere, it ends up in
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.640]   someone's pockets, probably the pockets of the shareholders of some contractor, or the donors
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.760]   of individuals or employees. Well, there's also there's also individuals that benefit,
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.880]   but functionally, what's going on is it's a system of wealth transfer. And that's not necessarily bad.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.920]   The question is, is the transfer of wealth happening to the right groups that we intend
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:09.040]   to support with these social programs? Or is it not? And I think Saksa's point, which I think we
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   could all probably align on is it's not. And I think that's probably a set of standards for
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.000]   accountability that we should probably try and create. But where does that where does that money
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.400]   end up? It ends up buying homes, feeding people, they're going to restaurants, you're buying cars,
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   not like there's like, a fleet of mega yachts in America. Well, I guess what I'm asking is where
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.720]   even that leakage of 50% doesn't that just end up in the normal economy? Yeah, it ends up supporting
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:37.600]   individuals and they buy a trickle down. Why is that so bad? Here's what I'll say. But that's
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.800]   what I'm saying. It is a wealth transfer. It is a system of wealth where it ends up in people's
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.600]   pockets. And that that system ultimately benefits a lot of people in need and a lot of people that
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.480]   we as a society intend to support here in the US. I don't think it just goes to poor people.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:59.440]   Yes. There's so much corporate welfare. I mean, come on. It's not all just going to needy people.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:07.520]   On some level, we can accept the inefficiency of government. I like your idea of constraining
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:14.320]   how much of a canvas they have to paint with and how much revenue they bring in. And I think what
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.440]   we have to accept is that the reason this country gets bailed out is because we have tremendous
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:26.320]   entrepreneurs, an amazing capital allocation system, a very fluid market for building corporate
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.240]   corporations and capitalism is so vibrant here, that no matter what happens, we always seem to
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:38.320]   make the next Google, Uber, Nvidia, whatever it is, Airbnb. And I can tell you, you know,
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.640]   spending a lot of time traveling, meeting with people in Japan, in UAE, etc. They're all looking
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.760]   at the massive entrepreneurial drive that we have in the United States to build global companies
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:55.040]   and how we do it over and over and over again. And the only countries that seem to be able to do this
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:01.760]   at scale, you know, maybe Sweden and some of the Nordics, obviously China, but other countries have
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:06.560]   not figured out how to build global corporations. And that is what bails us out every time is
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.160]   entrepreneur allocators,
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:12.400]   take out the deficits getting so big that we can't bail out that way. Think about it. We have 2
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:18.800]   trillion in deficit every year. That is two Googles. Yeah, it's an apple. We're spending an
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.520]   apple every year.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.720]   We have to we have to address it. But the point is, that's how we have bailed ourselves out.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.920]   Historically is massive capital allocation and entrepreneurship.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.320]   I want to remind you guys what happened at the end of the 70s.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.000]   We had all these inflationary problems. We had all of these taxation problems where people thought
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.240]   all of a sudden 70% tax rates, we're going to solve the problem, what you guys talked about.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.920]   And instead, the exact opposite thing happened, which was the guy that got elected.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.320]   Ronald Reagan, I just want to remind you what the electoral college was between him and Jimmy
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   Carter, for 89 to 49, like a bigger, just shellacking, I don't think we've seen in modern
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:02.160]   US politics to the guy that basically said enough with this, we're going to tone it all down. And
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.960]   we're going to cut revenues. So I do think that people have an appetite for them. And I think
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:13.280]   the debt to GDP in 1980 was only 30%. So we just have a lot less dry powder work to do. We got a
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.600]   lot of work to do. But let me say this. Look, Chamath, I actually agree with what you're saying
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:22.960]   in this sense. Okay, if you look at my simple chart of federal tax receipts as percent of GDP,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:30.160]   okay, the highest it's ever been in the history of the United States is 19.75%. In 2000, we had
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.960]   the dot com bubble. Okay, that's the highest ever been. And we had periods of high tax rates and low
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:41.920]   tax rates, it never went above 20%. So the simple math here is, you do a forecast of what do you
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.440]   think GDP is gonna be over the next year, you get independent economists to do it. And you say,
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.880]   the federal government can't spend more than 20% of GDP, because we've never extracted that we've
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.080]   never figured out a way to extract it's perfect. Your logic is perfect out of the economy. The
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.240]   logic is perfect there. Your aggression is so it's very important, because what your aggression says
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:04.480]   is, we're actually spending a lot of energy fighting over two to 300 basis points at any
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:09.520]   given time. Right? Yeah. And what we should be focusing on is more important. Why are we doing
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.680]   that? Why are we spending so much time getting our panties in a bunch over two to 300 basis points,
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:19.440]   and we need to stop wars, increase our education system, stop the wars, by the way, and inspire
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:24.160]   people to start companies and make it easy to start companies, the BL, the IRA, and the chips
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.800]   act, all three, the biggest components in all three bills, this is Biden's signature legislation,
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:34.480]   is creating energy independence for America, which will have an enormous peace dividend,
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:40.080]   you will not fight these stupid, endless wars. Every single one of them goes back to oil,
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.200]   right? Like, with the exception of it's always about resources. Yeah, what has never been about
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.800]   resources in modern history? Well, and now it's going to be chips is the modern resource
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.840]   Nvidia shares jumped as much as 30% after reporting huge revenue guidance due to AI demand
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:58:02.160]   q1 revenue 7.2 bill up 19% quarter over quarter, not year over year quarter over quarter
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:08.320]   revenue beat animal assessments by more than 600 million for people don't know Nvidia is
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:16.640]   working on GPUs as opposed to CPUs, the graphic processing units that are being leveraged in AI.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.920]   And there is a massive cycle going on. There's a line out the door to buy these when you see
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.480]   Twitter going into AI, Facebook, Google, and obviously, Microsoft,
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.200]   all the cloud infrastructure is moving from CPU to GPU. Yes, freeberg.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:38.560]   Well, I mean, I was talking with the CEO and CFO of a major data center, reach, and they
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:45.280]   shared with me that they're seeing more demand in the last couple of months than they've seen in
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.760]   the prior 10 years, almost all of that data center build out demand. So they'll build data centers for
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:58.240]   software companies for internet companies is coming from, you know, GPU racks, and these
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:03.360]   GPU racks are much more energy intensive, much more costly, but it's a pretty kind of
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:07.200]   significant shift underway that businesses that historically didn't even operate their own
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:12.080]   data centers are now building out their own data centers have their own training systems to have
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:20.320]   their own infrastructure to be able to run AI applications and tools. So it's a pretty
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.400]   significant shift underway. All of the growth that Nvidia is projecting and
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:30.560]   highlighted in this earnings report yesterday, is coming from their their data center line of
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.640]   products. And it's a pretty significant I mean, I don't know, people have said they've never seen
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:40.480]   a beat like this or never seen an up a guidance update like this of the scale, where I think the
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:45.680]   street was looking for maybe a $7 billion guide and on revenue for this. And they basically came
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.560]   out and said they're going to guide to 11 billion next quarter, which is just an insane bump for a
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:55.520]   90 day outlook. I was told from one of their major customers that they had to beg, like,
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:02.400]   he's in bag for 1000s of GPUs. And like the lobbying effort, he said, there's a line around
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:08.640]   the corner to buy these and you need only use chat GPT or any stable diffusion, etc. And you
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   see how long it takes to do by generative AI to use these products. It's like we're back to dial
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:21.440]   up modem sacks. We're literally, we're waiting for a computer to give us an answer. When's the
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:26.240]   last time that happened that we had to sit there and wait for it to do its job. And I think this
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.600]   is the great renewal for America, another amazing American company. It's only three decades old,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.400]   its best years, its best decades are in front of it. Obviously, this is going to be a massive boon
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.600]   for Yeah, not only in video, but for America, or as I say, America.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   Yeah, and videos basically joined the trillion dollar club. Now, in terms of market cap companies,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.360]   it's really amazing. I mean, I'm kind of kicking myself because this was the easiest buy ever.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.880]   chat GPT launched on November 30. We all saw that that immediately ushered in a whole new era in
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:01.040]   Silicon Valley. There's a ton of VC funding that's poured into AI startups, they all need to train
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:07.920]   models. And those models need to use GPU. So we all saw this coming. And I'm kind of annoyed with
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.240]   myself. I didn't let me ask you, let me ask you a question. So you say that you kick yourself,
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.960]   obviously, the general statement that you know, AI is coming and Nvidia is going to be a beneficiary
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.360]   or Nvidia's products are going to see a boon makes sense. But when you look at the valuation of the
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:29.760]   business, they are currently trading at 70 times the next 12 months EBITDA. So how do you think
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.920]   about valuation even at a trillion dollar market cap at a trillion dollar market, they're trading
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.680]   at 70 times next 12 months EBITDA. You know, this seems like they're doubling revenue every six
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.040]   months, though, dude, they're doubling revenue. Here, how high does it go? Because at a trillion
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.360]   dollars, what's the right EBITDA level for a business to be worth a trillion dollars? Is it
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.640]   100? Is it 100? But I mean, what's the number? And then the question is, if it's 100 billion,
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.080]   how many years does it take them to grow into that? And you know, are you really paying
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.120]   the right price? Are you paying a premium to get, you know,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.200]   and will be determined if they have competition. So is there competition for this company?
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.120]   Chamath, you'd think there's a competitor that will emerge that, you know, I mean,
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.840]   it's important to understand what a GPU is, maybe so sure, Intel had the run of the place for the
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.240]   first 40 years of compute. Because it turned out that most of the things that we use it for Excel,
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:30.400]   Microsoft Word, a browser, operated well on a CPU, which essentially think about it as like a
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.640]   factory that takes in the first order and then puts it up first and first up. And the great
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.720]   thing about GPUs is that it can take multiple streams of work at the same time and work on
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.640]   them at the same time, right? So it's very parallel and has this level of parallelism
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:52.160]   that makes it very well suited for AI applications. I think the thing to keep in mind is that it is
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:59.120]   a byproduct of a GPU that tries to also do other things. And so as a result of that, you're now
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.680]   seeing a lot of companies building their own silicon. And most importantly, all the big tech
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.400]   companies now have some pretty well evolved efforts underway. So a lot of these companies
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.200]   have figured out how to do custom basics that can do this massively parallel processing. And what
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.240]   you're now seeing is chips that are designed against specific models that are optimized for
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   them. The other thing that you're also seeing is that some people are saying, well, you know what,
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.440]   for these massive models, actually, you should just run it all in memory. And so you're having
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.880]   folks that are doing it in, in massive arrays of FPGAs. That was Microsoft's first attempt at all
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.920]   of this. So what is the point of me telling you this, I think that, again, we talked about this
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:47.040]   last week, the biggest cheerleaders of this first point of value creation has really been Wall
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:53.120]   Street and family offices that wanted to front run where the value creation was going to initially go
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.200]   and they've been right, which is around chips. But there was a tweet and Nick, I posted it,
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.040]   maybe you can throw it up here that shows that if you compare this to the mobile internet,
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   there's always this phased approach in terms of value creation, where let's just say,
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.600]   initially in a new market mobile, a decade ago, and AI today, the first dollar of profits tends
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.360]   to go to the chip companies, that makes a lot of sense, right? Because they're the ones that
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:24.320]   are in the bowels of making the elemental capabilities possible. And then you transition
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.160]   that value. And what freeberg says is people realize, hey, hold on, the profit dollars are
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.840]   not going to accrue there. Because again, this beautiful principle of capitalism is that you can
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   only over earn for a certain amount of time, because then competitors emerge and say, hold on,
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:44.560]   I want to steal those profit dollars from you and take them for myself. So margins compress,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.480]   right. So in the end, and videos gains today will be then spread across Nvidia,
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.240]   Facebook will have their own chip, Amazon will have their own chip, Google already does.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.840]   Apple will have their own chip, all the memory companies will be in this space, right? So then
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.960]   the profits get smeared there, multiples compress, then where does the value grow to the device
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.400]   companies in the mobile internet? Here, I think we still have to debate what is a device company
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.840]   in the world of AI. But the most important thing I think to remember is that where the real value
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:23.280]   gets accrued is 567 years later, when the software and services companies show up and create a huge
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:28.720]   moat. And those are the Googles and the Facebook's and the apples of the world. And so it's a really
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.680]   dynamic moment. I think it's wonderful for Nvidia. It's an amazing story for Jensen, who's
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.240]   been really at this game for a very long time. By the way, there's a Jensen has a law of his own
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.960]   that is a sort of companion to Moore's law called Wang's law named after himself, which you can read
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.200]   about, which just talks about the variability of the compute capabilities of GPUs versus CPUs. So
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.440]   if you want to know that he should get some credit for that. But I think it's great. I think we're in
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.920]   the Apple is also making their own GPUs. That's what when you hear the M two that has GPUs in it.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:06.240]   So yeah, you're absolutely correct. Anyone. So we're gonna have a few years, we're gonna have a
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.760]   few quarters for sure of this hype. And then the smart money will probably figure out where the
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.480]   next the lily pad is. And then they'll go to the next beautifully said, beautifully said.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.000]   Any other thoughts, free break as we wrap up on that, I wanted to show this AI demo from
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.840]   Adobe Photoshop, you know, every week or so, we see something that's incredible. And this one was
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:33.520]   we shared in the group chat. But for those who don't keep up this out, you know, so what we see
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:40.320]   here, if you're listening, is, you know, taking a Photoshop creating an area and then instead of
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.280]   like, cutting and pastes, pasting or refining it, you're putting in a text prompt and saying, Oh,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:54.480]   put expand the and make this widescreen or let me grab this deer out of a forest and then put it on
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.320]   a wet alley at night. And then you know, let me highlight this wall over here and put a sign and
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:06.000]   put a red arrow sign and it just generates it and it's doing this, they made specific note when they
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.240]   launched this that all of this is done with stock photography, they have the complete license to
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:17.360]   so they can monetize this without getting sued. Like Microsoft is currently being sued. And
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:25.120]   Microsoft actually, in addition to the GitHub lawsuit, it's turns out Twitter sent a letter
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.440]   over to Microsoft as well. So incredible demo, the producers here at all in as our production team
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:40.160]   grows. Producer Brian made a little video here. Here's chemoth in before the Laura Piana days.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.960]   That's that's Tom Ford. Yeah, that's Tom Ford. This is when bad hair, terrible hair is terrible.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:55.680]   You look tired. The watch. No, I had a night. My god, I played poker. Literally, I walked into that
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:05.200]   to that. See, I'm straight from the poker table. Brutal to the squawk. Wait, no tie. But he's
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.440]   wearing a tie. There's a Tom Ford. Yeah, he said, Did you he said, try this without the without a
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.160]   tie. I said, Okay. Oh, you were talking to Tom Ford. Great. What a flex. You know, Tom Ford is
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.920]   probably twice in my life. I can tell you both stories. Okay, well, hold on a second. He said,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.360]   we're degenerate AI and make a yellow sweater is the prompt here. Let's see if he goes to Bert.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:30.800]   From Ernie to Bert. There is Sri Lankan Bert, as we call him in the not that doesn't quite get the
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:38.480]   borders right. It looks like a Warriors jersey. Oh, there you go. Pretty bad. Yeah. Yeah. Change
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.120]   my hair bro. Change my hair. I think the demo was bullshit. Change his hair. Can we can we have the
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:50.720]   hair be less in sync? Less Hasan Minaj and more given I understand why they call you a Z's. I'm
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.080]   sorry. I think the you had the hair going there. The hair. Yeah, it's a lot of lift. And what was
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:02.880]   that day? Buddy? What is that? Is it putty? This is like eight years ago. Is it what are you using
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.120]   clay or putty? What do you Yeah, it's like it's like a stiff. It's like a stiff hair wax. I think
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:13.440]   it's a hair wax. Got it. Yeah. I've come such a long way since now. Much more. Much more stylish.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:17.600]   I mean, look at sex is crazy hair as we as we probably did in the cold open. My thought on
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.280]   the Adobe thing for what it's worth is like, I mean, do they want a mulligan on this $20 billion
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:30.880]   Figma thing or do they get to see the ongoing revenues that Figma is generating? I don't want
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.880]   to curse you. Sure. They're looking to Lena Khan, all kinds of stuff. It's a different product,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.200]   though. I mean, the AI stuff certainly has had an impact. But I mean, so much of the benefit of
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.000]   Figma is it's web based. It's collaborative. It's like people kind of use it online to make stuff
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.840]   together. It's a little different than the other tools that they offer today. So you don't think
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:54.800]   it from September to now? Like, nothing changes, they should just close this thing at 20 billion or
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.040]   or half their half, they think that they should pay a billion, break it up and then redo the deal
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:06.240]   at 10. And then it costs nine, remember, not all breakup fees mean that you can break up for any
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.120]   reason. So there's only there's limited outs on what you can pay a breakup fee to get out of it,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:18.320]   one of which could be antitrust or regulatory. But otherwise, you may be forced to close in court if
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.520]   you don't have a valid reason for terminating the deal. Their only hope is to get Lena Khan to
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.080]   muck it up. Yeah, some leaks come off is your argument more that they bought Figma top of
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.560]   market pricing, which no longer makes sense? Or is your argument that they're innovating so well,
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:40.640]   they don't need it. I think it's a little bit of both. But it's, it's more that I think this
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.960]   generative AI stuff allows you to refresh I tweeted this out. So Nick, maybe you can put it up there.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.720]   But I think the first thing is that your feature set can catch up pretty quickly. So even if you
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:57.920]   set out a team and said just copy exactly what Figma has, with a co pilot, enabling 50 engineers,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.720]   that's like 500 engineers cranking on something, I would be surprised if they couldn't just
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.920]   replicate the product end to end. That's the first thing. Then the second thing is,
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:13.920]   I think that you've seen VC funding basically crawl to a halt. And so the question there is
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:17.600]   how many of those companies are just going to stop spending because they're just not going to exist.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:25.120]   And then the third thing is, if we're sort of hashtag austerity, people are going to look at
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.240]   everything they're spending money on and try to be really disciplined about it. If you roll all
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:34.720]   those things together, sacks, my thought is, maybe the deal still makes sense. But does it make sense
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.120]   at 20 billion? And does it then just create a whole suite of shareholder lawsuits after the
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.560]   fact that are just going to say these three things and regurgitate them ad nauseum? That's the
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.000]   curiosity I had? Well, so we're here, let's talk a little bit about the state of Silicon Valley
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.680]   sacks. We were talking offline after the show last week. You've slowed down investment at your
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.120]   firm craft, you're being thoughtful, you're working on the existing portfolios, how would
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:05.200]   you describe your activity so far in the first half of 2023 as a firm if you're so willing to
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.000]   share that my take on what's happening in Silicon Valley right now or tech more generally is it's a
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.400]   tale of two cities. It's the best of times for AI startups and the worst of times for everybody else.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   The AI startups, there's a lot of interesting things happening in there and money is being
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.640]   pushed at them by VCs. It's very frothy, arguably bubbly. But then at the same time, if you're a
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:32.160]   pre AI company, maybe the one that raised a lot of money at a big valuation in 2020 or 2021,
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   it's a pretty tough time. I don't know of any startup, especially like later stage startups
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:43.200]   who are hitting their numbers. Everyone is reforecasting down, everyone's missing. I think
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:48.960]   that speaks to the larger economy is not doing that well. I think the economists a year from now
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.480]   may say that the recession had already begun. It certainly feels like that.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.880]   That's what Druk said at the Sohn conference. I think that startups are absolutely seeing that
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.720]   in their sales right now. Sales are slipping, it's taking longer, buyers are sharpening their
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.600]   pencils. It's a really tough environment, I think, for software startups that are actually trying to
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.520]   make sales. AI startups are a little bit exempt for that because people are still investing based
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:18.320]   on the dream, not based on the metrics. I would say that we're very interested in AI and we're
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.920]   starting to make some investments, but we also like to invest based on metrics, not just on a
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.360]   dream. We're being somewhat cautious about how we approach it. You make a small seed bet in somebody
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.800]   who has a dream, if I can translate here, but if you're going to make a bigger bet, a series A,
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.600]   series B, you're going to want to see some numbers on the board. You're going to want to see some
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.880]   product and market. I think that's a really good way of putting it because I think the standards
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:44.800]   change at each round. At the seed stage, you can absolutely just make a bet based on the dream or
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:51.920]   just based on a founder. Great founder going after the AI space idea, still a little bit to be fleshed
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.440]   out, you can make that bet. 500k, 750k. Even 3 million will do as a big seed round. Then when
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.600]   you get to series A and you want us to write a 10, 12, 15 million dollar check, we kind of want to
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.920]   see some revenue. Certainly by the time you get to series B or series C, we want to see all the
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.440]   standard metrics. We want to see net dollar retention, expansion, all that kind of stuff.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.160]   Yeah, it's really hard for the later stage startups because they raised, and this is the
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.760]   lesson, if you're raising at three, four, 500 million sacks, correct me if I'm wrong here,
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:29.680]   you have to build into that valuation. Let's face it, that valuation A was never realistic,
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:34.240]   it was overpriced. Then B, you got the headwinds and your customers are saying, "Oh, you want 40,000
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.240]   a year for this last product? We'll give you 12." What position are you in to turn down the 12? You
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.080]   got to take the 12 because you got three competitors who are going to roll up and take the 12.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.600]   It's hard.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.920]   Actually, can I give you an update? Remember I mentioned there was a startup in my portfolio,
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:56.000]   actually my angel portfolio that was doing a beta play around, the cram down. I think it's
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.240]   absolutely tragic because of what I learned, which is the founders got crammed down too,
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.080]   because a year ago they brought in a professional CEO. I think as a result of this, they're probably
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:13.280]   going to get nothing for 10 years of work, whereas if they had just cut costs, the company has 32
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.320]   million of ARR. Imagine if they cut their opex to a million a month, they could have run $20
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:24.720]   million of EBITDA, pivot to the basic private equity model, sell that company for 150 million,
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.320]   half would have gone to pay off the investors and the other half would have gone, a lot of it would
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.360]   have gone to the common, they probably would have made $10 million each. Now they're going to get
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.520]   zero because they burnt too much money, didn't want to cut costs. They bought into the dream of
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.600]   bringing in the professional CEO who's going to reaccelerate growth. It never does. It's so
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.080]   frustrating to me because I feel so bad for these founders. I wish they had called me a year ago
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:49.600]   and I would have been one of the guys pounding on the table, "Just cut costs."
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.880]   And then control your destiny.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.200]   Because listen, yes. And here's the thing is, if you're only growing 10, 15, 20%,
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:01.520]   or even 50% a year, you're not a VC backable startup. You're a private equity play. So you
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:06.880]   got to pivot to that model of making your business work as a cash flow positive business. That's how
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.920]   you're going to get an exit. And if you're growing 100% plus a year, you can continue to be VC back.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.400]   So it's so important for founders to understand whether they're even eligible for venture capital
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.960]   anymore. And if they're not, you have to make a different kind of model work if you want to
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.840]   see a return.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.560]   Yeah. And when this happens, a cram down round,
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.120]   those founders, if they want a refresh, they have to prove their worth. They're not just going to
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.840]   get a refresh to keep the relationship going. This is $30 million in revenue. They don't need
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.720]   the founders anymore.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.360]   Look, these guys have been working for 10 years. So even if they got a refresh,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.760]   they had to put in four more years of work. And the other thing is this cram down round,
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.440]   I think was way too big. They raised 25 million with a three x lick breath.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.800]   So 75 million off the top,
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.280]   Off the top, then you got to repay back.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.560]   The VIG is triple?
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.700]   Yep.
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:01.040]   Oh my God, who this is where board governance is so important. Shemot, huh? Like, I mean,
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.760]   who is on the board of these companies? We told
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.920]   Unfortunately, I was not on the board.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.520]   Idiots are on the boards of these companies. These are people who've never had to build a company.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.800]   And they may be educated, or they may have been an exec at a company and then some VC who was
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:24.240]   feverishly raising funds, just hired some dope, put them on the board of this company.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.960]   And then just the stupidity compounds and trickles down.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.840]   It's so frustrating.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.040]   Compounding stupidity.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:33.360]   This is the beginning of the beginning. All of these people who have zero judgment are
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.680]   going to fuck so many companies up. It is the beginning of the beginning.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.000]   And Shemot, it's not just the bad board members. It's the view for so many years that who you put
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.840]   on your board didn't matter. And remember, there was all these VCs who had a model where it's like,
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.080]   well, we don't take a board seat. And they were selling that to founders as a positive.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.040]   As a feature.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.680]   As a feature, not a bug. And the reality is for a lot of
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.840]   VCs, actually not being on the board probably is the best they can offer. But, you know,
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.600]   that model works. That model works when everything is up and to the right, where like this model of
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.720]   board seats don't matter.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.920]   Governance doesn't matter.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.760]   That is a model in a boom where everything just keeps going up and to the right. But when you
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:19.600]   had a tough time, that is when you need a board member who's seen this movie before, who knows
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:25.600]   what a cram down round is, who knows what's going to happen to you a year hence, when you get
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.760]   screwed into taking a three exit breath.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.800]   It's where you want the gray haired pilot, you know, in the right seat to say, hey, listen,
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.120]   we're going into some-
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.160]   Yeah, you want this hair. You want this puffy hair.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.720]   You want that hair. You want that sexier. All right, Freiburg, you are always candid about
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.400]   your own journey. You've had huge wins, climate.com for a billy, raising funds, but you know,
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.080]   sometimes things don't work out. What do you what's your take on some of these hard lessons
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.880]   of great ideas, you know, spun up during this really hard market?
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.800]   I mean, I think just to echo the point you guys are making in the last
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:03.440]   15 years, we've been in a call it structurally inflated environment because of the zero
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.400]   interest rate policy since the financial crisis. And everything's been up into the writer so much,
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.840]   it's been so easy to kind of inflate things, fill up hot air balloons and go up into the right.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.840]   And unfortunately, most folks who are working in the investor community that are sitting on
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.960]   boards weren't around for the.com crash the last time this happened. And I think, you know, just
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.480]   to kind of echo your point why it's so challenging, I think right now to figure out a way out.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:33.840]   There are, there's a lot of failure going on in in Silicon Valley right now, you know,
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.160]   sacks, you talk a little bit about having paths for exit and options for SAS companies, but there
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.400]   are many sectors in startup land that don't have those sorts of options in biotech, in sin bio,
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.960]   in FinTech, and direct to consumer e commerce. There's a lot of markets that a lot of types of
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.800]   businesses that feel like there isn't a great way out. And it's having a deep psychological toll
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:03.200]   on entrepreneurs on founders on CEOs, and everyone is experiencing some degree of failure in this
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.440]   environment. There are very few folks who aren't feeling this acute pressure and this acute pain.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:12.560]   You know, I heard some pretty horrific stories this week from a friend of mine and someone who
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.240]   ended up in the hospital because of the pressure he was under. And it's really trying and you know,
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:22.400]   even within our friend group, I mean, not not our direct friend group within our broader community
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.160]   of investor friends. There are very few people who aren't feeling this extraordinary pressure that
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.160]   they've got a book that is declining in value, and they don't know how to get out of the hole.
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:40.640]   And you know, that pressure is like, is generates deep questions about one's ability and generates
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   deep existential thought for entrepreneurs and investors about what the hell am I good at.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:52.160]   And no one's really talking about this out loud. But it is a happening across the valley. We all
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:57.440]   have these thoughts. We all have these dialogues. As the failure begins to set in, in the slow
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.840]   motion train wreck of a market that we've all been talking about for weeks and months, how do you
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.080]   deal with it? Look, I mean, I just think that number one, it's worth acknowledging, and it's
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.480]   worth having the conversation that no one is alone going through this pain. It is not a one off that
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:16.880]   these companies are failing, it is that we are all dealing with failure right now. And we are all
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.000]   trying to figure out what is the best path forward. And it is the kind of thing that you just have to
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.160]   work your way through and you have to persist through this pain. But this existential question
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:31.680]   of Am I good enough? Do I have the skill set I thought I had? Am I just an idiot? Did I blow it
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.640]   up? Emperor has no clothes, all the kind of inner fear and turmoil that everyone's dealing with,
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.960]   you're not alone going through it. A lot of entrepreneurs, a lot of investors are in the
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.800]   exact same place. Now, with respect to going forward, I think having integrity with respect
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.280]   to how you handle these situations and having thoughtfulness about, you know, your reputation,
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:57.120]   because this is not a one and done environment here in Silicon Valley. failure is part of the
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:03.280]   process. And how you deal your deal, deal with people deal with investors deal with entrepreneurs
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.520]   deal with each other deal with your employees during these difficult times says a lot about
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:12.160]   your character and your ability, that when you do this, the next time, it will set you up for
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.920]   success. And you know, as any great athlete will tell you, you build muscle during the times that
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.840]   you're failing, and then you're ready to go and execute the next time around. So you know, let's
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:27.280]   save it for the next quarter. But let's play well as best we can right now, through this quarter,
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:33.600]   Chamath clearly, you want to jump in here. What are your thoughts on separating your identity from
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.480]   your startup from your work and having a more balanced view of yourself so that when things go
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:44.000]   wrong, maybe you're not as devastated, you don't wind up in a hospital bed when things go wrong.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:52.400]   They go wrong in bunches. Just like when things go right, they tend to go right in bunches.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.520]   I called free bird last week, and I was telling him a story
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:07.200]   about two or three of my businesses just all just pounding eating dirt. And what I said to him was,
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:16.720]   and then we have a mutual investment that's doing pretty well. And I needed to use the one that was
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.640]   doing well to make myself feel better about the three that were eating dirt. And I said to him
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.920]   something he liked, it's just like nothing is working. I feel like literally nothing is working
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:34.000]   and a place to be. The only thing that you can do in those moments is just realize it would be so
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:40.560]   much worse to just be on the sidelines. Oh, I like it. And I think that's all you can do. Then you go
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:48.400]   and hang out with your friends. Go hang out with your family, kiss your wife, have as good of a
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.720]   time as possible outside the context of work, and then you just start the grind again. But yeah,
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:59.680]   we are in a moment where in most companies, there is something pretty wrong. It's either your burn
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:07.040]   product, your track customers team, cap structure and riff cap table. Yeah. And by the way,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.600]   that's always the problem. But it tends to be balanced by a few things in your portfolio that
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:19.360]   are always going well. So that as an investor, you can maintain some equanimity through the
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.080]   whole process. But freeberg is right when there aren't enough of these positives, and there's just
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.600]   a parade of terribles. You're just like, wow, this whole portfolio. Is it all about to fail?
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.080]   And then I get a massive wave of imposter syndrome of like, what am I doing here? And then I have to
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:41.840]   recognize, holy shit, this is my 24th year. Take a deep breath. And it's great that it's that
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.040]   exhilarating where I think it's back to 2000. I just emigrated here. That's the conversation
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.280]   Samantha and I had beautiful talking about like a string of difficult things we're all dealing with,
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.200]   you know, a couple weeks ago, we announced that we returned all the money to all our
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.840]   customers at Canada, which was this molecular beverage printer company I've been working on
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.280]   for a few years. I plowed north of $30 million of our capital into building this business. We
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.880]   had two term sheets last year, both of which vaporized as the markets that degraded it was
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.440]   really a brutal experience for me. And these were very high valuations. And we were, we needed
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.760]   funding to get the production line stood up to manufacture that device. So we were that close.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.400]   I mean,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:26.400]   and as the market went south, pre revenue hardware companies became less fundable. And despite our
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.480]   reputation and a great working product and a product and a manufacturing ready prototype,
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:33.840]   we couldn't get it done. It was a really kind of brutal experience to go through
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.000]   the nose, even after you've had a lot of success in your life, believe it or not,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.480]   you still get a lot of friggin nose. And you get a lot of I don't believe us. And then to just have
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:45.440]   to get to a point with this one was really difficult. And there's, you know, been other
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.760]   kind of frustrating experiences of late. And then, you know, you kind of have a call one day
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:54.080]   with another investment. And you're like, Oh, my God, this thing could be a home run.
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.800]   And that just comes out of nowhere. And, you know, as long as we kind of stay in it,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.760]   as an investor, and you keep, you know, as a builder, and you kind of keep building,
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.800]   you don't know when that good knock on the door is going to come.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.960]   Yep. You got to stay in the game.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.520]   You got to stay in the game.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.920]   Building a business, and one day you just nail a sale that you just weren't expecting or a
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.680]   partnership, or an M&A inbound or something that happens that you weren't expecting, it pays for
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.800]   all the pain, and all the loss and all the turmoil and all the downside. I always used to tell people,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.960]   for every, you know, four days, I'd be failing, I'd have one day of success. But that one day of
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.680]   success will get me slightly ahead of where I was at the start of the week. But 80% of it was failing.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.760]   I mean, right now, it's like 19 days of failure and one day of success. But that one day of
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.360]   success, the goal is used to have a couple of those punctuated moments that are big enough
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.720]   that make up for all this stuff. If you just keep grinding, and if you just keep grinding as an
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.720]   entrepreneur, you keep grinding as an investor and stay in the game, lives with the power law,
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.360]   you're describing living with the power law.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.800]   There's a very relatable poker analogy in this. There's a there's a guy that makes
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.880]   poker content. His name is Jonathan Little.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.800]   He's great. He'll be at the Angel Summit.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.960]   He's wonderful. I've been thinking about hopping into one tournament at the WSOP this year.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.720]   It's one of the big buying tournaments. So I'm like, let me just take a little tournament
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.640]   refresher. And I was just looking for any content and I found his and he had this beautiful slide,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:24.080]   which he said, if you are a mid level poker player, you should expect to final table
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:33.040]   every one in 100 tournaments, roughly. And I thought about that for a second. And I was like,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:39.680]   that's a 1% success rate. Now, if that is your 99th tournament, you have to be pretty resilient
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:44.800]   to go through 98 losses where you don't cash, you don't make the money, and you're just putting
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.560]   money out, you're deep in a J curve. And you're like, is this ever going to work out for me?
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:52.800]   And so it's a really, really good reminder that it is the grind.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.600]   Yep.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.080]   And I thought that was really interesting.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.680]   So you had a single or double, I guess, with call in, maybe you could talk a little bit about that
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.560]   experience and what decision you made there. We were obviously investors. So we're a bit conflicted,
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.440]   but I'd love to hear your candid thoughts on why you decided to sell.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:13.360]   Yeah, we put together a great team, and they built an amazing product. I think it's by far
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:17.840]   the best sort of social audio product. And then actually, they added video to it as well
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.200]   and podcasting features. So it's kind of the synthesis of video and audio podcasting with
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.320]   social audio, we got acquired by rumble, it's sort of like a base hit type acquisition. It's,
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.200]   it's a small deal, relatively speaking, but the team wanted to do it. And then the main reason is
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.320]   because we got to hundreds of 1000s of users, but in the consumer space, you really need to get to
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:44.080]   millions. And frankly, 10s of millions is what it takes to have a successful consumer product.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:50.880]   Rumble does have 10s of millions of users. So the team wanted to find a home. And there's a lot of
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:56.640]   synergy with rumble. Both companies have a mission that's aligned around free speech rumble sort of
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:02.960]   the call it free speech alternative to YouTube. So video platform. And what Colin will do is give
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.880]   rumble studio capability. So it'll be very synergistic for all their creators to be able to
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:14.160]   create content in call and then post it in rumble. So it's not, you know, a huge outcome for anyone,
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.200]   it's sort of a push for the investors, depending on where rumble stock ends up. But look, it's just
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.760]   you can build a really great product and a great team. But unless you hit that lighting a bottle
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.240]   of distribution, you know, you won't get to the next level. So I'm happy about the deal. I think
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.280]   the team's happy about the deal. And it's a good outcome for for everybody involved. But it's not
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.040]   you know, it's not a home run. It's just, it's more of a base head. And that's what most of these
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:43.840]   things are. Yeah, getting used to a high failure rate, and living inside the power law where one
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:50.640]   investment out of 30 or 40 or 50 results in 90% of your funds returns for you know, that specific
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:56.720]   fund or so or maybe two wins represent 95% that's a hard thing for the human brain to handle as is
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:02.000]   the J curve as Chamath you know, points out correctly, man, you invest for two or three
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.600]   years and then you watch all those things go down in value for two or three years of the value I'm
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.840]   sure of the portfolio go down for two or three years before it actually rebounds and goes back
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.200]   up. I remember, man, I had a run where everything I touched turned to gold. And then Mahalo hit 10
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.200]   million in revenue and then boom, Panda update. And it just goes up in smoke. And you're like,
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:24.080]   what what just happened? I saw weblogs 18 months after starting it I you know, had the
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:29.440]   Silicon I report I just Uber investment everything I touched went to the moon working. Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.520]   And then it's just a very frustrating experience where you can't make something work. And you know,
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.160]   like, I should be able to make this work. Why isn't it working?
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:41.360]   There's a very heavy blanket of humility setting over Silicon Valley right now. And I think all of
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:47.120]   us who have had strings of successes and repeat successes and you know, things that we touch have
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.440]   worked, and we do all the same things and we do the right things and we do them the same way in
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.200]   the right way. And it doesn't work and then it doesn't work again. And then it doesn't work
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.880]   again. It creates a very different psyche, whether you're an entrepreneur building a business or an
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:05.920]   investor investing in businesses, that what used to be the case isn't the case anymore as the tides
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:12.800]   have shifted. It's, it's a daunting challenge to work your way psychologically through this moment.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:18.720]   But you know, progress doesn't change. Innovation isn't going to stop technology isn't going to keep
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:25.360]   shifting forward. And the opportunities to continue to build and innovate are not going away. So I for
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.520]   one am deeply optimistic and excited about what the future holds. But man, you got to put your
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.440]   freaking game face on right now to get through this. Yeah, for sure. Well, yeah. And I would
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.720]   say there's one other exogenous variable here, which is I don't think any of us realized how much
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:46.640]   our sentiment was affected by one guy's decision at the Fed. Yeah, like what interest rates are
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.960]   going to be visible hands. Yeah, because you know what, when there's a lot of money in the system,
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.600]   everyone feels great. And all the portfolios look great. And when the money is being sucked out of
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:00.080]   the buyers are buying and oh my god, like when the money is being sucked out of the system,
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.400]   everyone's results look terrible. Yep. It's you know, it's like before a tsunami,
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.000]   the big wave gets pulled out and then this tsunami comes in. Yeah, it's literally we're
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.120]   getting sold out. The money is being sucked out of the system like the tide before tsunami and
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:17.840]   tsunami is gonna be all the failures and bankruptcies. But what I would say is just in the
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:23.600]   same way that things weren't as good as they appear to be during the asset bubble. They're
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:28.720]   probably not as bad as they appear to be now. However, you have to give yourself time to get
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:34.880]   through this recessionary cycle. And it's so frustrating to me when founders don't want to cut
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.480]   their burn. The burn is the one thing they totally control. And they have all these excuses for why
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.440]   they can't cut to an earlier level spending that they were the company was working fine at. And we
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:51.440]   can't get them to go back to cut back to some earlier state of being. Zuckerberg can do it,
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.080]   they can do it. And you know, after seeing what Elon did at Twitter, where he reduced the staff
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:01.600]   by 80%. I'm like, I realized there's no good excuse anymore. Yep. We're not giving yourself
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:07.440]   the maximum chance of survival. And if you overcut, like he admits he probably did he literally in the
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.400]   the Dave Farber great interview he did with him. He said, you know, like, we probably overcut,
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:18.080]   we cut people who are great. And we hopefully can welcome them back to Twitter as we get this thing
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.480]   on stable footing. But we're gonna make mistakes because we had an existential crisis. Elon Musk
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.720]   cut too many people admits it and says he's gonna bring them back. It's no fault of theirs. And he
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.280]   said he's going back into growth mode. So you know, like sometimes you cut, you might cut too
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.880]   deep is the point. And you know, that sets you up for growth in the future. Chamath you had something
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.160]   you wanted to add. I have two shout outs. Okay, here we go. The first is to one of our besties
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:44.960]   got a text from Jason Kuhn. He binked the main event at the Triton for two and a half million.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:52.000]   Yeah. I mean, he's so strong. He's a guy's a beast. So it's so great to have a professional
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.120]   poker player in our circle. Finally, like somebody who's consistently over time, we can learn from
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:04.000]   Yeah, like, but he's so open and he teaches us around him, you know, rationally stable, rational,
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.640]   humble, humble, professional poker player, like happens to basically be the best poker player in
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.920]   the world. But you could you would never know it. You'd never know. He'd never bring it up. Like
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:17.600]   he is literally the greatest and he won the Triton 2.5 milli. Yeah, the second the second
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:26.880]   shout out is, here we go to the Model Y team at Tesla. I have been a diehard Model X user
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:32.400]   from the beginning. Right? I think I had here we go number 13. So I've been I've been I've had three
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.440]   or four of these things. And I was like, Wait a minute, maybe this why is really all it's cracked
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.440]   up to be and I'm a bit of a curmudgeon and I have high expectations. But I just want to say,
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.960]   that car kicks absolute ass. It is perfect. In cretino. It is incredible that model why
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.280]   is going to be the best selling car. Yeah, it's going to be the best selling car in America.
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:58.320]   If you get the base level, it's actually cheaper than the average car in America now with incentives.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:05.520]   Yeah, it's so, so good. So huge shout out 300 miles range, huge, huge, huge shout out to the
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:12.800]   Model Y team at Tesla, you guys nailed it. Yeah, it's an incredible product. And we I love it. I
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.480]   don't want to diminish the x. I don't want to diminish the x either. But the y is so snappy.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.360]   It's incredible. It's the best car ever made. It is the best. Yeah, it's a great car. It's a great,
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:27.680]   great car. I can't wait for the Cybertruck. That thing looks like a beast. I can't wait to take
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:34.000]   that up. I love the roadster. I love the roadster. You know, I've been taking my 12 year old roadster
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.760]   out. And my kids love going for ice cream in the the original roadster 1.0. So I've been taking it
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.120]   out every weekend or two. Number one, you have number 16 of the roadster, which somebody offered
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.560]   me a quarter million dollars for I paid 160 for it. I have number one of the Model S signature
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:54.960]   series. So I have signature 16 of roadster, they did 100 signatures, and they did 1000 signatures
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.880]   of the Model S. And I have number one of that and somebody offered me a million dollars for that
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.680]   I have number of the founders edition number 13 of the x. Yeah, that's pretty special. Yeah,
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:09.040]   I'd hold on to that. Yeah, there. It's a special vehicle. All right. Listen, everybody.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.400]   All in summit is basically so how are we doing? How's the all in summit doing guys?
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.600]   We're starting to do our outreach and figure out speakers. Yes. Yeah. So it's exciting.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:27.120]   All right, everybody for the Sultan of science, the dictator, and Steve Bannon 2.0 David Sacks,
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:34.800]   the architect, the architect, the architect, I like that I remain. Even after sex is triumphant
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:39.120]   spaces, I remain the world's greatest moderator. So excited for this weekend, boys.

[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.760]   Your winners ride.
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.640]   Rain Man David Sacks.

[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:56.080]   Love you.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:57.120]   West Queen of
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:57.360]   King.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.600]   Besties are gone.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.280]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:13.840]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:18.880]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.840]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.480]   What you're about to be.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.840]   We need to get Merchies are gone.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:40.960]   I'm going all in. I'm going all in.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.460]   you
[01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:51.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
