[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   - Much of your passions in life has been
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960]   through something you might be able to call work.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.080]   Alan Watts has this quote.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.640]   He said that the real key to life,
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   secret to life is to be completely engaged
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.680]   with what you're doing in the here and now.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.440]   And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.040]   So I'd like to ask, what is the role of work
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.720]   in your life's journey or in a life's journey?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.160]   And what do you think about this modern idea
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.200]   of kind of separating work and work-life balance?
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.320]   - I have a principle that I believe in is
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.640]   make your work and your passion the same thing.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.360]   So that's similar view.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.480]   In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.080]   it's just gonna work out great.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.960]   And then of course, people have different purposes of work.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.760]   And I don't wanna be theoretical about that.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.080]   People have to take care of their family.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   So money at a certain point is an important component
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.800]   of that work.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   So you look beyond that.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.320]   What is the money gonna get you
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.160]   and what are you trying to achieve?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.920]   But the most important thing, I agree,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.760]   is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.440]   Like if you can get into the thing that you're,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.600]   your mission that you're on,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.920]   and you are excited about that mission that you're on,
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.480]   and then you can do that with people
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   who you have the meaningful relationships with.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   You have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080]   I mean, that is fabulous for most people.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.720]   - And it seems that many people struggle to get there,
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   not out of, not necessarily because they're constrained
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.320]   by the fact that they have the financial constraints
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.840]   of having to provide for their family and so on.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.160]   But it's, I mean, you know, this idea is out there
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   that there needs to be a work-life balance,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.920]   which means that most people,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.640]   and we're gonna return to the same thing,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880]   is most doesn't mean optimal,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   not be, not unifying work and passion.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.320]   Why do you think that is?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.840]   - Well, the work-life balance,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.060]   there's a life arc that you go through.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   Starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.920]   and there is a phase, and there's a,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   and you could look at the different degrees of happiness
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.960]   that happen in those phases.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.680]   I can go through that if that was interesting,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.720]   but we don't have time probably for it.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.260]   But you get in the part of the life,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.400]   that part of the life which has the lowest level
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.680]   of happiness is age 45 to 55.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.680]   And because as you move into this second phase of your life,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.480]   now the first phase of your life
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.040]   is when you're learning dependent on others.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.800]   Second phase of your life is when you're working
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560]   and others are dependent on you,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.640]   and you're trying to be successful.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   And in that phase of one's life,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.520]   you encounter the work-life balance challenge,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.080]   because you're trying to be successful at work
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.360]   and successful at parenting and successful and successful
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.160]   and all those things that take your demand.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.680]   And they get into that, and I understand that problem
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.400]   in the work-life balance.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.160]   The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.240]   So I understand it's stressful, it produces stress,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.760]   and it produces bad results,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.200]   and it produces the lowest level of happiness in one's life.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   It's interesting, as you get later in life,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.820]   the levels of happiness rise,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.960]   and the highest level of happiness
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   is between ages 70 and 80,
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.500]   which is interesting for other reasons.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.440]   But in that spot, and the key to work-life balance
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.060]   is to realize and to learn
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.800]   how to get more out of an hour of life, okay?
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.880]   Because an hour of work,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   between one thing and another, and of course they do,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.360]   but they don't realize that if they develop the skill
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.400]   to get a lot more out of an hour,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.740]   it's the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.540]   And so, that's why in the book "Principles"
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.120]   I try to go into, okay, now how can you get a lot more
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.160]   out of an hour that allows you to get more life
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.080]   into your life, and it reduces the work-life balance.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.460]   - And that's the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.220]   If you could linger on that,
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.940]   so what are the ups and downs of life
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.020]   in terms of happiness in general,
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.020]   and perhaps in your own life
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.660]   when you look back at the moments, the peaks?
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.100]   - It's pretty much the same pattern.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.460]   Really in one's life tends to be a very happy period
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.700]   all the way up, and 16 is like a really great happy,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.980]   you know, I think, like myself,
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.460]   you start to get elements of freedom,
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.740]   you get your driver's license, whatever,
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.740]   but 16 is there.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.620]   Junior year in high school quite often
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.340]   could be a stressful period to try to get,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.820]   thinking about the high school.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.340]   You go into college, tends to be very high happiness,
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.500]   generally speaking.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.340]   - Freedom.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.020]   - And then freedom, yeah, friendships,
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.260]   all of that freedom is a big thing.
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.260]   And then 23 is a peak point kind of in happiness.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.700]   That freedom.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.040]   Then sequentially one has a great time,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.620]   they date, they go out, and so on,
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.960]   you find the love of your life,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.600]   you begin to develop a family,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.460]   and then with that as time happens,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.060]   you have more of your work-life balance challenges
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.140]   that come and your responsibilities,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.940]   and then as you get there in that mid part of your life,
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.540]   that is the biggest struggle.
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.780]   Chances are you will crash in that period of time.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.680]   You'll have your series of failures, that's that.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.580]   That's when you go into the abyss.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.060]   You learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.500]   you have a metamorphosis, you come out, you change,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.580]   you hopefully become better,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.260]   and you take more responsibilities and so on.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.800]   And then when you get to the later part
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.600]   as you are starting to approach the transition
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.580]   in that late part of the second phase of your life
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.260]   before you go into the third phase of your life,
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.820]   second phase is you're working, trying to be successful.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.660]   Third phase of your life is you want people
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.460]   to be successful without you, okay?
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.700]   - Yes.
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.940]   - You want your kids to be successful without you
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.420]   because when you're at that phase,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.540]   they're making their transition from the first phase
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.020]   to the second phase, and they're trying to be successful,
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.940]   and you want them to be successful without you,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.580]   and you have, your parents are gone,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.660]   and then you have freedom, and then you have freedom again.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.220]   And with that freedom, and then you have these,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.820]   history has shown with this, you have friendships,
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.700]   you have perspective on life, you have different things,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.260]   and that's one of the reasons that that later part
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.780]   of the life can be real.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.200]   On average, actually, it's the highest.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.700]   Very interesting thing.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.180]   If they, there are surveys, and say,
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.620]   "How good do you look, and how good do you feel?"
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.940]   And that's the highest survey.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.500]   The person, now they're not looking the best,
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.260]   and they're not feeling the best, right?
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.140]   Maybe it's 35 that they're actually looking the best
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.580]   and feeling the best, but they rank the highest
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.220]   at that point, survey results of being the highest.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.060]   - That's so fascinating.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.300]   - In that 70 to 80 period of time,
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.300]   because it has to do with an attitude on life.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.860]   Then you start to have grandkids, oh, grandkids are great,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.760]   and you start to experience that transition well.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.860]   So that's what the arc of life pretty much looks like,
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.020]   and I'm experiencing it, you know?
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:08.860]   - You've lived it.
