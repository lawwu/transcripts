[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   I try and talk about these things in the here and now because it's such a trope to say that
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.500]   nobody is on their deathbed and wishes they worked harder and spent more time at work.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.840]   People always wish they spent more time with their family and friends.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.580]   Like it's such a joke, but it's like nobody thinks the house is going to burn down when
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.580]   they buy insurance.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.120]   We're terrible long-term planners.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.400]   People are terrible at saving money because nobody thinks they're going to need it until
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   it's too late.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.880]   We have to talk to people in the here and now, right?
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   Let's get them where they are.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880]   Are you the happiest you can be?
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.800]   Do you feel like you've got someone who's got your back?
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.860]   Do you feel like you can call someone when you're not doing well and that they have the
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.760]   skill set to know how to hold space?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.480]   Do you ever get people to call to brag about how freaking amazing you are and they share
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.000]   in the joy with you and big up you and make you feel even better?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.480]   Or do you have to keep it to yourself because you're kind of embarrassed that you're going
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.880]   to be that guy to your friends?
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.560]   Just ask yourself these questions if you have any of these people in your life.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.680]   And if the answer is no to any of them, then maybe a little work is required.
