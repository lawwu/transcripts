[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620]   The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin,
[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.360]   co-creator of and author of the white paper
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.480]   that launched Ethereum and Ether,
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.880]   which is a cryptocurrency that is currently
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.640]   the second largest digital currency after Bitcoin.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640]   Ethereum has a lot of interesting technical ideas
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.600]   that are defining the future of blockchain technology.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.320]   And Vitalik is one of the most brilliant people
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.040]   innovating in the space today.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.560]   Unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown person or group
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.160]   that created Bitcoin, Vitalik is very well known
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.080]   and at a young age is thrust into the limelight
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.840]   as one of the main faces of the technology
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.520]   that may redefine the nature of money
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.180]   and all forms of digital transactions in the 21st century.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.920]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.360]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.080]   review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,

[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.620]   at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.760]   As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.120]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.280]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.680]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   Quick summary of the ads.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   Two sponsors, Masterclass and ExpressVPN.

[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.400]   When I first heard about Masterclass,
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.060]   I honestly thought it was too good to be true.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.840]   For $180 a year, you get an all access pass
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.920]   to watch courses from experts at the top of their field.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.800]   To list some of my favorites,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   Chris Hadfield on space exploration,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.520]   Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840]   and communication, Will Wright, the creator of Sim City
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.500]   and Sims on game design.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.080]   I love that game.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   Jane Goodall on conservation,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.640]   Carlos Santana, one of my favorite guitarists on guitar,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   Garry Kasparov on chess.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.020]   Obviously I'm Russian, I love Garry.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.060]   Daniel Negrano on poker, one of my favorite poker players,
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   also Phil Ivey gives a course as well, and many, many more.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.300]   Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.420]   and the experience of being launched into space alone
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.140]   is worth the money.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.220]   By way of advice, for me, the key is not to be overwhelmed
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.420]   by the abundance of choice.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420]   Pick three courses you want to complete,
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.800]   watch each all the way through from start to finish.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's not that long, but it's an experience
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.160]   that will stick with you for a long time, I promise.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.680]   It's easily worth the money.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.260]   You can watch it on basically any device.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.280]   Once again, sign up at masterclass.com/lex
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.120]   This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.580]   Download it at expressvpn.com/lexpod

[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.820]   I've been using ExpressVPN for many years.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.780]   I honestly love it.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.160]   It's easy to use, press the big power on button
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.860]   and your privacy is protected.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.400]   And if you like, you can make it look like
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.820]   your location is anywhere else in the world.
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.320]   I might be in Boston now, but I can make it look
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.780]   like I'm in New York, London, Paris, or anywhere else.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.400]   This has a large number of obvious benefits.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.900]   For example, certainly it allows you to access
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.360]   international versions of streaming websites
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.060]   like the Japanese version of Netflix
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.520]   or the UK version of Hulu.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   As you probably know, I was born in the Soviet Union.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720]   So sadly, given my roots and appreciation
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.640]   of Russian history and culture, my website
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.360]   and the website for this podcast is blocked in Russia.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.440]   So this is another example of where you can use ExpressVPN
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.100]   to access sites like the podcast
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.680]   that are not accessible in your country.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.900]   ExpressVPN works on any device you can imagine.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.640]   I use it on Linux, shout out to Ubuntu, Windows, Android,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.180]   but it's available everywhere else too.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.180]   Once again, download it at expressvpn.com/lexpod
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.640]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.060]   And now here's my conversation
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.940]   with Vitalik Buterin.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.100]   So before we talk about the fundamental ideas
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.440]   behind Ethereum and cryptocurrency,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.060]   perhaps it'd be nice to talk about
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.640]   the origin story of Bitcoin
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.360]   and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.860]   You gave a talk that started with sort of asking the question
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.020]   what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent?
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.360]   Maybe you could say who is Satoshi Nakamoto
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.060]   and what did he invent?
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.060]   - Sure, so Satoshi Nakamoto is the name
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.240]   by which we know the person
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.780]   who originally came up with Bitcoin.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.200]   So the reason why I say the name by which we know
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.600]   is that this is an anonymous fellow
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   who has shown himself to us only over the internet
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.980]   just by first publishing the white paper for Bitcoin,
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.520]   then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.560]   and then talking to the very early Bitcoin community
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.980]   on Bitcoin forums and interacting with them
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.900]   and helping the project along for a couple of years.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.900]   And then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011,
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.600]   he disappeared.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.100]   So Bitcoin is a fairly unique project
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.440]   in how it has this kind of mythical,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.240]   a kind of quasi-godlike founder
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.120]   who just kind of popped in and did the thing
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.240]   and then disappeared and we've somehow
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.080]   just never heard from him again.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.800]   - So in 2008, so the white paper was the first,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.820]   do you know if the white paper was the first time
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.360]   the name would actually appear, Satoshi Nakamoto?
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.700]   - I believe so.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.780]   - So how is it possible that the creator
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.480]   of such a impactful project remains anonymous?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.760]   - That's a tough question.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.920]   And there's no similarity to it in history of technology
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   as far as I'm aware.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.160]   - Yeah.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.800]   So one possibility is that it's Hal Finney
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   because Hal Finney was kind of also active
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.480]   in the Bitcoin community as Hal Finney
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   in those two beginning years.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   And Hal--
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.600]   - Who is Hal Finney maybe?
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   - He is one of the people in the early Cypherpunk community.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.480]   He was--
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.560]   - So he's a computer scientist, just one of the--
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.160]   - Yeah, computer scientists, cryptographers,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   people interested in technology, internet freedom,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.720]   like those kinds of topics.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   - Is it correct that I read that he seemed
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.160]   to have been involved in either the earliest
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.720]   or the first transaction of Bitcoin?
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   - Yes.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.680]   The first transaction of Bitcoin
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.440]   was between Satoshi and Hal Finney.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.440]   - Do you think he knew who Satoshi was?
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   If he was--
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.240]   - If he wasn't Satoshi, probably no.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.040]   - How is it possible to work so closely with people
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.000]   and nevertheless not know anything
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.560]   about their fundamental identity?
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   Is this like a natural sort of characteristic
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.480]   of the internet?
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.800]   Like if we were to think about it,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.760]   'cause you and I just met now,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.360]   there's a depth of knowledge that we now have
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.960]   about each other that's like physical.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.360]   Like my vision system is able to recognize you.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.560]   I can also verify your identity of uniqueness.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.400]   - Yep.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.560]   - Like it's very hard to fake you being you.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400]   - Yes.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.200]   - So the internet has a fundamentally different quality
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.680]   to it, which is just fascinating.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.520]   Can you maybe talk to that?
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.040]   - Yeah, no, this is definitely interesting
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   as I definitely just know a lot of people
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.960]   just by their internet handles.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   And to me, when I think of them,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.480]   like I see their internet handles
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.120]   and one of them has a profile picture
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.840]   of this kind of face that's kind of not quite human
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.960]   with a bunch of kind of psychedelic colors in it.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.240]   And when I visualize him, like I just visualize that.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.400]   - That, not an actual face.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.760]   - Yeah.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.560]   - You are the creator of the second,
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.400]   well, at least currently,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.880]   the second most popular cryptocurrency, Ethereum.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.160]   So on this topic, if we just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.880]   for a little bit longer,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   you may be the most qualified person to speak
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.640]   to the psychology of this anonymity
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.000]   that we're talking about.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.480]   Like your identity is known, like I've just verified it.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.160]   But from your perspective,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.520]   what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.160]   and then remaining anonymous?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.600]   Like if it can psychoanalyze Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.120]   is there something interesting there?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.200]   Or is it just a peculiar quirk of him?
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.360]   - It definitely helps create this kind of image
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   of this kind of neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.400]   That you've created a project
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   and because you're anonymous
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.840]   and because you also have disappeared,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.920]   or as unfortunately happened to Halfini, if that is him,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.840]   he ended up, I think, dying of Lou Gehrig's disease
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.080]   and he's in the cryogenic freezer now.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   But like if you pop in and you created and you're gone
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.360]   and all that's remaining of that whole process
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   is the thing itself,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   then no one can go and try to interpret
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.720]   any of your other behavior and try to understand like,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   oh, this person wrote this thing in some essay at age 16
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   where he expressed particular opinions about democracy.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.800]   And so because of that, this project is a statement
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.320]   that's trying to do this specific thing.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.520]   Instead it creates this environment
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.240]   where the thing is what you make of it.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.560]   And...
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.360]   - It doesn't have the, yeah, right.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.680]   The burden of your other ideas,
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.240]   political thought and so on.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.720]   So now that we're sitting with you,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   do you feel the burden of being kind of the face of Ethereum?
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.760]   I mean, there's a very large community of developers,
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.960]   but nevertheless.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.280]   - Yeah.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.120]   - Is there like a burden associated with that?
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.400]   - There definitely is.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.600]   This is definitely a big reason why I've been trying
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.360]   to kind of push for the Ethereum ecosystem
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.320]   to become more decentralized in many ways.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.840]   Just encouraging a lot of kind of core Ethereum work
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.120]   to happen outside of the Ethereum foundation
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.800]   and of expanding the number of people
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.720]   that are making different kinds of decisions,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.200]   having multiple software pollutations instead of one
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.280]   and all of these things.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.240]   Like there's a lot of things that I've tried to do too
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.640]   and remove myself as a single point of failure
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.240]   because that is something
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.360]   that a lot of people criticize me for.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.080]   - So if you look at like
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   the most fundamentally successful open source projects,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.720]   it seems that it's like a sad reality when I think about it
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   is it seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   Often you feel like a lioness for Linux, for the kernel.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.920]   - Yeah, that is possible.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   I'm definitely not planning to disappear.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.600]   - That's an interesting tension
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.240]   that projects like this kind of desire a single entity
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.480]   and yet they're fundamentally distributed.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.000]   I don't know if there's something interesting to say
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.320]   about that kind of structure
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.000]   and thinking about the future of cryptocurrency.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.560]   Does there need to be a leader?
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.160]   - There's different kinds of leaders.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.640]   There's dictators who control all the money.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.880]   There's people who control organizations.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.800]   There's kind of high priests
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   that just have themselves and their Twitter followers.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   - What kind of leader are you, would you say?
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.520]   - Yeah, in these days,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.800]   I actually a bit more in the high priest direction
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.640]   than before.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.200]   I definitely actually don't do all that much
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   of kind of going around
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.080]   and ordering Ethereum Foundation people to do things
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.600]   because I think those things are important.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.240]   If there's something that I do think is important,
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   I do just usually kind of say it publicly
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.920]   or just kind of say it to people.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.960]   Quite often projects just gonna start doing it.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   - So let's ask the high philosophical question about money.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.080]   What at the highest level is money?
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.960]   What is money?
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   - It's a kind of game.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.200]   And it's a game where we have points.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.000]   And if you have points,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.960]   there's this one move where you can reduce your points
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.640]   by a number and increase someone else's points
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.960]   by the same number.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.040]   And these--
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.000]   - So it's a fair game, hopefully.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.080]   - Well, it's one kind of fair game.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.800]   Like for example, you can have other kinds of fair games.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.920]   Like you're gonna have a game
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.280]   where if I give someone a point
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.400]   and you give someone a point,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.080]   then instead of that person getting two points,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.720]   that person gets four points.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.920]   And that's also fair.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.000]   But money is easy to kind of set up
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.560]   and it serves a lot of useful functions.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.240]   And so it kind of just survives in society
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.640]   as a meme for thousands of years.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.560]   - It's useful for the storage of wealth.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.880]   It's useful for the exchange of value.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.400]   - And it's also useful for denominating future payments,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.640]   a unit of account.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.360]   - A unit of account.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.800]   So what, if you look at the history of money
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.160]   in human civilization,
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.840]   just if you're a student of history,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.880]   how has its role or just the mechanisms of money
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.800]   changed over time in your view?
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.640]   Even if we just look at the 20th century or before
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.560]   and then leading up to cryptocurrencies,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.160]   that's something you think about?
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.320]   - Yeah, and I think the big thing in the 20th century
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.280]   is kind of, we saw a lot more intermediation, I guess.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.520]   The first part is kind of the move from adding
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.480]   more of different kinds of banking.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   And then we saw the move from dollars being backed by gold
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.520]   to dollars being backed by gold
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.200]   that's only redeemable by certain people
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.400]   to dollars not being backed by anything
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.280]   to this system where you have a bunch
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.800]   of free floating currencies
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   and then people getting bank accounts
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.680]   and then those things becoming electronic,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.560]   people getting accounts with payment processors
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.760]   that have bank accounts.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.080]   - So what do you make of that?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.080]   That's such a fascinating philosophical idea
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.880]   that money might not be backed by anything.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.400]   Is that fascinating to you,
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.360]   that money can exist without being backed
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.440]   by something physical?
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.880]   - It definitely is.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.440]   - Like what do you make of that?
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.360]   Like how is that possible?
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.280]   Is that stable?
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   If we look at the future of human civilization,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.360]   is it possible to have money at the large scale
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.880]   at such a hugely productive and rich societies
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.600]   be able to operate successfully
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   without money being backed by anything physical?
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.880]   - I feel like the interesting thing
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.560]   about the 21st century especially
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.680]   is that a lot of the important valuable things
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.200]   are not backed by anything.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.040]   Like if you look at tech companies for example,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.200]   something like Twitter,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.400]   you could theoretically imagine
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.200]   that if all of the employees wanted to,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.840]   they could kind of come together,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.760]   they would quit and start working on Twitter 2.0
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   and then the value of,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.840]   and just kind of build the exact same products
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.680]   or possibly build a better product
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.320]   and then just kind of continue on from there
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.680]   and the original Twitter
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.480]   would just not have people left anymore.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.080]   There is theoretically kind of code and IP
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.240]   that's owned by the company,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.960]   but in reality, good programmers
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.600]   could probably rewrite all that stuff in three months.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   So the reason why the thing has value
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.360]   is just kind of network effects
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.880]   and coordination problems.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.240]   Like these employees in reality
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.640]   aren't going to switch all at once
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.360]   and also the users aren't all going to switch at once
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.880]   because it's just difficult for them to switch at once.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.760]   And so there's these kind of meta stable
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.160]   and of equilibria in interactions
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.200]   between thousands of millions of people
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.480]   that are just actually quite sticky,
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.440]   even though if you try to kind of assume
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.040]   that everyone's a perfectly rational
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.240]   and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow,
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.840]   they don't seem to exist at all.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.920]   - That stickiness, do you have a sense,
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.000]   a grasp of the sort of the fundamental dynamic,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.280]   like the physics of that stickiness?
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.480]   It seems to work,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.280]   but and I think some of the cryptocurrency ideas
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.960]   kind of rely on it working.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.760]   - Yeah, it's the sort of thing
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.240]   that's definitely been economically modeled a lot.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.920]   One of the kind of analogy of something as similar
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.080]   that you often see in textbooks
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.880]   as like what is a government?
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.680]   Like if for example, like 80% of people in a country
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.840]   just like tomorrow suddenly had the idea
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.160]   that like the laws that are currently,
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.000]   the laws in the government
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.960]   that currently is the government
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.600]   are just people in some other thing is the government
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.120]   and they just kind of start acting like it,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.600]   then that would kind of become the new reality.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.720]   And then the question is, well,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.800]   what happens if kind of between zero
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.960]   and 80 people or an 80% of people start believing that?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.800]   And like, what is the thing you see is that
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.520]   if there is one of these kind of switches happening
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.600]   is kind of revolution,
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.080]   then if you're the first person to join,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.040]   then like you probably don't have the incentive to do that.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.280]   But then if you're the 55th percentile person to join,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.480]   then suddenly becomes quite safe too.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.440]   And so it's definitely is the sort of thing that you can
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.040]   kind of try to analyze and understand mathematically.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   But one of the kind of results is that the sort of
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.560]   like when the switch happens
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.080]   definitely can be chaotic sometimes.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.480]   - Yeah, but still like to me,
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.520]   the idea that the network affects the fact that
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.080]   human beings at a scale of like millions, billions
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   can share even the idea of currency, like all agree.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.200]   That's just, I know economics can model it.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.040]   I'm a skeptic on the economic.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.000]   And it's like, so my favorite sort of field
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.880]   maybe recreationally psychology
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.960]   is trying to understand human behavior.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.640]   And I think sometimes people just kind of pretend
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.140]   that they can have a grasp on human behavior,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.760]   even though it's such a messy space
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.200]   that all the models that psychology or economics,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.440]   those different perspectives on human behavior
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.240]   can have are difficult.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.640]   It's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.760]   and how much it is actually getting to the core
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.240]   of understanding human behavior.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.560]   But on that idea,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   what do you think is the role of money in human motivation?
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.840]   So do you think money from an economics perspective,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:17.080]   from a psychology perspective is core to like human desires?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.980]   Money is definitely very far from the only motivator.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.500]   It is a big motivator.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.260]   And that's one of the closest things you have
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.800]   to a universal motivator.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:33.300]   Because ultimately in like almost any person in the world,
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.900]   if you ask them to do something,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.580]   like there'll be more inclined to do it
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.660]   if you also offer them money, right?
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.740]   And that's like, there's definitely many cases
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.380]   where people will do things other than things
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.940]   and maximize how much money they have.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.260]   And that happens all the time.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.140]   But like a lot of those other things
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.220]   are kind of much more specific to
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.740]   and of who that person is and of where their situation is,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.780]   the relationship between the motive and the action
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.300]   and these other things.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.660]   - What do you think is the interplay of the other motivator
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.780]   from like Nietzsche perspective is power?
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   Do you think money equals power?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.900]   Do you think those are conflicting ideas?
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.340]   Do you think, I mean, that's one of the ideas
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.740]   that decentralized currency,
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.940]   decentralized applications are looking at
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.780]   is who holds the power?
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.860]   - Yeah, money is definitely a kind of power.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.900]   And there's definitely people who want money
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.300]   because it gives them power.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.300]   And then even if money doesn't seem to
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.260]   kind of explicitly be about money,
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.620]   a lot of things that people spend money on
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.380]   are ultimately about a social status of some kind.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.780]   So I definitely view those two things as kind of interplaying.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.780]   And then there's also money as just a way of like
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.620]   measuring how successful you are, like as a scoreboard, right?
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.540]   So this kind of gets back to the game.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.140]   I mean, like if you have $4 billion,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.140]   then the main benefit you get from going up,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.580]   or one of the big benefits you get
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.900]   from going up to $6 billion is that now,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.460]   instead of being below the guy who has five,
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.020]   you're above the guy who has five.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.260]   - So you think money could be kind of,
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.900]   in the game of life, it's also a measure of self-worth.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.660]   It's like how we-
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.220]   - It's definitely how a lot of people perceive it.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.700]   - Define ourselves in a hierarchy of society.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.780]   - Yeah, not saying it's sort of a healthy thing
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.380]   that people define their self-worth as money,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.380]   'cause it's definitely far from a perfect indicator
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.500]   of how much value you provide to society
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.380]   or anything like this.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.420]   But I definitely think that as a matter
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.500]   of kind of current practice,
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.260]   a bunch of people do feel that way.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.380]   - So what does utopia,
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.860]   from an economic perspective, look like to you?
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.300]   What does a perfect world look like?
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.300]   - I guess the economists say utopia would be one where
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.540]   kind of everything is incentive aligned
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.460]   in the sense that there aren't enough conflicts
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.220]   between what satisfies your goals
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.380]   and kind of what is good for everyone
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.740]   in the world as a whole.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.700]   - What do you think that would look like?
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.820]   Does that mean there's still poor people and rich people?
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.380]   There's still income inequality?
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.420]   Do you think sort of Marxist ideas are strong?
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.900]   Do you think sort of ideas of objectivism,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.220]   like where the market rules is strong?
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.300]   Is there different economic philosophies
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.220]   that just seem to be reflective of what utopia would be?
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:56.620]   - So I definitely think that existing economic philosophies
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:01.180]   do end up kind of systematically deviating
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.540]   from the utopia in a lot of ways.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.740]   Like one of the big things I talk about, for example,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.860]   is public goods, right?
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.100]   And public goods are especially important on the internet.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.740]   Because like the idea is with kind of money as this game
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.820]   where I lose a few coins and you gain the same number
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.980]   of coins is that this usually happens in a trade
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.380]   where I lose some money, you gain some money,
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.780]   you lose a sandwich and I gain a sandwich.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.940]   And this kind of model works really well
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.980]   when the thing that we're using money to incentivize
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.340]   this set of private goods, right?
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.180]   Things that you provide to one person
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.740]   where the benefit comes to one person.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.740]   But on the internet especially,
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.100]   but also many, many contexts kind of off the internet,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.540]   there's actions that kind of individuals or groups can take
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.340]   where instead of the benefit going to one person,
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.980]   the benefit just goes to many people at the same time
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.820]   and you can't control who the benefit goes to, right?
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.460]   So for example, this podcast, we publish it
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.780]   and when it's published,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.740]   you don't have any fine grains control over like,
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.460]   oh, these 38,000 people can watch it
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.220]   and then like these other 29,000 people can't.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.900]   It's like once the number goes high enough,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.340]   then people will just copy it.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.100]   And then when I write articles on a blog,
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.540]   then they're just like free for everyone
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.380]   and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:32.940]   So aside from that, things like scientific research,
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.420]   for example, and even taking more pedestrian examples
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.940]   like climate change mitigation would be a big one.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.420]   So there's a lot of things in the world
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.940]   where you have these kind of individual actions
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.420]   with enough concentrated costs and distributed benefits
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.820]   and money as a point system
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.700]   does not do a good job of encouraging these things.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.380]   And one of the kind of other things
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.340]   even tangentially connected to crypto,
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   but kind of theoretically outside of it that I work on
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.540]   is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.140]   And the way to think about it is,
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.140]   and if imagine a point system where if one person
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:21.820]   gives coins to one other person,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.580]   then it works the same way as money.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.500]   But if multiple people give coins to one person
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.060]   and they do so anonymously,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.100]   so it's kind of not in consideration
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.820]   for a specific service to that person themselves,
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.020]   then the number of coins received by that person
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.540]   is greater than just the sum of the number of coins
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.300]   that have given by those different people.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.060]   So the actual formula is you take the square root
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.580]   of the amount that each person gave,
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.780]   then you add all the square roots
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.500]   and then you had a square of the sum.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.100]   - Yeah, and then you give that.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.220]   And the idea here would basically be that if,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.860]   let's say for example,
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.180]   you just started going off and kind of planting
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.020]   a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.180]   that are really happy that you're planting trees
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.020]   so they go and all kind of throw a coin your way,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.380]   then there is like basically the fact
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.940]   that kind of you get more than the sum,
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.380]   you get this kind of square of some of these,
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.660]   of square roots of these tiny amounts
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.100]   is that this actually kind of compensates
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.260]   for the tragedy of the commons, right?
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.940]   There's even this kind of mathematical proof
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.260]   that it sort of optimally compensates for it.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.020]   - What is the tragedy of the common?
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   - This is just this idea that if there is this situation
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.820]   where there's some public good
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.340]   that lots of people benefit from,
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.180]   then no individual person wants to contribute to it
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.140]   'cause if they contribute,
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.100]   they only get a small part of the benefit
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.180]   from their contribution,
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.780]   but they pay the full cost of their contribution.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.720]   - In which context is this,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.500]   sorry, what is the term, quadratic what?
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.580]   - Quadratic funding.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.780]   - Quadratic funding.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:05.700]   Like what's, in which context is this mechanism useful?
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.780]   So obviously you said to combat
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.860]   the tragedy of the commons,
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.380]   but in which context do you see it as useful
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.220]   actually practically speaking?
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.580]   - Yeah, theoretically public goods in general, right?
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.940]   So like--
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.100]   - Like services, like what are we talking about?
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.940]   What's a public good?
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.180]   - Yeah, so within the Ethereum ecosystem, for example,
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.740]   we've actually tried using this mechanism.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.540]   I wrote a couple of articles about this
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.700]   and on vitalik.ca where I go through
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.020]   some of the most recent rounds
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.060]   and it's been really interesting.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.380]   Some of the top ones that people supported,
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.380]   there were things like just online user interfaces
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:48.420]   that make it easier for people to interact with Ethereum.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.540]   There was documentation, there were podcasts,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:58.820]   there were software and of clients,
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.140]   like kind of implementations of the Ethereum protocol
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.020]   of privacy tools, just like lots of things
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.260]   that are useful to lots of people.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.140]   - When a lot of people are contributing,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.660]   like funding a particular entity,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.260]   that's really interesting.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.220]   Is there something special about the quadratic,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.300]   the summing of the square roots and the taken square?
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.260]   - So another way to think about it is like,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.140]   imagine if N people each give a dollar,
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.780]   then the person gets N squared, right?
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.900]   And so each individual person's contribution
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.220]   gets multiplied by N, right?
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.420]   'Cause you have N people.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.740]   And so that kind of perfectly compensates
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.980]   for the kind of N to one tragedy of the commons.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.340]   - I just wonder if the squared part is somehow fundamental.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.460]   - No, it is.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.620]   And I'd recommend you go to, on Vitalik.ca,
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.940]   I have this article called "Quadratic Payments, a Primer"
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.140]   and highly recommend it.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.420]   It's kind of, at least my attempt so far,
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.340]   kind of explaining the intuition behind this.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.300]   - Intuition.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.980]   So if we could, can we go to the very basic?
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.820]   What is the blockchain?
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.620]   Or perhaps we might even start
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.620]   at the Byzantine Generals problem
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.060]   and Byzantine fault tolerance in general
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:23.060]   that Bitcoin was taking steps to providing a solution for.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.220]   - So the Byzantine Generals problem,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:33.220]   it's this paper that Leslie Lamport published in 1982,
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.020]   where he has this thought experiments
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.500]   where if you have two generals
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.140]   that are kind of camped out on opposite sides of a city
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.220]   and they're planning when to attack the city,
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.380]   then the question is,
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.180]   and if how could those generals coordinate with each other?
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.380]   And they could send messengers between each other,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.780]   but those messengers could get sniped
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.300]   by the enemy on the road.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.660]   Some of those messages could end up being traitors
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.860]   and if things could end up happening.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.860]   And with just two mess generals,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:13.220]   it turns out that there's kind of no solution
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.820]   in a finite number of rounds
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.660]   that guarantees that they will be able
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.100]   to end up coordinate on the same answer.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.900]   But then in the case where you have more than two generals,
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.140]   so then Leslie analyzes cases like,
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.740]   are the messages kind of just oral messages?
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.300]   Are the messages kind of signed messages?
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.420]   So I could give you a signed message
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.420]   and then you can pass along that signed message
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.340]   and the third party can still verify
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.100]   that I originally made that message.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.860]   And depending on those different cases,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.700]   there's kind of different bounds on,
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.020]   given how many generals and how many traitors
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.540]   among those generals,
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.340]   and under what conditions you actually can agree
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.100]   when to launch an attack.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.900]   So it's actually a big misconception
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.740]   that the Byzantine generals problem was unsolved.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.380]   So Leslie Lamport solved it.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.180]   The thing that was unsolved though,
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.700]   is that all of these solutions assume
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.220]   that you've already agreed on,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.620]   and have a fixed list of who the generals are.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.820]   And these generals have to be kind of semi-trusted
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.660]   to some extent.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.780]   They can't just be anonymous people
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.900]   because if they're anonymous,
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.940]   then like the enemy could just be 99% of the generals.
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.940]   So in the 1980s and the 1990s,
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:34.260]   kind of the general use case for distributed systems stuff
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.860]   was more kind of enterprising stuff
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.820]   where you could kind of assume that,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.900]   you know who the nodes are
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.220]   that are running these kind of computer networks.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.100]   So if he wants to have some kind of
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.500]   decentralized computer network
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.260]   that pretends to be a single computer
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.380]   and that you can kind of do kind of operations on,
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.500]   then it's made out of these kind of 15 specific computers.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.900]   And we know kind of who and where they are.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.540]   And so we have a good reason to believe
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.020]   that say at least 11 of them would be fine.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.100]   - And it could also be within a single system.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.020]   - Exactly.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.300]   - Almost a network of devices, sensors,
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.180]   so on like in airplanes.
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.940]   And I think like flight systems in general
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.660]   still use these kinds of ideas.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:18.820]   - Yep, yep.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.260]   - So that's the 80s.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.540]   - That's the 80s and 90s.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.580]   Now the cypherpunks had a different use case in mind,
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.980]   which is that they wanted to create
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.100]   a fully decentralized global permissionless currency.
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.260]   And the problem here is that
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.540]   they didn't want any authorities
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.300]   and they didn't even want any kind of
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.260]   privileged list of people.
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.660]   And so now the question is,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.660]   well, how do you use these techniques to create consensus
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.100]   when you have no way of kind of measuring identities, right?
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.700]   You have no way of kind of determining
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.420]   whether or not some 99% of participants
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.340]   aren't actually all the same guy.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.180]   And so the clever solution that Satoshi had,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.700]   this is kind of going back to that presentation
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.220]   I made at DEF CON a few months ago,
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.740]   where I said that the thing Satoshi invented
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.660]   was crypto economics,
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   is this really neat idea that you can use economic resources
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.140]   to kind of limit how many identities you can get.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.620]   And if there isn't any existing
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.380]   decentralized digital currency,
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.900]   then the only way to do this is with proof of work, right?
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.700]   So with proof of work, the solution is just
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:36.580]   you publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.900]   that takes some kind of clearly calculable amount
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.020]   of computational power to solve, you get an identity.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.980]   And then you solve five of those puzzles,
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.580]   you get five identities.
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.540]   And then these are the identities
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.140]   that we run the consensus algorithm between.
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.820]   - So the proof of work mechanism you just described
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.940]   is like the fundamental idea proposed
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:01.940]   in the white paper that defines Bitcoin.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.180]   What's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach?
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.060]   Why is consensus important here?
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.900]   What is consensus?
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   - So the goal here in just simple technical terms
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.180]   is to basically kind of wire together
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.740]   a set of a large number of computers
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.940]   in such a way that they kind of pretend
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.300]   to the outside world to be a single computer
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.580]   where that single computer keeps working
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.340]   even if a large portion of the kind of constituents
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.220]   the computers that make it up break.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.860]   And kind of break in arbitrary ways.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   Like they could shut off,
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.940]   they could try to actively break a system,
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.980]   they could do lots of mean things.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   So the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.460]   is because they wanted to run one particular program
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.900]   on this virtual computer.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.100]   And the one particular program that they wanted to run
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.620]   is just a currency system, right?
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.780]   It's a system that just processes a series of transactions.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.300]   And for every transaction it verifies
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.140]   that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.660]   and verifies that the digital signature is correct.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.620]   And if the checks pass then it subtracts the coins
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.900]   from one account and adds the coins
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.380]   to the other account roughly.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:20.500]   - So first of all, the proof of work idea is kind of,
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.580]   I mean, at least to me seems pretty fascinating.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.420]   - It is.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.940]   - I mean, that's a, it's kind of a revolutionary idea.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.340]   I mean, is it obvious to come up with
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.100]   that you can use, you can exchange
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.940]   basically computational resources for identity?
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.780]   - It actually has a pretty long history.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.460]   It was first proposed in a paper by Cynthia Dwork
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:51.180]   and Nixon Naylor in 1994, I believe.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.740]   And the original use case was combating email spam.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.420]   So the idea is that if you send an email,
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.340]   you have to send it with a proof of work attached.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.820]   And like this makes it reasonably cheap
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.060]   to send emails to your friends,
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.380]   but it makes it really expensive
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.660]   to send spam to a million people.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.580]   - Yeah, that's a simple, brilliant idea.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.460]   So maybe also taking a step back.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.460]   So what is the role of blockchain in this?
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.980]   What is the blockchain?
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.660]   - Sure, so the blockchain, my way of thinking about it
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.260]   is that it is this kind of system
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.580]   where you have this kind of one virtual computer
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   created by a bunch of these nodes in the network.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.980]   And the reason why the term blockchain is used
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.180]   is because the data structure that these systems use,
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.460]   at least so far, is one where they,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.540]   different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.100]   And a block is a kind of list of transactions
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.580]   together with a pointer, like a hash of a previous block
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.140]   that it builds on top of.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.580]   And so you have a series of blocks
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.180]   that nodes in the network create
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.940]   where each block points to the previous block.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.820]   And so you have this chain of them.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.820]   - Is a fault tolerance mechanism
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.340]   built into the idea of blockchain
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.100]   or is there a lot of possibilities of different ways
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.220]   to make sure there's no funny stuff going on?
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.460]   - There are indeed a lot of possibilities.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.180]   So in a kind of just simple architecture,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.180]   as I just described,
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.340]   the way the fault tolerance happens is like this, right?
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.500]   So you have a bunch of nodes
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.020]   and they're just happily and occasionally creating blocks,
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.940]   building on top of each other's blocks.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.220]   And let's say you have kind of one block,
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.660]   we'll call it kind of block one.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.060]   And then someone else builds another block,
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.820]   honestly, we'll call it block two.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.900]   Then we have an attacker.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.420]   And what the attacker tries to do
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.780]   is the attacker tries to revert block two.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.140]   And the way they revert block two
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.340]   is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do,
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.740]   which is build a block on top of block two,
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.620]   they're gonna build another block on top of block one.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.700]   So you have block one, which has two children,
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.700]   block two and then block two prime.
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.420]   Now, this might sometimes even happen by random chance
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.860]   if two nodes in the network
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.700]   just happen to create blocks at the same time
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.700]   and they don't hear about each other's things
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.100]   before they create their own.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.020]   But this also could happen because of an attack.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.740]   Now, if this happens, you have an attack,
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:22.580]   then in the Bitcoin system,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.940]   the nodes follow the longest chain.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:29.420]   So if this attack had happened
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.660]   and when the original chain had more than two blocks on it,
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.180]   so if it was trying to kind of revert
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.580]   more than two blocks,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.460]   then everyone would just ignore it
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.940]   and everyone would just keep following the regular chain.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.460]   But here, we have block two and we have block two prime
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.300]   and so the two are kind of even.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:52.060]   And then whatever block the next block is created on top of,
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.220]   so say block three is now created on top of block two prime,
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.860]   then everyone agrees that block three is the new head
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.300]   and block two prime is just kind of forgotten
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.980]   and then everyone just kind of peacefully builds
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.020]   on top of block three and the thing continues.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.460]   - So how difficult is it to mess with the system?
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.180]   So how, like if we look at the general problem,
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.420]   like how many, what fraction of people
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.180]   who participate in the system have to be bad players
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.460]   in order to mess with it truly?
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.220]   Like what's your, is there a good number?
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.820]   - There is.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.460]   Well, depending on kind of what your model
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.620]   of the participants is
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.580]   and like what kind of attack we're talking about,
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   it's anywhere between 23.2 and 50%.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.780]   - Of what?
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.100]   - Of all of the computing power in the network.
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.660]   - Sorry, so 22 and 50.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.780]   - Between 23.2 and 50%.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.820]   - And 50% can be compromised.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.820]   - So like once your portion of the total computing power
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.780]   in the network goes above the 23.2 level,
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.220]   then there's kind of things that you can,
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:07.540]   mean things that you can potentially do
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.340]   and as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up,
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.540]   then your ability to do mean things kind of goes higher
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.100]   and then if you have above 50%,
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.860]   then you can just break everything.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.820]   - So how hard is it to achieve that level?
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.940]   Like it seems that so far, historically speaking,
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.060]   it's been exceptionally difficult.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.620]   - This is a challenging question.
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.700]   So the economic cost of acquiring that level of stuff
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.580]   from scratch is fairly high.
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.460]   I think it's somewhere in the low billions of dollars.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.020]   - And when you say that stuff,
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.140]   you mean computational resources?
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.980]   - Yeah, so specifically specialized hardware
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.180]   and of ASICs that people use to solve these puzzles,
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.420]   to do the mining these days.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:52.340]   - Small tangent.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.380]   So obviously I work a lot in deep learning with GPUs
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.500]   and ASICs for that application.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.060]   And I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these,
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.340]   sometimes NVIDIA GPUs are sold out
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.500]   because of this other application.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.940]   Like what do, if you can comment,
[00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.580]   I don't know if you're familiar or interested in this space,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.060]   what kind of ASICs, what kind of hardware
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.980]   is generally used these days
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.540]   to do the actual computation for the proof of work?
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:22.340]   - Sure, so in the case,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.220]   and Bitcoin and Ethereum are a bit different.
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.340]   So in the case of Bitcoin,
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.580]   there is an algorithm called SHA-256,
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.060]   it's just a hash function.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.940]   And so the puzzle is just coming up with a number
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.500]   where the hash of the number is below some threshold.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.580]   And so, 'cause the hashes are designed to be random,
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.660]   you just have to keep on trying different numbers
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.180]   until one works.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.500]   And the ASICs are just like specialized circuits
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.100]   that contain kind of circuits
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.180]   for evaluating this hash over and over again.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.060]   And you have kind of like millions or billions
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.380]   of these hash evaluators
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.620]   and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.100]   And you just keep on running the box 24/7.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:00.940]   - And the ASICs,
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.260]   there's literally specialized hardware designed for this?
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.100]   - Yes.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.300]   - Wow, this is, we live in an amazing world.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.980]   Another tangent, and I'll come back to the basics,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   but does quantum computing throw a wrench into any of this?
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.260]   - Very good question.
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.260]   So quantum computers have two main families of algorithms
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.180]   that are relevant to cryptography.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.420]   One is a Shor's algorithm.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.620]   And Shor's algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.580]   the hardness of some specific kinds
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.100]   of mathematical problems.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.500]   So the one that you've probably heard of
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.340]   is it makes it very easy to factor numbers.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.380]   So like figure out kind of what prime factors are
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.180]   that kind of, that you need to multiply together
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.980]   to get some number, even if that number is extremely big.
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.060]   Shor's algorithm can also be used
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.940]   to break elliptic curve cryptography.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.940]   It can break like any kind of hidden order groups.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.300]   So it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.740]   that we're used to.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:04.460]   But the good news is that for every kind of major use
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.260]   of things that Shor's algorithm breaks,
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.740]   we already know of quantum proof alternatives.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.100]   Now we don't use these quantum proof alternatives yet
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.060]   because in many cases they're five to 10 times
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:20.060]   less efficient, but the crypto industry in general
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   kind of knows that this is coming eventually
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.980]   and that's kind of ready to take the hit
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.900]   and switch to that stuff when we have to.
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:32.380]   The second algorithm that is relevant to cryptography
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.860]   is Grover's algorithm.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.780]   And in Grover's algorithm might even be a bit more familiar
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.300]   to AI people that's basically usually described
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.380]   as solving search problems.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.500]   But the idea here is that if you have a problem
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:53.100]   of the form, find a number that satisfies some property,
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.380]   then if with a classical computer,
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.660]   you need to try out of N times before you find the number,
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.580]   then with a quantum computer,
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.700]   you only need to do a square root of N computations.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:09.700]   And Grover's could potentially be used for mining,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.940]   but there's two possibilities here.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.020]   One is that Grover's could be used for mining
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:19.100]   and whoever creates the first working quantum computer
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.820]   that could do Grover's will just mine way faster
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:22.660]   than everyone else.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.540]   And we'll see another round of what we saw
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.020]   when ASICs came out, which is that kind of the new hardware
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.780]   just kind of dominated the old stuff.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.420]   And then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.220]   - But by the way, way faster, not exponentially faster.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   - Quadratically faster.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.060]   - Quadratically faster, which is not sort of,
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.620]   it's not game changing, I would say.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.740]   It's like ASICs, like you said, it would be.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:46.700]   - Exactly.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   Yeah, so it would not necessarily break proof of work
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.780]   as a thing. - That's right, yeah.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.500]   The other kind of possible world, right,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.340]   is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.820]   There's a lot of complexity involved
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:00.340]   in maintaining quantum states.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.260]   And there's also, as we've been realizing recently,
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.180]   making quantum computers actually work
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.140]   requires sort of quantum error correction,
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:11.580]   which requires kind of a thousand real qubits
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.100]   per logical qubit.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.900]   And so there's the very real possibility
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.020]   that the overhead of running a quantum computer
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.940]   will be higher than the speedup you get with Grovers,
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.260]   which would be kind of sad, but which would also mean
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.540]   that the given proof of work would just keep working fine.
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.500]   - So, beautifully put.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.140]   So proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.420]   Is there other core ideas before we kind of
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.020]   take a step towards the origin story and ideas of Ethereum?
[00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.180]   Is there other stuff that were key
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.020]   to the white paper of Bitcoin?
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.980]   - There's proof of work,
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.780]   and then there's just the cryptography,
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.020]   just kind of public keys and signatures
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.900]   that are used to verify transactions.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.540]   Those two are the big things.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.580]   - So then what is the origin story?
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.980]   Maybe the human side,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.540]   but also the technical side of Ethereum.
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.380]   - Sure.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.900]   So I joined the Bitcoin community in 2011,
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.220]   and I started by just writing.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.140]   I first wrote for this sort of online thing
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.820]   called Bitcoin Weekly.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.820]   Then I started writing for Bitcoin Magazine.
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.340]   - Sorry to interrupt.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.180]   I'm just trying to figure out
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.420]   if this funny kind of story, true or not,
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:24.340]   is that you were disillusioned by the downsides
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.860]   of centralized control from your experience
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.580]   with, wow, World of Warcraft.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.420]   Is this true or you're just being witty?
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.860]   - I mean, the event is true.
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:34.100]   The fact that that's the reason
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.900]   I do decentralization is witty.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.580]   - Maybe just a small tangent.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.900]   Have you always had a skepticism of centralized control?
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.740]   Is that sort of--
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.180]   - To some degree, yeah.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.100]   - Has that feeling evolved over time
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:50.860]   or has that just always been a core feeling
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.460]   that decentralized control is the future of human society?
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:56.860]   - It's definitely been something
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.620]   that felt very attractive to me
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.900]   ever since I could have learned
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.500]   that such a thing is possible.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.180]   - It's possible even technically.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.020]   So great.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.620]   So you joined the Bitcoin community in 2011,
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:08.540]   you said you began writing.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.460]   So what's next?
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.100]   - Started writing,
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.140]   moved from high school to university
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.900]   halfway in between that,
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.220]   spent a year in university.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.820]   Then at the end of that year,
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.380]   I dropped out to do Bitcoin things full-time.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.820]   And this was a combination
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.700]   of continuing to write Bitcoin magazine,
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.420]   but also increasingly work on software projects.
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.500]   And I traveled around the world for about six months
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.820]   and just going to different Bitcoin communities.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.620]   Like I went to first in New Hampshire,
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.820]   then Spain, other European places,
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.100]   Israel, and then San Francisco.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.380]   And along the way, I've met a lot of other people
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.740]   that are working on different Bitcoin projects.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.580]   And when I was in Israel,
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.900]   there were some kind of very smart teams there
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.220]   that were working on ideas
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.780]   that people were starting to kind of call Bitcoin 2.0.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.420]   So one of these was covered coins,
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.220]   which is basically saying that,
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.580]   "Hey, let's not just use the blockchain for Bitcoin,
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.820]   but let's also issue other kinds of assets on it."
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.940]   And then there was a protocol called MasterCoin
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.980]   that supported issuing assets,
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.020]   but also supported many other things,
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.020]   like financial contracts, like domain name registration,
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.380]   and a lot of different things together.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:28.380]   And I spent some time working with these teams,
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.140]   and I quickly kind of realized
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.260]   that this MasterCoin protocol could be improved
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.220]   by kind of generalizing it more, right?
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.140]   So the analogy I use is that the MasterCoin protocol
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:41.420]   was like the Swiss Army knife.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.980]   You have 25 different transaction types
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.260]   for 25 different applications.
[00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.060]   But what I realized is that you could replace
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.300]   a bunch of them with things that are more general purpose.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.380]   So one of them was that you could replace
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.020]   like three transaction types
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.060]   for three types of financial contracts
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.860]   with a generic transaction type for a financial contract
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:06.180]   that just lets you specify a mathematical formula
[00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.700]   for kind of how much money each side gets.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.220]   - By the way, just a small pause.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.620]   What's, you say financial contract,
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.460]   just the terminology, what is a contract?
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.060]   What's a financial contract?
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.180]   - So this is just generally an agreement
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:24.700]   where kind of either one or two parties
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.140]   kind of put collateral kind of in,
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:31.980]   and then depending on kind of certain conditions,
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.940]   like this could involve prices of assets,
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:37.100]   this could involve the actions of the two parties,
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.100]   it could involve other things.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:43.140]   They kind of get different amounts of assets out
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.140]   that just depend on things that happened.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.620]   - So a contract is really,
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.700]   a financial contract is the core,
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.820]   it's the core interactive element of a financial system.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.260]   - Yeah, there's many different kinds of financial contracts.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.700]   Like there's things like options
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.660]   where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.180]   that you have for some specific price
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.300]   for some period of time.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.100]   There's contracts for difference
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.260]   where you basically are kind of making a bet
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.980]   that says like for every dollar this thing goes up,
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.500]   I'll give you $7 or for every dollar the thing goes down,
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.700]   you give me $7 or something like that.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.740]   - But the main idea that these contracts
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.940]   have to be enforced and trusted.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.500]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.580]   - You have to trust that they will work out
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.620]   in a system where nobody can be trusted.
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.460]   - Yes.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:34.060]   - This is such a beautiful, complicated system.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.940]   Okay, so you were seeking to kind of generalize
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.900]   this basic framework of contracts.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.580]   So what does that entail?
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:48.620]   So what technically are the steps to creating Ethereum?
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.940]   - Sure, so I guess just to kind of continue a bit
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.620]   with this MasterCoin story.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.180]   So started by kind of giving ideas
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.900]   for how to generalize the thing.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.780]   And eventually this turned into a much more
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.740]   kind of fully fledged proposal that just says,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.420]   hey, how about you scrap all your futures
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.340]   and instead you just put in this programming language?
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   And I gave this idea to them and their response
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.740]   was something like, hey, this is great,
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.620]   but this seems complicated and it seems like something
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.820]   that we're not gonna be able to put onto our roadmap
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.860]   for a while.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.580]   And my response to this was like, wait,
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.740]   do you not realize how revolutionary this is?
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.500]   Well, I'll just go do it myself.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.180]   And then I--
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.900]   - What was the name of the programming language?
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.500]   - I just called it ultimate scripting.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.620]   - Great.
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:38.540]   - So then I kind of went through a couple more rounds
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:42.420]   of iteration and then the idea for Ethereum itself
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.140]   started to form.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:49.140]   And the idea here is that you just have a blockchain
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:53.020]   where the core unit of the thing is what we call contracts.
[00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.900]   It's these kind of accounts that can hold assets
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.420]   and they have their own internal memory,
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.580]   but that are controlled by a piece of code.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.900]   And so if I send some ether to a contract,
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.180]   the only thing that can determine where that ether,
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:12.660]   the currency inside Ethereum goes after that
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.900]   is the code of that contract itself.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:20.580]   And so basically you're kind of sending assets
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:24.740]   to computer programs becomes this kind of paradigm
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:28.860]   for creating these sort of self-executing agreements.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.460]   - Self-executing, it's so cool that code
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.180]   is sort of part of this contract.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.540]   So that's what's meant by smart contracts.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.380]   - Yeah.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.540]   - So how hard was it to build this kind of thing?
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.380]   - Harder than expected.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.060]   And originally I actually thought that this would be a thing
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.140]   that I would kind of casually work on
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:48.500]   for a couple of months, publish,
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.060]   and then go back to university.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:55.940]   Then I released it and a bunch of people,
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.140]   or I released a white paper.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.540]   - The white paper, the idea is there.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.260]   - The idea, the white paper.
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.620]   A whole bunch of people came in offering to help,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.660]   a huge number of people have expressed interest.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.260]   And this was something I was totally not expecting.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.580]   And then I realized that this would be something
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.100]   that's kind of much bigger than I had ever thought
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.100]   that it would be.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:21.140]   And then we started on this kind of much longer
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.500]   development slog of making something that lives up
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.980]   to this much higher level of expectations.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.300]   - What are some of the,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.500]   is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges?
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.340]   - It was.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.380]   - Is there social, okay, so there's--
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:36.220]   - And social.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:39.820]   - So what are the biggest interesting challenges
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.100]   that you've learned about human civilization
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.020]   and software engineering through this process?
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:50.820]   - So I guess one of the challenges for me
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.860]   is that I'm one of the kind of apparently unusual geeks
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.940]   who has kind of never treated with anything
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.980]   but kindness in school.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:03.660]   And so when I got into crypto,
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.340]   I kind of expected everyone would just kind of be
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.980]   the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:14.980]   But the algorithm that I used for finding co-founders
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.180]   for this thing was not very good.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.060]   It was sort of literally what computer scientists
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.420]   called the greedy algorithm.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:23.220]   It's sort of the first 15 people who replied back
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.260]   offering to help kind of are the co-founders.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.140]   - So you mean like literally the people
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:32.780]   that will form to be the co-founders of the community,
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.060]   the algorithm, I like how you call it the algorithm.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:39.860]   - Yeah, and so what happened was that these,
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   like especially as the project got really big,
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.380]   like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.540]   and there were a lot of,
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:51.140]   like I wanted the thing to be a nonprofit
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.380]   and some of them wanted to be a for-profit.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:56.340]   And then there started to be people
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.780]   who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.860]   There were people that were kind of trying
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.340]   to get an advantage for themselves
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:05.900]   in a lot of different ways.
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.020]   And this just about six months later
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:11.980]   led to this big governance crisis.
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.900]   And then we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.100]   And then the project kept on going.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.700]   Then nine months later, there was another governance crisis.
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.540]   And then there was a third governance crisis.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:25.460]   And so is there a way to,
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.380]   if you're looking at the human side of things,
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:30.700]   is there a way to optimize this aspect
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.220]   of the cryptocurrency world?
[00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:35.300]   It seems that there is, from my perspective,
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.300]   there's a lot of different characters
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.500]   and personalities and egos.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.260]   And like you said, I don't know if,
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:47.260]   I also like to think that most of the world,
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.180]   most of the people in the world are well-intentioned,
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.140]   but the way those intentions are realized
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:56.340]   may perhaps come off as negative.
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:57:01.100]   Like what, is there a hopeful message here
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.340]   about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.860]   that where everyone gets along?
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.300]   - I mean, after about four rounds of reshuffle,
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.700]   like I think we've actually come up with something
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.020]   that seems to be pretty stable and happy.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:20.380]   I think, I mean, I definitely do think that
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.540]   most people are well-intentioned.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.100]   I just think that one of the reasons
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.780]   why I like decentralization is just because there's like
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.420]   this thing about power where power attracts people
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.540]   with egos and so that just allows us
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.940]   a very small percentage of people
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.820]   to just ruin so many things.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:42.260]   - You think ego has a, you think ego has a use?
[00:57:42.260 --> 00:57:44.780]   Like is ego always bad?
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:45.620]   It seems like some of the most--
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.580]   - It sometimes does.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.940]   But then the Ethereum research team,
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:52.940]   I feel like we've found also kind of a lot of very good
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:58.260]   people that are just primarily just interested
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.100]   in things for the technology
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:05.100]   and things seem to just generally be going quite well.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.740]   - Yeah, when the focus and the passion is in the tech.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.420]   So that's the human side of things.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:14.900]   The technology side, like what have you learned?
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.580]   What have been the biggest challenges
[00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:21.380]   bringing Ethereum to life on the technology side?
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.580]   - So I think first of all, just,
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.580]   you know, there's like the first law of software development
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.940]   which is that when someone gives you a timetable,
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.100]   I'm gonna switch the unit of time
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:34.500]   to the next largest unit of time and add one.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.940]   And we basically fell victim to that.
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:42.900]   And so instead of taking like three months,
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.700]   it ended up taking like 20 months to launch the thing.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.740]   And that was just, I think,
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.980]   underestimating the sheer technical complexity
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.820]   of the thing.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.140]   There are research challenges.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.300]   Like, so for example,
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.860]   one of the things that we've been saying
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.140]   from the start that we would do,
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:04.100]   one is a switch from a proof of work to a proof of stake.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.980]   More proof of stake is this alternative consensus mechanism
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.620]   where instead of having to waste a lot of computing power
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.180]   on solving these mathematical puzzles
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.180]   that don't mean anything,
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.900]   you kind of prove that you have access to coins
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.900]   inside of the system.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.260]   And this kind of gives you some level of participation
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.540]   in the consensus.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.260]   - Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit?
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.220]   I understand the idea of proof of work.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:29.740]   I know that a lot of people say
[00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.980]   that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.700]   Can you maybe link on it a little longer,
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.380]   explain what it is?
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.460]   - Sure.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:40.260]   So basically the idea is like,
[00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.220]   if I kind of lock up a hundred coins,
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.180]   then I turn that into a kind of quote virtual miner
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.500]   and the system itself kind of automatically
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.540]   and randomly assigns that in a virtual miner
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:58.220]   the right to create blocks at particular intervals.
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.340]   And then if someone else has 200 coins
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.540]   and they lock on the lock, there's 200 coins,
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.620]   then they get a kind of twice as big virtual miner,
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.380]   they'll be able to create blocks twice as often.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.100]   So it tries to do similar things to proof of work,
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.220]   except instead of the thing
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.860]   and of rate limiting your participation
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.380]   being your ability to crank out solutions
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.420]   to kind of hash challenges,
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.180]   the thing that really limits your participation
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.220]   is kind of how much coins
[01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.980]   you're kind of locking into this mechanism.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.820]   - Okay, so interesting.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   So that limited participation
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.860]   doesn't require you to run a lot of compute.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.780]   Does that mean that the richer you are,
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:46.540]   so rich people are more,
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   like their identity is more stable,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.220]   verifiable or whatever the right terminology is.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.500]   - Right, and this is definitely a common critique.
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.620]   I think my usual answer to this is that
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.060]   like proof of work is even more of that kind of system.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.900]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.220]   I didn't mean it in that statement as a criticism.
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.300]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.260]   That's equivalent.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.020]   The proof of work is the same kind of thing,
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.020]   but in the proof of work,
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.740]   you have to also use physical resources.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.060]   - Yes, and burn computers and burn trees
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.340]   and all of that stuff.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:22.220]   - Is there a way to mess with the system
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.100]   over the proof of stake?
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.980]   - There is, but you will once again need to have
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.660]   a very large portion of all the coins
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.740]   that are locked in the system to do anything bad.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.580]   - Got it.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.820]   Yeah, and just that maybe take a small change.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.780]   One of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.140]   that I guess for the proof of work mechanism,
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.140]   you have to use so much energy in the world.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.340]   - Yes.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.020]   - Is one of the motivations of proof of stake
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.780]   is to move away from this?
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.620]   - Definitely.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.500]   - Like what's your sense of the,
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.300]   maybe I'm just under-informed.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.220]   Is there like legitimately environmental impact from this?
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.700]   - Yeah, so the latest thing was that Bitcoin consumed
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.700]   as much energy as the country of Austria
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.380]   or something like that.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.660]   Yeah, and then Ethereum is like right now,
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.180]   only like half an order of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.820]   - I've heard you talk about Ethereum 2.0.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.340]   So what's the dream of Ethereum 2.0?
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.300]   What's the status of proof of stake as a mechanism
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:24.340]   that Ethereum moves towards?
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.060]   And also, how do you move to a different mechanism
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.740]   of consensus within a cryptocurrency?
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:35.900]   - So Ethereum 2.0 is a collection of major upgrades
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.700]   that we've wanted to do to Ethereum for quite some time.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:41.900]   The two big ones, one is a proof of stake
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.300]   and the other is what we call sharding.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.940]   Sharding solves another problem with blockchains,
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.780]   which is a scalability.
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.020]   And what sharding does is it basically says,
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.620]   instead of every participant in the network
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.020]   having to personally download
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.780]   and verify every transaction,
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.060]   every participant in the network only downloads
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.660]   and verifies a small portion of transactions.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.940]   And then you kind of randomly distribute
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.980]   who gets how much work.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.940]   And because of how the distribution is random,
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.380]   it still has the property that you need a large portion
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.020]   of the entire network to corrupt what's going on
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.380]   inside of any shard,
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.940]   but the system is still very redundant and very secure.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.500]   - That's brilliant.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.700]   How hard is that to implement
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.580]   and how hard is proof of stake to implement?
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.020]   Like on the technical level, software level.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.500]   - Proof of stake and sharding are both challenging.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.220]   I'd say sharding is a bit more challenging.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.020]   The reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.540]   to how the consensus layer works.
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.580]   Sharding does both that,
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.260]   but it's also a change to the networking layer.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.220]   The reason is that sharding is kind of pointless
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.060]   if at the networking layer, you still do what you do today,
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.700]   which is you kind of gossip everything,
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.260]   which means that if someone publishes something,
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.860]   every other node and the client hears it
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.980]   from on the networking layer.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.380]   And so instead we have to have kind of sub networks
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.540]   and the ability to quickly switch between sub networks
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.740]   and other sub networks, talk to each other.
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.780]   And this is all doable,
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.820]   but it's a more complex architecture
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.660]   and it's definitely the sort of thing
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.100]   that has not yet been done in cryptocurrency.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.380]   - So most of the networking layer in cryptocurrency
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.620]   is you're shouting, you're like broadcasting messages.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.180]   And this is more like ad hoc networks.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.860]   - Yeah, you're shouting within smaller groups.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.100]   - Smaller group, but do you have like a bunch of sub net?
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.300]   - Exactly.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.660]   - Then you have to switch between,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.580]   oh man, I'd love to see that.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.180]   So it's a beautiful idea.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:39.900]   So from a graph theoretic perspective,
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.140]   but just the software, like who's responsible?
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.660]   Is the Ethereum project, like the people involved,
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.700]   would they be implementing?
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.060]   Like what's the actual,
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.340]   you know, this is like legit software engineering.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.660]   Who, like how does that work?
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.340]   How do people collaborate, build that kind of project?
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.380]   Is this like almost,
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:03.700]   like is there a software engineering lead?
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.180]   Is there, is it a legit,
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.500]   almost like large scale open source project?
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.420]   - There is, yeah.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.980]   So we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team
[01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.500]   who has just been brilliant and great all around.
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.020]   And he is a kind of de facto
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:22.180]   kind of development coordinator, I guess.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.020]   It's like, you have to invent job titles for this stuff.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   The reason is that,
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.700]   like we also have this unique kind of organizational
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.860]   structure where the Ethereum Foundation itself
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.140]   kind of does research in-house,
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.860]   but then the actual implementation is done
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.380]   by independent teams that are separate companies
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.900]   and they're located all around the world
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.860]   and like fun places like Australia.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   And so, you know, you kind of just need a bunch of
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.420]   kind of almost nonstop cat herding to just
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.740]   keep getting these people to kind of talk to each other
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.540]   and kind of implement the spec,
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.580]   make sure that everyone agrees on kind of what's going on
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.060]   and kind of how to interpret different things.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.780]   - So how far into the future are we
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.380]   from these two mechanisms in Ethereum 2.0?
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.460]   Like what's your sense of the timeline,
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.420]   keeping in mind the previous comment you made
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.260]   about the sort of general curse of software projects?
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.460]   - So Ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.460]   So phase zero just creates a proof of stake network
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.740]   and it's actually separate from kind of proof of,
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.660]   the proof of work network at the beginning,
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.100]   just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.860]   - Do people get to choose, sorry to interrupt,
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.420]   do people get to choose, I guess, which-
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:42.020]   - Yes, they get to choose to move over if they want to.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.020]   Then phase one adds sharding,
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.660]   but it only adds sharding of kind of data storage
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.980]   and not sharding of computation.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.940]   And then after that, there is kind of the merger phase,
[01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:56.940]   which is where the accounts, kind of smart contracts,
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.060]   like all of the kind of activity
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.380]   on the existing ETH1 system,
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.900]   just kind of gets cut and pasted into ETH2.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.660]   And then the proof of work chain gets forgotten.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.540]   And then all the things that were living there before
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.980]   just kind of continue living
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.300]   inside of the proof of stake system.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.300]   So for timelines, phase zero has been,
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:23.300]   kind of almost fully implemented.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.940]   And now it's just a matter of a whole bunch
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.780]   of security auditing and testing.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.780]   My own experience is that right now,
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.460]   it feels like we're at about a phase
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.300]   comparable to when we were doing
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.900]   the original Ethereum launch,
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.620]   when we were maybe about four months away from launch.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.580]   - So that's just a hunch, then you can-
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:46.620]   - That's just a hunch, yeah.
[01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:50.020]   - So how, you know, it took like over a decade
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.580]   for people to move from Python 2 to Python 3.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.580]   How do you see the move from like this phase zero
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.180]   for different consensus mechanism?
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:05.060]   Do you see there being a drastic phase shift
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.580]   in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism?
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.140]   - So in phase zero, I don't expect too many people
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.940]   to do much because in phase zero and phase one,
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.780]   the new chain, they get it deliberately
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.340]   and it doesn't have too much functionality turned on.
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.540]   It's there just like,
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:22.420]   if you want to be a proof of stake validator,
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.380]   you can get things started.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.900]   If you want to store data
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.340]   for other blockchain applications, you can get started.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.540]   But existing applications will largely
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.420]   keep living on each one.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.340]   And then when the merger happens,
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.100]   then the merger is a operation that happens all at once.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.900]   So that's kind of one of the benefits
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.100]   of a consensus system, that like on the one hand,
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.580]   you have to coordinate the upgrade,
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:49.100]   but on the other hand, the upgrade can be coordinated.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.220]   - So what's CasperFFG by the way?
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.220]   - CasperFFG is the consensus algorithm
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.820]   that we are using for the proof of stake.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.340]   - Is there something interesting,
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.420]   specific about CasperFFG,
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:03.820]   like some beautiful aspect of it that's-
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:04.660]   - There is.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:09.660]   So CasperFFG combines together kind of two different schools
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.740]   of a consensus algorithm design.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.500]   So the general two different schools
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.740]   of the design are, right?
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.860]   One is a 50% fault tolerant,
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:23.220]   but dependent on network synchrony.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.380]   So 50% fault tolerant,
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.820]   but it didn't tolerate up to 50% of faults, but not more,
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.300]   but it depends on an assumption
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.020]   that all of the nodes can talk to each other
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.580]   within some limited period of time.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.740]   Like if I send the message,
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.500]   you'll receive it within a few seconds.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.540]   And the second school is 33% fault tolerant,
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.280]   but safe under asynchrony,
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.380]   which means that if we agree on something,
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.940]   then that thing is finalized.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.300]   And even if the network goes horribly wonky
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.940]   the second after that thing is finalized,
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.740]   there's no way to revert that thing.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.820]   And-
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:03.100]   - That's fascinating how you would make that happen.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:06.300]   - It's definitely quite clever.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.900]   I'd recommend the CasperFFG paper.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.460]   If you just search like archive,
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.140]   as in like ARXIV and CasperFFG, it's right there.
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.340]   - That's an archive, the paper's an archive.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.340]   - Who are the authors?
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.900]   - Myself and Virgil Griffith.
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:20.740]   - That's awesome.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.460]   I take a small tangent.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.180]   This idea of just putting out white papers and papers
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.940]   and putting them on archive and just putting them publicly,
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:32.060]   is that at the core?
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.460]   Is that a necessary component of cryptocurrency?
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.940]   Is that the tradition started
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.780]   with Satoshi Nakamoto?
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.620]   What do you make of it?
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.540]   Like, what do you make of the future
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.900]   of that kind of sharing of ideas?
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.060]   - I guess so, yeah.
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.980]   And it's definitely something that's kind of mandatory
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:53.700]   for crypto because like crypto is all about making systems
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.220]   where you don't have to trust the operators
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.660]   to trust that the thing works.
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:01.260]   And so if anything behind our system works
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.660]   is closed sourced, then that kind of kills the point.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.780]   And so there is the kind of a sense
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.140]   in which the fundamental properties of the category
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.500]   of the thing we're trying to build
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.820]   just kind of forces openness,
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:17.060]   but also openness just has proven
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.060]   to be a really great way to collaborate.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.740]   And then there's actually a lot of innovation
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.780]   and academic collaboration that's just kind of happened
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.860]   ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.860]   So like, for example, we have this forum
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.620]   called ETH Research, that's like E-T-H-R-E-S-E-A-R
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.500]   and then dot C-H.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.900]   And there we publish kind of just ideas
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.940]   in a form that's kind of half formal,
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:45.460]   like it's halfway in between,
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.740]   like it's a kind of a text write up
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.220]   and you can have math in it,
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:52.620]   but it's often in a much shorter than a paper.
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:57.620]   And it turns out that the great majority of new ideas,
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.420]   like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.620]   that you can explain in like five to 10 lines
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.820]   and they don't really--
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.940]   - They don't need the whole formality of a paper.
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.540]   - Exactly, they don't require the kind of like 10 pages
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.100]   of any filler and so--
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.740]   - Introduction and conclusion is not needed.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:15.220]   - Yeah, and so instead you just kind of publish the idea
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.340]   and then people can go comment on it.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.180]   - That's brilliant.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.980]   - Yeah, this has been great for us.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.820]   - I think I interrupted you.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.900]   Was there something else on Casper FFG?
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.580]   - Yeah, so just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.100]   these two schools.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.820]   And so basically it creates this system
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.820]   where if you have more than 50% that are honest
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.660]   then and you have a network synchrony,
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.100]   then the thing kind of goes as a chain.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.660]   But then if network synchrony fails,
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.700]   then kind of the last few blocks in the chain
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.980]   might kind of get replaced.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.260]   But anything that was finalized
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.660]   by this kind of more asynchronous process
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.380]   can't be reverted.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.420]   And so you essentially get a kind of best of both worlds
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.300]   between those two models.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.100]   - Okay, so I know what I'm doing to them.
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.660]   I'm gonna be reading the Casper FFG paper.
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.460]   Apologize for the romanticized question,
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   but what to you are some or the most beautiful idea
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:19.020]   in the world of Ethereum?
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.140]   Just something surprising, something beautiful,
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.540]   something powerful.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.260]   - Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that money
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.020]   can just emerge out of a database
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.260]   if enough people believe in it,
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.300]   I think is definitely one of those things that's up there.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:37.260]   I think one of the things that I really love about Ethereum
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.620]   is also this concept of composability.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:42.540]   So this is the idea that if I build an application
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.860]   on top of Ethereum,
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.460]   then you can build an application
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.220]   that talks to my application
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.100]   and you don't even need my permission.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.580]   You don't even need to talk to me, right?
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.220]   So one really fun example of this is there was this
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.180]   kind of game on Ethereum called CryptoKitties
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.900]   that just involved kind of breeding digital cats.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:05.260]   And someone else created a game called CryptoDragons,
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.100]   where the way you play CryptoDragons is you have a dragon
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.100]   and you have to feed it CryptoKitties.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:15.620]   And they just created the whole thing
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.220]   just like as an Ethereum contract
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.340]   that you would send these tokens
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.100]   that are defined by this other Ethereum contract.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.060]   And for the interoperability to happen,
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.220]   like the projects don't really need to,
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.180]   like the teams don't really need to talk to each other.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.180]   You just kind of interface with the existing program.
[01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.700]   - So it's arbitrarily composable in this kind of way.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.420]   So you have different groups that could be working.
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:43.060]   So you could see it scaling to just
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.860]   outside of dragons and kitties,
[01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.660]   it could be, you could build like entire ecosystems
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.860]   of software in this kind of way.
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:53.860]   - Yeah, I mean, especially in the decentralized finance
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.220]   space that's been popping up in the last two years,
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.460]   there has been a huge amount of really interesting things
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.940]   happen as a result of this.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:04.260]   - Is it a particular kind of like financial applications
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.380]   kind of thing?
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.740]   - Yeah, I mean, there's like stable coins.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:12.740]   So this is a kind of tokens retain value equal to $1,
[01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:17.500]   but they're kind of backed by a cryptocurrency.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.100]   Then there's decentralized exchanges.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.740]   So, well, as far as decentralized exchanges goes,
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   there's this really interesting construction
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:31.140]   that has existed for about one and a half years now
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.580]   called Uniswap.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:35.340]   So what Uniswap is, it's a smart contract
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:38.860]   that holds the balances of two tokens.
[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.020]   We'll call them token A and token B.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.100]   And it maintains an invariance that the balance of token A
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.860]   multiplied by the balance of token B
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.660]   has to equal the same value.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.900]   And so the way that you trade against the thing
[01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.860]   is basically like you have this kind of curve,
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.940]   you know, like X times Y equals K.
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:58.460]   And before you trade, it's at some points on the curve.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:00.220]   After you trade, you just like pick some different,
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.300]   any other points on the curve.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.860]   And then whatever the delta X is,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.700]   that's the amount of A tokens you provide.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.780]   Whatever the delta Y is,
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.820]   that's the amount of B tokens you get or vice versa.
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.460]   And that's just, and then kind of the slope
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.180]   at the current points on the curve kind of is the price.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.820]   And so that just is the whole thing.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:24.820]   And that just allows you to have this exchange for tokens.
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:29.260]   And even if there's very few participants
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.620]   and the whole thing is just like so simple
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.500]   and it's just very easy to set up,
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.220]   very easy to participate in.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.140]   And it just provides so much value to people.
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.860]   - And the fundamental,
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:47.900]   the distributed application infrastructure
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.500]   allows that somehow.
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.340]   - Yes.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.340]   So this is a smart contract meeting.
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.700]   This is all a computer program
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.460]   that's just running on Ethereum.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.100]   - Smart contracts too are just fascinating.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.540]   - They are.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.380]   - Okay.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.060]   Do you think cryptocurrency may become the main currency
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.380]   in the world one day?
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.500]   So where do you think we're headed in terms of
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.820]   the role of currency,
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.820]   the structure type of currency in the world?
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   - I definitely expect fiat currencies to continue to exist
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.580]   and continue to be strong.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.780]   And I definitely expect kind of fiat currencies
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.460]   to also digitize in their own way
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.980]   over the next couple of decades.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.580]   - What's fiat currency by the way?
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:29.300]   - Oh, just like things like US dollars
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.060]   and like dollars and euros and yen and these other things.
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.940]   - And they're sort of backed by governments.
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:34.780]   - Yes.
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.900]   But I also expect sort of cryptocurrencies
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.740]   to play this sort of important role
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:44.140]   in just making sure that people always have an alternative
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.740]   if fiat currencies start breaking.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:50.580]   So like if, or if you're in, you know,
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.460]   some very high inflation place like Venezuela, for example,
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:59.460]   or if your country just kind of gets cut off from,
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:04.900]   cut off from other financial systems
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.140]   because of something the banks do,
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.300]   like if any kind of,
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.980]   if there's even like some major trade disruption
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:13.220]   or something worse happens,
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:16.700]   then like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.980]   that just because of their kind of global neutrality,
[01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.700]   they're just kind of always there
[01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.220]   and you can keep using them.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.220]   - It's interesting that you're quite humble
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.380]   about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.820]   You don't think there's a possible future
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.900]   where it becomes the main set of currency
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.820]   because it feels like fiat,
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.420]   it feels like the centralized control
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:42.660]   by governments of currency is limiting somehow,
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:46.100]   maybe my naive utopian view of the world.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.940]   - It's definitely very possible.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.380]   I mean, I think like for cryptocurrencies
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:58.380]   being the main form of value to kind of work well,
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:04.220]   like you do need to have some much more price stability
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:05.540]   than they have today.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.340]   And I mean, there are now stable coins
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.700]   and there are kind of cryptocurrencies
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.140]   that try to be more stable than existing things
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.100]   like Bitcoin and Ether,
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:18.100]   but that just is to me kind of the main challenge.
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.660]   - Do you think that's a characteristic
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.380]   of just being the early days?
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.980]   It's such a young concept.
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.420]   10 years is nothing in the history of money.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.860]   - Yeah, and I think it's a combination of two things, right?
[01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:35.340]   One is it's still early days,
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.180]   but the other is a kind of more durable
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.580]   and a kind of economic problem,
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:42.220]   which is that like demand for currency is volatile, right?
[01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:45.620]   Because of like recessions, booms,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.900]   changes to technology, lots of things,
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.860]   and if people's demand for how much currency
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.340]   they wanna hold changes.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:54.780]   And if you have a currency that has a fixed supply,
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:58.580]   then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.500]   as a change in value of the currency.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.780]   And so what that means is that kind of the volatility
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:06.780]   of demand becomes entirely translated into volatility
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.660]   and kind of prices of things that dominated
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.100]   in that currency.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.980]   But if you have a currency where instead
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.700]   the supply can change and so the supply can kind of go up
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.700]   when there's more demand,
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:20.460]   then you have the supply kind of absorbing
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.020]   more of that volatility and so the price of the currency
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.860]   would absorb less of the volatility.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:27.620]   - On that topic, so Bitcoin does have a limited supply,
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.740]   a specific fixed supply.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.580]   - Yes.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.820]   - What's the idea, and Ethereum doesn't,
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:38.540]   but can you clarify just in the comments you just made,
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.620]   is Ethereum qualify to the kind of currency
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:44.460]   that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply?
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.980]   - I mean, it's a bit more flexible,
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.540]   but kind of the thing that you would really want
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:53.540]   is something that's kind of specifically flexible
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.860]   in response to how valuable the currency is.
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:01.060]   And I'd recommend you look at stable coins as well.
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:04.780]   So like things like DAI, for example, it's like-
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:05.620]   - How do you spell that?
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.060]   - DAI.
[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:09.460]   - And what's stable coins?
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.020]   Is it a type of cryptocurrency?
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.900]   - It is a type of cryptocurrency.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:16.100]   It's a type of cryptocurrency that's issued
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:19.860]   by a smart contract, one of these Ethereum computer programs
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.700]   that where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.500]   and then it basically, like that people deposit
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.740]   and then it issues DAI and the reason why people deposit
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.740]   is because they want to kind of go high leverage
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:33.700]   on their ether.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.100]   And so it kind of pairs these two sets of users,
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.140]   one that wants stability and one that kind of wants
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.580]   extra risk together with each other.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.580]   And it basically creates some,
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:48.900]   or gives one set of participants a guarantee
[01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:51.900]   that they'll be paid, that they have this asset
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.620]   that can be later converted back into ether,
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.180]   but specifically at kind of the $1 rate.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.180]   - And it has some kind of a stabilizing network effects.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.660]   - Yeah, it has this.
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:06.020]   Yeah, it has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it.
[01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:06.860]   - That's fascinating.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:09.700]   Okay, this world is awesome technically,
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.700]   just from a scientific perspective, it's an awesome world
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.460]   that I often don't see from an outsider's perspective.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.500]   What I often see is kind of maybe hype
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:23.160]   and a little bit, if I may say so, like charlatanism.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.020]   And you don't often see, at least from my outsider's
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.980]   perspective, the beautiful science of it
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.860]   and the engineering of it.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:32.900]   Maybe, is there a comment you can make
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:39.220]   of who to follow, how to learn about this world
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:44.300]   without being interrupted by the charlatans
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.180]   and the hype people in this space?
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.740]   - I think you do need to just know the specific
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.820]   kind of just people to follow.
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:55.900]   Like there's all the kind of the cryptographers
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:59.260]   and the researchers, and there's just like,
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.340]   even just the Ethereum research crew,
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:04.260]   like myself, like Dan Kradt, Danny Justin,
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:09.260]   the other people, and then the academic cryptographers.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:14.500]   Before this today, I was at Stanford,
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.340]   and Stanford has the Center for Blockchain Research,
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.420]   and Dan Bonet, that's a really famous
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:24.580]   and great cryptographer, was running it.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.540]   And there's a lot of other people there,
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.780]   and there's people working on zero-knowledge proofs,
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:34.140]   for example, and Zuko from Zcash
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:38.100]   is one other person that I respect.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.900]   So I think if you follow the technical--
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.220]   - You just crawl along that--
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.060]   - Yeah, yeah, you just kind of crawl.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.220]   - Start with the Ethereum group,
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.700]   and then look at the academics, Dan Bonet and so on,
[01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.580]   and then just cautiously expand the network
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.540]   of people you follow.
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.780]   - Yeah, exactly, and like if someone seems
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:56.860]   too self-promotional, then just like remove 'em.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:01.100]   Is there books that are, there's these white papers,
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.380]   and we just discussed about ideas being condescend
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.900]   to really small parts.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:09.180]   Is there books that are emerging that are kind of
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.820]   good introductory material for cryptographers?
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.580]   - So for historical ones,
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.900]   there's like Nathaniel Popper's "Digital Gold,"
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.220]   which is just about the history of Bitcoin.
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.900]   There's one, I think Matthew Leising announced
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.660]   that there's one about the history of Ethereum.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.500]   For technical ones, there's Andrea Santanopoulos'
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.980]   "Mastering Ethereum."
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:32.100]   - Great, so let me ask you sort of,
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:37.100]   sorry, to pull back to the idea of governments
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.540]   and decentralized currency.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:44.180]   You know, there's a tension between decentralization
[01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.940]   of currency and the power of nations,
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.220]   the power of governments.
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.220]   What's your sense about that tension?
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:56.100]   Is there some rule for regulation of currency?
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:59.260]   You've, yeah, is there, like,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:02.940]   is the government the enemy of digital currency,
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.220]   of distributed currency,
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.860]   or can they be like cautious friends?
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:11.780]   - I mean, I think like,
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.940]   the one thing that people forget is that
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:16.620]   it's clearly not entirely an enemy,
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:21.620]   because I think if there hadn't been
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.460]   so much government regulation on
[01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:25.900]   a kind of centralized,
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:28.980]   issuing centralized digital currencies,
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:31.740]   then we'd be seeing things,
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.380]   people like Google and Facebook and Twitter
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.140]   just kind of issuing them left and right.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.340]   And then, like, if that was the case,
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.260]   then decentralized currencies would still appeal
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.180]   to some people, but they definitely would appeal
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.740]   to less people than today.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.820]   So even in that sense, I think it's
[01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.740]   clearly been more of a,
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.340]   just kind of set the stage for the existence
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:56.140]   of the sector in some ways.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:01.140]   But also, and I think some of both,
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:03.820]   there's definitely things that governments
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:06.740]   can do, in some cases, have done to
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.460]   hurt the spread of, and of growth of blockchains.
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.380]   There's things that they've done to help,
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:18.100]   and they've, in some cases, definitely done a good job
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.060]   of going after fraudulent projects,
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:24.060]   going after some of the projects that have
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.060]   some of the kind of craziest and most misleading marketing.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:31.580]   There's also the possibility that governments
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:35.500]   will end up using blockchains for a lot of different things.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.500]   Governments, yeah, they do a lot more
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.820]   than just regulating, right?
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.300]   There's also, they have the kind of
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:49.860]   identity records, and they have property registries,
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:53.700]   even their own currency is secured,
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:57.100]   lots of different kind of things that they're operating.
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.780]   And there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:03.740]   - Yeah, and they can leverage technology
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:06.100]   to do a lot of good for our societies.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:09.140]   It is a little unfortunate that governments
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.180]   often lag behind in terms of their acceptance
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.420]   and leverage of technology.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.380]   If you look at the autonomous vehicle space,
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.980]   AI in general, they're a few years behind.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:24.100]   It'd be nice to help them catch up.
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.820]   That's an always ongoing problem.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:31.500]   You met Vladimir Putin to discuss
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.300]   the centralized currency here.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.620]   You're born in, where were you born?
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:39.700]   - Kolomna, it's a city about 115 kilometers south of Moscow.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:40.980]   - In Russia? - Yes.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.540]   - Yeah, I grew up in Moscow.
[01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:48.020]   I mean, Vladimir Putin is a central figure
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.060]   in this part of the world.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:52.300]   So what was that like meeting him?
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.900]   What was that experience like?
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.020]   - He's taller in photos than in person.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:01.220]   - Yeah, he's, yeah, that's right.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.020]   He's five seven, I think, five eight, maybe.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.180]   - Yeah, and that's, unfortunately,
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.700]   we didn't actually kind of have too much of a chance
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.540]   to talk to him.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.740]   Like I managed to see him for about one minute
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.620]   at the end of this meeting.
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.980]   And I did get a chance to see a lot,
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.100]   some of the other end of government ministers
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.940]   and he recommended some.
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:25.420]   And some of them are actually interested
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.820]   in trying to use blockchains to,
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.900]   like for various government use cases,
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.020]   they're gonna have a little bit of corruption
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:33.980]   and other things.
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:37.580]   And I have, it's hard to tell from one conversation
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.540]   kind of what things are genuine
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.580]   and what things are just like, oh, blockchain is cool,
[01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:42.700]   let's do blockchain.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:47.700]   - Right, but when I listened to like Barack Obama
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.620]   talk about artificial intelligence,
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:54.060]   there's certain things I hear where,
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.340]   okay, so he might not be an expert in AI,
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:00.460]   but he actually studied it carefully enough
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.420]   to think about it.
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:06.540]   Even if it's just reading a Wikipedia page,
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.380]   like he really thought about what this technology means.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:13.860]   Did you get a sense that Putin or some of the ministers
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.740]   like thought about blockchain,
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:17.620]   like thought about the fundamentals of technology,
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:19.780]   or like understand it intuitively,
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:23.340]   or are they too old school to try to grasp it?
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.860]   - Some are old school, some are more new school.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.820]   It depends, it's definitely,
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:30.660]   it depends on who you talk to.
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:33.020]   - I mean, that's an open question for me with Putin
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:34.900]   because Putin has said some stuff about AI.
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:36.020]   - I don't know, as I said,
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.140]   I've only talked to him for about one minute, so.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:41.940]   - But sometimes you can pick up sort of insights.
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.460]   As a quick comment, they're about,
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.820]   maybe you can correct me on this,
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.180]   but they're about 3,000 cryptocurrencies
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:49.900]   being actively traded.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.980]   - Yes.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.540]   - And Ethereum is one of,
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.580]   you know, a lot of people believe
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.140]   that Ethereum will be the main cryptocurrency.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:58.660]   I think Bitcoin is currently still the main cryptocurrency,
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.420]   but Ethereum very likely might become the main one.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:07.180]   Is this kind of diversity good in the crypto world?
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:08.940]   Do you see it sticking around?
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.660]   Should there be a winner?
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:12.980]   Like, should there be some consensus globally
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:16.060]   around Bitcoin or around Ethereum?
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:17.740]   Like, what's your sense?
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:19.460]   - I definitely think the diversity is good.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.380]   And I definitely think also
[01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.540]   that there's probably too many people
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.900]   trying to make separate blockchains right now.
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.900]   The number should definitely be greater than one
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:31.780]   and probably greater than two or even five.
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:33.180]   - Not 3,000.
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.740]   - Not 3,000, yeah.
[01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:37.860]   And also not even like 40 high quality platforms
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:39.420]   that try to do the same thing.
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.300]   And there's definitely this range
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:46.300]   from just like one person who just like wrongly thinks
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.500]   that you can create a cryptocurrency in like 12 hours
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.860]   and doesn't even think about kind of the community aspects
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.780]   of maintaining it,
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:58.020]   going to people actually trying
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.780]   but only creating a really tiny one,
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.420]   to like scammers,
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.700]   to people like making something
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:06.140]   that's actually successful.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:10.860]   And then there's a lot of different categories of blockchain
[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.980]   and of project in terms of what it's trying to do
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.660]   and what applications it's for.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:18.900]   And I think the experimentation is definitely healthy.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.700]   - If you look at the two worlds,
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.100]   it might be a little bit disjoints,
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:27.060]   but the distributed applications, cryptocurrency,
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.380]   and then the world of artificial intelligence.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:33.020]   Do you see there's some overlap between these worlds
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.860]   that both worry about centralized control?
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.220]   Is there some overlap that's interesting
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:40.700]   that you think about, do you think about AI much?
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:44.620]   - Yeah, and I think definitely I would have thought
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:48.340]   about things like the AI head of control problems
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.620]   and a lot of the problems and all of those things.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:53.260]   - Do you worry about the existential threat of AI?
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:55.820]   - That's definitely one of the things I worry about.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:01.940]   I think block, there's a lot of kind of common challenges
[01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.980]   because in both cases, what you're ultimately trying to do
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:09.660]   is you're trying to kind of get a simple system
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.820]   to direct a more complex system.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.220]   Like in the case of this strong AI,
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.660]   the idea would be that the simple system is people
[01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:21.380]   and the complex system is, well, whatever thing
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:24.780]   the people end up kind of unleashing on the universe
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.140]   that'll hopefully be a great thing.
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:30.380]   And in the case of blockchains,
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.420]   kind of the complex, well, the simple thing is
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:35.180]   the algorithm, which is a piece of static
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.460]   and fully open source code.
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:40.660]   And the more complex thing is just all
[01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:43.300]   of the different possible kind of human actors
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.460]   and of the strategies that they might end up use
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.020]   to participate in the network.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:51.140]   - Do you think about your own mortality?
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:54.580]   Like what you hope to accomplish in your life?
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.500]   - Oh, I definitely think about ending my own mortality.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.780]   - So that's, if I gave you the option to live forever,
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:02.820]   would you?
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:05.100]   - Depends a lot on what the fine birds is.
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:08.020]   But I mean, if it's one of those things
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:10.700]   where I'm gonna be kind of like floating through empty space
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.260]   for 10 to the 75 years, then no.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:17.620]   If it's a forever worth of,
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:21.060]   and of having a fulfilling life
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:26.060]   with friends to spend the time with,
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.580]   with kind of meaningful challenges to explore
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.860]   and interesting things to be working on,
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.540]   then I think absolutely move.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:38.940]   - That's a beautifully put.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.780]   Live forever, but you'd have to check the fine print.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.500]   I think there's no better way to end it.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.180]   Vitalik, thank you so much for talking to us.
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:51.140]   So exciting to follow your work from a distance.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.460]   And thank you for creating a revolutionary idea
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.460]   and sticking with it and building it out
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.020]   and doing some incredible engineering work.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.300]   And thanks for talking today.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.820]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:02.460]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:03.820]   with Vitalik Buterin.

[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.940]   from Vitalik Buterin.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:40.180]   The thing that I often ask startups on top of Ethereum is,
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:43.300]   can you please tell me why using Ethereum blockchain
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.540]   is better than using Excel?
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:47.620]   And if they can come up with a good answer,
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:51.540]   that's when you know you got something really interesting.
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:55.060]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
