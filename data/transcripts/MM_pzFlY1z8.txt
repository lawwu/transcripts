[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.260]   So you buy that vast shift in the foundations of order of the universe,
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.860]   that instead of the world of things that make copies of themselves
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.500]   imperfectly, we are in the world of things that are designed and were designed.
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.660]   You buy that vast cosmological shift I was just describing,
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.360]   the utter disruption of everything you see that you call normal
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.560]   down to the leaves and the trees around you.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   You believe that.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.560]   Well, the same skepticism you're so fond of that argues against the rapture,
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.160]   can also be used to disprove this thing you believe that you think is
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.440]   probably pretty obvious, actually, now that I've pointed it out.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.500]   OK, your skepticism, your skepticism disproves too much, my friend.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.540]   That's actually a really good point.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.940]   It still leaves open the possibility of life, how it happens
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.140]   and when it happens, blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.600]   But actually, that's that's a good point.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600]   OK, so a second, second thing.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.940]   I'm not you set them up, I'll knock them down one after the other.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180]   (laughing)
