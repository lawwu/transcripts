[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   (upbeat hip hop music)
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.520]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.660]   I'm here with Josh Kronke, fellow Columbia, Missourian.
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.520]   I appreciate you on the podcast, man.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.360]   - Absolutely, man.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.920]   - I know you don't do a lot of media, so I appreciate it.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.540]   - No, man, it's my pleasure to be here,
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.640]   especially like, as you said,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.060]   with a fellow Columbia, Missourian.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.900]   - Yes, sir.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.080]   - We're a rare breed up here.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.640]   - We are a rare breed, yeah.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.560]   I wanna start off a little bit with your childhood
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.020]   because I find it interesting.
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.200]   You know, growing up,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.240]   your father was obviously already very wealthy.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.720]   I don't know if it was to the point that it is now,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.280]   but like you, just being around you
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.880]   and how down to earth you are,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.000]   I find that intriguing just in the way you came up.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   So talk a little bit about, you know, growing up,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.260]   regular things like high school and things like that.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.280]   Talk about your childhood.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.960]   - Well, yeah, I mean, and you know,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.600]   as we affectionately say back home, Como, very well.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.320]   And I was born and raised in Central Missouri,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.760]   Columbia to be exact.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.020]   And yeah, I mean, I do come from a background
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.600]   where I've been financially secure,
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.200]   very secure my entire life.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.160]   But, you know, my parents,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.600]   I think they did an unbelievable job
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.720]   of raising both my older sister and I
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.360]   to understand that, you know,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.640]   to feel blessed in the position that we're in,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.200]   but don't let it define you in any way.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.120]   We're all humans
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.520]   and we're all kind of going through this experience
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.840]   in our own kind of different versions
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.200]   of how we're experiencing life.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.760]   And, but being from Columbia, I think is a,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760]   it's a college town.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.640]   There's a lot of really good people in there.
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.960]   And, you know, the sport of basketball really is the thing
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.080]   that really kind of kept me grounded, you know,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.480]   going through junior high and high school
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.200]   and then playing in Mizzou.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.680]   You know, you experience people from all walks of life.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   And so some of my best friends from a very early age,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.280]   I understood didn't come from as fortunate
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.320]   of a background as myself,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.040]   from a two-parent home, from a financially secure home.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.240]   And so I understand, or I understood at an early age
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.640]   how fortunate I was.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.840]   And my parents didn't ever let me forget that.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.960]   - Yeah.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720]   Yeah, I find, I think about it all the time,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.480]   like even raising kids of my own one day,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.080]   like people always talk about once you make money,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.800]   you want to make money for your kids, kids,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.640]   and all these things.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.480]   But when you really think about it,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.040]   I think about like, would I be here today
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.920]   if I had parents who were very stable?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240]   One of the things that pushed me to even be successful
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.680]   is the fact that I had, you know, my family,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   I have seven siblings, my mom was a stay-at-home mom,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.320]   you know, I wanted to make it so that they could be okay.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.360]   So I just find that interesting
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.280]   when people just stay super down to earth,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.960]   regardless of their circumstances.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.480]   - Yeah, and for me, there was also a motivation to,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320]   with the basketball part, to kind of forge my own identity.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.440]   - Right.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   - You know, being in Columbia, and it is a college town,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.520]   but it's a small town in certain ways.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.840]   And so, you know, being around sports,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.200]   I realized that I could forge my own identity
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.000]   in the shadow of kind of my father, my grandfather,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.800]   my parents, and all the success that they've had.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   And so sports was a big impact on me.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.520]   - Do you feel like you had to become at an early age,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.240]   like a very good judge of character,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.280]   even like just with friends that you would hang around,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400]   but you know, when it comes to dating or girls,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.880]   like, is that something you felt
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   like you had to develop pretty early on?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.160]   - Yeah, you know, I don't think I'm the sharpest tool
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   in the shed when it comes to certain things,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.000]   but you know, I think my EQ and reading people,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   I'm fairly decent at it.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.520]   You know, I remember being in like fourth grade,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320]   and I just moved into a new house.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.960]   And I remember overhearing someone in the lunch line
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   saying they wanted to become my friend
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.880]   so they could come see my house, my parents' house.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.920]   And so when you're that little, it's interesting,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.000]   'cause it kind of takes you back
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.960]   because it's not anything
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   that you've ever really thought about,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.800]   but it does, you know, put your guard up in certain ways.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.960]   And so, you know, I've had to do a lot of personal work
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   on trust and understanding that, you know,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.240]   not everybody's out to get you.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.160]   Not everybody's guilty until proven innocent, you know.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.000]   But when it comes to relationships with other people,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.400]   and especially relationships with women,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   I did have to, you know, overcome some certain fears
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.280]   in myself because there are good people in this world,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   not everybody's out to get you.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.940]   And so reading that and understanding that,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.340]   giving people the benefit of the doubt,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.080]   but also being slightly guarded, you know,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.000]   that was definitely something I had to develop over time,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.640]   but very early on.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.360]   - Yeah, it's a hurdle, I think, even, you know,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.680]   that I go through.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.520]   - Yeah.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.820]   - And I've noticed, you know, even like being around you
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.720]   at the Super Bowl, which was amazing,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.920]   you're still around a lot of the same people
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   that you kind of grew up with,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.000]   like hearing them talk and talk about you and stuff
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.200]   and how proud they were of you.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.420]   And their stories were always like,
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.240]   "I've known Josh forever."
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.200]   So I think it's cool that you kind of stay around
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.040]   the same people that you grew up with.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.720]   - Yeah, you know, we've, and I've still got a few buddies
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.980]   that I grew up playing basketball with.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.640]   Kareem, I think was at, Kareem Rush was at the game.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.160]   But yeah, I mean, you know, I think, you know,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.400]   as life evolves, and I have friends that I've just made
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.280]   within the last few years
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.640]   that have become good friends of mine.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.280]   But I do have a core group of guys
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.600]   and a group of friends from back home.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.860]   Definitely from Mizzou, a couple of guys from Kansas City
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.000]   and guys that I just kind of was grew up around
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.480]   from late teens to early 20s
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.880]   and a lot of formative years in there.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.960]   And I think it's important to, you know,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   stay in touch with people, understand that people grow
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.840]   and they sometimes they grow apart,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.680]   but you always have a little bit of a bond
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.920]   and check in with people
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.600]   because you never know what people are going through.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   - A hundred percent.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.260]   - Yeah.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.880]   - And basketball was a big part of your childhood.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.080]   Talk about, you know, going to Mizzou,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.440]   were you nice?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.160]   Were you like, were you, you actually got buckets?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.000]   Were you nice?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.840]   How was that?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.000]   - Well, I definitely wasn't getting buckets like you,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.040]   trust me on that one.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.920]   But yeah, I mean, I was like a top 50,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.680]   top 75 recruit in high school.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.400]   Went to Rockbridge in Columbia
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.520]   and actually my senior year, I hurt my knee.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.600]   I didn't tear my ACL, but I had my left kneecap
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.400]   with sublux and kind of come out of the alignment.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.320]   And so I had to have it scoped
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.040]   and I came back way too soon
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.840]   because I really wanted to play, it was my senior year.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.240]   And so, but I could tell that I wasn't right.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.960]   And so after the season was over,
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   I took a little time and thought about it.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.560]   And I did, I did decided to do a fifth year
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.680]   and went to prep school.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   - Okay.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.560]   - I was, I didn't turn 18 until right when I graduated.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.760]   So I was kind of a little bit young for my grade,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.200]   even though it was still the correct,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.480]   correct position for me to be in.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.440]   And so I did a post-grad year in New Hampshire
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.160]   where I got stronger, got my knee healthy again
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   and really got my bounce back
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.400]   and then came back to play at Mizzou in the fall of '99.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720]   And that was when there was a change in coaching.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   And we went, Quinn Snyder was hired.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.520]   And so yeah, Quinn, he was, and he's still coaching
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.760]   and having a great career coaching in the NBA today.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.720]   And he, I learned so much from being around him
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.440]   and around the program.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.880]   We had some, we had a little bit of success
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.400]   and I started the first half of my junior and senior years
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.640]   but there was always, you know,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   more talented guys behind me.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.520]   - Who was on that team, I'm trying to think.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.320]   - My junior year, excuse me, my red shirt sophomore year,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.240]   we made the Elite Eight, we lost to Oklahoma.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.000]   That was as far as we made in the tournament.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   I thought we were gonna beat them,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.720]   but they had a really good team, Hollis Price.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.120]   And then, but on our squad, that was Kareem Rush,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.160]   Clarence Gilbert, Arthur Johnson, Ricky Paulding.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.560]   And then my later years, my junior year,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.120]   I started half the year and then got beat out,
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.440]   rightfully so, by a guy named Jimmy McKinney
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.320]   from St. Louis, great player.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.480]   And then my senior year,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.200]   we had another young two guard named Thomas Gardner,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   played in the pros for a year or two.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.840]   But by the end of my senior year,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.960]   my knees were really hurting.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.320]   I had another surgery on my right knee.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.040]   And so I was just kind of,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.120]   I was in a state of flux where I loved the game.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.360]   But, you know, being so committed at the collegiate level,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.400]   I didn't have the opportunity to really do a lot
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.720]   in the summer times, like from a professional standpoint
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.440]   and thinking about the rest of life.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.280]   And so I had a couple offers to play in Europe,
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   but I passed them up and got into the real world,
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.480]   so to speak.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.400]   And it's been fun.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.160]   I did an internship right out of school
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.760]   with the NBA league office.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.620]   And that was eye-opening on a lot of levels
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.560]   because it shows you how the league operates
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.040]   and how big of a business it really is.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.140]   You know, when you're at the league level,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.760]   you're not dealing at the team level.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.080]   It's all business all the time.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.160]   It was also very humbling
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.800]   because I was in the player programs department
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.240]   and under Chris Achin, who I'm sure you know as well.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.360]   She was at the league at the time,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.720]   and Chris is a wonderful, wonderful person.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.280]   And she taught me a lot while I was there.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   And she was, our group was in charge
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.360]   of the rookie transition program.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.200]   - Okay, yeah. - And so.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.720]   - Yeah, out in New York, right?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.040]   - Yep, yep.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.160]   And so the rookie transition program kind of is,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.540]   you know, for those that might not be familiar with it,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.200]   is a, you know, kind of a crash course
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.220]   in how to be an adult.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.540]   That's just, you know, for better or worse.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.580]   And I went from competing against all those guys
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.300]   about three months prior.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.140]   - Yeah.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.000]   - And then now I was the one making copies
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   and making sure everybody was on time.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.500]   And I would see these guys and have to say hello,
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.340]   and they knew who I was
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.540]   'cause we competed against each other,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.660]   but I was completely on the other side of it.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.500]   - Yeah.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.100]   - And so that was, it was very humbling right away.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.940]   But you could see, you know, the growth
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.420]   that really took place in myself
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.060]   over those few years in New York.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.720]   I did the internship for about six months.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.580]   Then I was unemployed for two months in New York,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.700]   which was probably the most fun two months of my life.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.460]   (laughing)
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.300]   - Unemployed.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.120]   - Yeah.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.380]   (laughing)
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.820]   But then after that, I worked for an investment bank
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.780]   called Lehman Brothers.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.980]   They're no longer a firm anymore.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   They went under during the crash of late 2007, '08, '09.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.860]   And it was a great experience.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.900]   I learned how to, you know, look at certain deals
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.980]   from a financial perspective.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.960]   Really taught me how to value,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.600]   or the backbone of kind of our family business
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.660]   outside of sports is real estate, commercial real estate.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.460]   And so I was a commercial real estate underwriter
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.580]   in their finance group for a few years.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.700]   And I learned so much, but I think it's,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.140]   as much as it's important to learn what you love to do,
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.660]   it's also important what you love not to do.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.420]   And so I knew that I really wanted to be more involved.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.340]   If I was ever gonna be involved in sports,
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.700]   be more involved at the team level.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.300]   Thought I would find that much more rewarding.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.280]   And from a family business overall perspective,
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.980]   I really learned how to look at a deal from,
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.800]   a real estate deal from the other side of it,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.640]   from the financial banking side,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.060]   as opposed to the development side.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.980]   And I think that's helped me to this day,
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.440]   helped me understand kind of things
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.220]   that we're doing across our venues.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.100]   You know, when you're trying to redevelop something
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.300]   in or around our venues, our arenas with our teams,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.580]   and then our shopping centers
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.820]   that we have around the country as well.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.600]   So it was a great experience.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.220]   I moved to Denver in 2007.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.740]   Started watching tape with the Nuggets coaches
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.180]   and never looked back.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.700]   - Real quick, did you hear what happened to me
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.740]   at the rookie transition camp in New York?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.340]   - Was this the one where you posted Adam Silver's number?
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.160]   - Yeah.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.000]   (laughing)
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.060]   So, I mean, I didn't know that you knew
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.340]   what rookie transition camp was, man.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.640]   We're sitting there like, you know, in the classroom,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.120]   learning about something,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.660]   and they have this slide show or whatever.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.220]   And I just take a picture of the room
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.780]   on Snapchat or whatever.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.620]   But like, his number is posted on the screen.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.460]   - On the screen.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.300]   (laughing)
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.140]   - And like, I didn't even realize I posted it,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.060]   but I look on my Snapchat 10 minutes later,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.580]   and my sister replied to it and was like,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.660]   "You know you just put Adam Silver's number out there."
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.060]   So I look at the post and it already had
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.180]   like a thousand screenshots.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.020]   (laughing)
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.380]   And then like, literally like 10 minutes later,
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.740]   they put it out on, they put it on the screen
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.640]   in the classroom, and they were like,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.300]   "Basically, I thought I was gonna get kicked out the league."
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.120]   - Oh, wow.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.960]   - It was like a big deal.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.340]   And like, I ended up having to get up on stage
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.820]   and apologize in front of everybody.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.540]   They were like, the way they worded it though,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.660]   they were like, "Yeah, someone in this room
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.360]   "leaked Adam Silver's number.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.020]   "They're gonna come up here and apologize."
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.700]   So everyone around the class is looking around,
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.840]   and I have to stand up, get up on the stage,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.680]   and apologize.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.500]   - Did they tell you in advance
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.340]   they were gonna have you do it?
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.260]   - Like, they brought me in the back room
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.780]   with like Adam Silver's, and they were like,
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.620]   "What were you doing?"
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.380]   I was like, "It was an honest accident, I'm sorry.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.580]   "I can get up on stage and apologize if you guys want to."
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.820]   They were like, "Yeah, we're gonna have you do that."
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.340]   So it was like a whole situation,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.280]   but that's funny that you were out in New York
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.360]   for a few years.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.620]   - It was good, it was a good time.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.620]   And I did see that, but.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.420]   - It was crazy.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.340]   But yeah, so you go through college,
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.140]   you go through that internship and everything like that,
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.260]   and then you realize you want to be a part
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.660]   of the business world.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.080]   When did you and your father and your family in general
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.780]   decide you wanted to start owning teams?
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:12.060]   - For my father, it goes back to kind of a dream
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.820]   that he's had for a very long time.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.420]   I think that, and he's a huge sports fan in general,
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.680]   I think my family, we love sports.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.120]   I was always taught to kind of,
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.660]   both by my dad and my mom,
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.540]   use sports as a metaphor for life.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   There's teamwork, sacrifice, understanding
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.960]   how you can help others.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.460]   And so for me, I guess, I'm rambling a little bit,
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.060]   what was your original question?
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.100]   'Cause I was gonna go down one way,
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.940]   I don't want to make sure I answered the question.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.340]   - No, I mean, yeah, we're just talking a little bit more,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.740]   just like, how did you get into that?
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.080]   - Yeah, so like, it was my dad's dream kind of way back when
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.480]   and I guess I would say that as a real estate developer,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.720]   he was always looking for a potential deal.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   And the first deal that ever kind of came around
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   was when the NFL was expanding in 1993, '94 maybe, '92.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.440]   And that was, the NFL was expanding
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.520]   and they were gonna award two new teams to two cities.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.880]   And so St. Louis wanted to be on the ticket
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.720]   and my dad partnered with some guys locally,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.520]   they reached out to him and unfortunately,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.000]   it didn't result in an expansion franchise.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.180]   But when that didn't work out,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.520]   he helped position another group of people
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.800]   to come to St. Louis and that resulted in the Rams moving.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   And then from there, it became a really,
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.420]   just a minority investment in an NFL team
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.560]   that morphed into, he was looking around for,
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.040]   like I said, as a real estate developer,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.620]   potentially a deal that involved a stadium venue
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.000]   and teams as well.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.800]   And he looked around, I think there was a few opportunities
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.360]   and then all of a sudden, the Denver deal presented itself.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.100]   And so when you have a real estate developer
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.760]   that can make sense of a real estate deal
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.800]   that involves two sports teams,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.640]   that was kind of how we, what I say is,
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.320]   we were a real estate family that kind of fell into sports
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.160]   due to our love with it,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.940]   because that was the Avalanche Nuggets
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.820]   and at the time was called Pepsi Center,
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.980]   which is now Ball Arena.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:20.900]   - Right.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.660]   - And then that has morphed into what we have now,
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.740]   which is SoFi Stadium and the LA Rams.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.200]   We have Ball Arena, the teams in Avalanche Nuggets
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.180]   and also the Colorado Mammoth.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.420]   We have Dick's Sporting Goods Park,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.660]   which is where Colorado Rapids play in Denver.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.780]   And then the other one, which is the really big one,
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.700]   is over in London.
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.560]   We have Arsenal Football Club.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.400]   - Got you.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.220]   - Yeah.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.160]   - As a team owner and it's been a long time coming
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.280]   and there's been a lot of recent success of your teams,
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.440]   championships with us, the Avs, the Rams,
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.720]   which has to make you guys,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.080]   definitely in the most recent years,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.640]   like some of the most successful team owners in the history,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   but during that long process of developing the teams,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   drafting players,
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.000]   was there ever thought of letting some of these things go
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.300]   or you guys have been committed from the jump
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.380]   with all these teams?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.400]   - We've been pretty committed.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.200]   We're long-term holders in really everything that we do.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.700]   My father's philosophy,
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.820]   and I know that's one I'll carry forward with me as well,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.860]   is whenever you invest in something,
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.940]   if you're looking to make a short buck on it
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.140]   or try to figure out a way to make an exit somewhere,
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.460]   that's usually not our strategy.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.980]   I know there's some brilliant people out there
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.460]   that can make sense of deals like that,
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.580]   but we want to invest in something
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.380]   that makes sense for us over the long term.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.220]   - Got you.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.340]   - So when he did the Denver deal in 2000,
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.420]   I was still in school.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.100]   I was at Mizzou.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.220]   I remember him telling me about it
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.280]   and me just being incredibly excited,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.820]   but then they set out
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.060]   and they built kind of the first version of the Nuggets
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.940]   underneath kind of our family,
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.100]   and that resulted in some really amazing teams.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.860]   They hadn't made the playoffs in I don't know how long,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.220]   but they kind of stripped the roster down
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.060]   over the first year,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.020]   drafted Carmelo Anthony in the summer of 2003,
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.420]   and then they started signing free agents,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.500]   and by the spring of 2004,
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.380]   they were in the playoffs,
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.120]   I think for nine or 10 straight years,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.020]   and that was a level of success
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.420]   that the Nuggets hadn't quite had,
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.100]   and then when my dad and I kind of really sat down
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.860]   to talk about the future
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.320]   of how we could build the Nuggets back,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.100]   I knew that I had some philosophy.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.100]   I'd been around the team for probably four or five years
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.460]   at that point in time,
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.700]   and I'd watched a lot of basketball
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.900]   and kind of tried to devise some sort of strategy.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.100]   I was like, you know what?
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.700]   It's never been done in Denver.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.980]   We've never won the whole thing.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.460]   How can we actually do this?
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.360]   And for me, the only advantage that we could really create
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.820]   was to kind of elongate our timeline,
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.800]   and so draft really good players
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.980]   that are also really good people,
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.100]   surround them with really good coaching,
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.220]   and try to grow something organically over time,
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.620]   and it's never gonna be perfect.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.380]   Progress is never linear, as you know.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.340]   I mean, our squad was up and down those first few years.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.460]   You guys were all kind of learning different things,
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.980]   the different roles,
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.480]   and now, all of a sudden, you see it start to gel,
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.580]   and then you guys get hit with injuries,
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.720]   and so it required a certain amount of patience,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.220]   but also knowing that at the end of the day,
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.900]   we had really good people,
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.660]   and that's why we're really proud of you guys as players,
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.380]   but I think the group of people that we have down there
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.060]   is really unique around the NBA
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.300]   and how you guys all play for each other.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.060]   Our culture has kind of evolved to a place
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.980]   where I couldn't be prouder of it,
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.820]   and then the icing on the cake
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.780]   was to finally win the championship last year,
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.660]   but it all started kind of watching,
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.980]   we had a 57-win team in 2012, 2013,
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.100]   and we won 57 games and didn't have an All-Star,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.300]   and that's pretty hard to do in the NBA,
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.900]   but I would watch that team,
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.060]   and I remember watching us down in Miami,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.060]   and we played the Heat toe-to-toe for about 46 minutes,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.980]   and then they could go to a level
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.580]   and close those games out that we just didn't quite have,
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.140]   and so I was like, okay,
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.020]   if we're gonna take this step backwards
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.560]   and we're gonna finally come back to the playoffs one day,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.700]   we're gonna come back with a team
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.540]   that's built to be sustainable,
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:38.540]   and continually grow our ceiling organically,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.820]   and that's what you guys did, man.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.700]   You guys all worked your butts off.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.820]   You guys all figured out how to come together.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.240]   I remember I wasn't in the bubble,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.260]   but watching you guys kind of,
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.300]   I think in the bubble,
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.880]   there was a new level of confidence that was reached.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.300]   I saw you stepping up in new ways,
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.900]   Yoke and Jamal doing their thing,
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.580]   and it really kind of was a,
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.220]   I was watching on television going,
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.100]   this group can really do something special.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.460]   Yeah, and so that was the first time
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.820]   where I really was like, okay,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.380]   now how can we start to go for this,
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.780]   and then the patients that I talked about,
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.560]   we come out of the bubble,
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.680]   we kind of hit the ground running,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.780]   but we had lost Jeremy in free agency,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.780]   and it took a little while for us to figure out
[00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.500]   how we wanted to try to fill that void,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.140]   and then when Aaron came along,
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.180]   we jumped at that opportunity to get A.G. in the squad,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.100]   and then I think we ran off like,
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.540]   I don't know what we were those 10 games
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.620]   after we traded for Aaron,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.140]   but we were like, nine and one or something like that.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.060]   - It was before Jamal got hurt,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.860]   and it was like, I don't think we lost the game.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.020]   - Yeah, we were something like that.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.180]   We were eight and two, nine and one,
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.620]   but we were beating good teams
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.260]   and beating them pretty handily,
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.900]   and then Jamal went down,
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.180]   and I think that while we knew it internally at the time,
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.380]   maybe the rest of the league didn't,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.500]   we couldn't replace Jamal with anybody.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.340]   There was a level of skill and a level of chemistry
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.240]   that we knew we just had to sit tight,
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.500]   and then the following fall,
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.180]   you had to go through another adventure again,
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.180]   and it's amazing to think how far the group has come
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.960]   and how far certain individuals have come, man,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.660]   and I'm sure you look back on things at different times,
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.180]   and it's amazing to think how far we've come
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.500]   and how far we can still go.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.060]   - Yeah, no, that's crazy.
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.740]   Yeah, I saw some post or whatever.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.020]   It was talking about the individual stories
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.100]   of all the guys on our team
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.100]   and how it really was grown organically.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   When did you realize we had something special with Nikola?
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.740]   Did you know that early on?
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.060]   I know Nerkich was here at the time.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.620]   - Yeah, yeah, it's a funny story about Nikola,
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.160]   and if anybody tells you they knew,
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.300]   they are lying through their teeth.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.140]   - I didn't know.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.540]   The first year I got drafted,
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.300]   I went to training camp, and I had no idea,
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.020]   just 'cause he treats a game different than practice,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.380]   so I'm seeing Mason Plumlee and Nikola go at it.
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.620]   I'm like, wait, why does Nikola start over Mason?
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.140]   I remember that was my thought process.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.580]   So, yeah, tell me that story.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.420]   How did you--
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.340]   - So, yeah, Yoke is a funny story.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.060]   I remember sitting with our former president
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.580]   of basketball ops and GM at the time,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.420]   Tim Connolly and Arturis Karnaschovas.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.820]   One of 'em now runs the Timberwolves,
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.620]   and one of 'em now runs the Chicago Bulls.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.900]   But they were in our front office at the time,
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.940]   and they're like, hey, there's this guy
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.580]   that you should see on tape,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.500]   'cause we want him to keep his name in the draft,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.060]   but he wants to stay over in Europe for one more year.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.900]   And we're in a phase at the time
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.860]   where we wanted as many young players as we could get,
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.100]   and to try to see what we could grow.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.060]   And so I was actually like,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.780]   why does he wanna stay over in Europe one more year?
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.140]   And both Tim and Arturis were like,
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.860]   it's best for his development,
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.580]   and we think that there's a skill level there
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.940]   that could be interesting.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.220]   But I remember them showing me on tape,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.260]   and Nikola's wearing like this,
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.260]   their colors were like pink and blue,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.140]   and Nikola couldn't jump over a phone book,
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.380]   but he'd catch these balls,
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.540]   and he'd throw these passes that you were like,
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.340]   I don't know how that's gonna translate,
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.500]   but that player's basketball IQ
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.540]   was obviously off the charts.
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.140]   And so we drafted him, he stayed over for one more year,
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.300]   and then he came over in the summer of 2015,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.660]   and my dad actually has really good stories
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.340]   about being down in the weight room
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.700]   early in the morning that summer,
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.380]   and Nikola would be in there every morning
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.540]   with his two brothers, and they'd be beating on him
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.180]   kind of before the coaches would even come in,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.420]   and he'd be in there, but over time,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.260]   I think Nikola cleaned up his diet,
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.420]   he understood what it took to be a professional,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.500]   and you referenced Yusef Nurkic,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.340]   who was another really good young player
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.660]   that we had on our roster at the time,
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.580]   and we couldn't quite tell what to do with both of them,
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.100]   'cause Yusef, I think, had made second team All-Rookie,
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.820]   and Nikola was coming over,
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.380]   and so we had a very established center,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.980]   but we knew that they both had really good hands,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.500]   really good skills, and the thing that was unfortunate
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.980]   is the league was trending,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.260]   that was when the Warriors were on their ascension,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.140]   and the league was trending to this small ball,
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.780]   shooting everywhere, and even more extreme
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.260]   than it is now, almost.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.460]   It was like everyone wanted to try to be the Warriors
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.500]   almost overnight, and you couldn't play Nikola
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.900]   and Yusef together.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.220]   You had two seven-footers that were incredibly skilled
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.680]   and very unselfish guys, but trying to play them together,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.060]   while it did present its advantages at certain points,
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.180]   it was tough for them to cover
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.940]   whenever you got kind of almost four guards out there
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.760]   moving around in sync, and it's a tough defensive cover.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.940]   So we had to really kind of put our heads together
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.980]   on what we wanted to do, and fortunately,
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   by the time, after Nikola's first season,
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.580]   I think he made first-team All-Rookie,
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.700]   and then we were halfway into the second year,
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.820]   and we were really realizing that we couldn't,
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.340]   we had to pick, we had to choose,
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.180]   'cause they're both starting-level centers,
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.240]   and I think Yusef's contract was coming up in about a year,
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.820]   and so we were having our analytics group
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.620]   run all the different numbers of how to compare the two
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.980]   and what to look for, and all of a sudden,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.140]   this comparison comes through, and fortunately,
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.260]   we had enough data at the time to be able
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   to really put together per 36 minutes
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.660]   and compare different things,
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.060]   and so this comparison comes through,
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.060]   and it's Player A and Player B,
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.980]   and it was during their second season,
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.140]   and the only difference of the two
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.980]   is that Player A is two years older than Player B
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.860]   at the time of their second year in the NBA.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.300]   Player A just entered the league later,
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.340]   and you could clearly see that Player B's numbers
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.500]   were better in really every category,
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.940]   and so I was like, okay, I'm gonna guess
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.020]   that Player B is Nikola, and they're like,
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.780]   yep, you're right, Player B is Nikola,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.620]   and I'm like, all right, well then,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.860]   who are we talking about with Player A,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.900]   or is this some sort of comparison with Nurk,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.420]   or is this some sort of comparison
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.300]   with someone else in the league,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.120]   and they're like, Player A is Larry Bird.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.860]   (laughing)
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.980]   And I was like, oh.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.660]   - Like you looked at the per 36?
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.380]   - Yeah, and so that was when I think all of us
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.860]   kind of looked at each other like,
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.060]   because sometimes when you talk to a basketball purist,
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.740]   even, to your point, Nikola's skill set
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.180]   and the way that he plays, the eye test,
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.180]   he doesn't jump out at you right away,
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.740]   but when you watch it over time,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.260]   and you understand what he's doing,
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.460]   and how he's affecting a game,
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.220]   it really jumps out at you,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.020]   and so that was when, and that was in,
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.180]   that was like the first week of December,
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.060]   and I think we were on a four or five game skid at the time,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.380]   and then Tim and I wound up on the phone,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.220]   and I was like, Tim, I was like,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.500]   I'm never gonna tell anyone who to play,
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.160]   any coach what to do, but if we're gonna pick one,
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.380]   tell 'em to put Nikola in, and we gotta roll with it,
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.340]   and then that was the famous,
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.640]   the next night or the night after was,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.940]   the date was at December or something,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.820]   when that was when Yoke went into the starting lineup
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.900]   and never came out.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.580]   - Never looked back, and it's crazy 'cause--
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.380]   - It was in Dallas, I think, yeah.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.620]   - Yeah, I have unlimited Nikola stories too,
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.880]   talking about the cleaning up the diet and stuff,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.340]   my first couple years, I mean, he cared about basketball,
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.540]   but he would go home to Serbia in the summer
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.860]   and come back out of shape.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.940]   I've seen him progress every year,
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.280]   even from MVP year to MVP year, he's somehow progressing,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.480]   so you guys obviously made the right choice, man.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.740]   There's a lot of talk about his number, number 15,
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.740]   and him and Carmelo Anthony.
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.260]   I don't even know the whole story of what came out,
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.140]   but yeah, talk a little bit about your thoughts
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.500]   on that whole situation.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.860]   - Yeah, that's a funny one.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.780]   I saw Melo was on something fairly recently,
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.440]   and my first, it's interesting to think back,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.660]   because my first meeting when I was put in charge
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.060]   of the Nuggets in the summer of 2010
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.140]   was to fly to Baltimore and sit in a hotel room
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.400]   where it was he, his agent, and one other guy
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.020]   that worked with him, and he asked to be traded.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.100]   And they gave us two teams,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:12.100]   and I put that in my back pocket, went back to Denver.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.860]   I was kind of, our front office was in flux at the time.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.540]   And then I wound up hiring a guy named Masai Ujiri,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.980]   now runs the Toronto Raptors.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.860]   And then he and I, and another person named Pete D'Alessandro
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.580]   worked on that trade for about six months.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.800]   And so we got through the trade,
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.460]   and you don't really think about much.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.620]   We had Allen Iverson for a number of years,
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.140]   and Ty Lawson wore number three.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.620]   And so it's not anything that really ever crossed our mind.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.900]   And so I was very surprised to hear Carmelo say that
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.460]   the other day, because it wasn't something
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.380]   that ever crossed my mind.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.540]   I think Nikola has worn number 15 his entire career,
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.500]   even when he was over in Europe.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.580]   And so it wasn't something that really crossed our mind.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.100]   And to have Nikola, I think,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.780]   ascend to the level that he's at,
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.460]   maybe that might get under somebody's skin, I guess,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.540]   perhaps, but I don't know.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.500]   I think Nikola's always worn 15.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.780]   It was never anything that we ever thought about,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.900]   and I'm just happy that Nikola's on our team.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.500]   - And what specifically was Melo upset about?
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.900]   Was it that someone else got to wear his number,
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.660]   his number didn't get retired?
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.820]   - I'm not 100% sure.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:32.180]   I think Melo, he had an unbelievable career with us.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.760]   He really put the Nuggets back on the map
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.420]   in a really positive way.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.100]   I think that there was a...
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.020]   It's interesting when a player
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.100]   wants to be traded from a team,
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.660]   and that creates certain feelings.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.500]   - Yeah.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.620]   - And it took a while for our fan base in Denver
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.460]   to get over that as well.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.100]   It was an interesting scenario
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.660]   because that whole saga really started
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:01.500]   the summer before, the summer of 2010.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.620]   That was when LeBron had left Miami,
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.780]   or excuse me, left Cleveland to go to Miami.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.100]   And so player empowerment and movement
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.340]   was really kind of just starting to reach its peak.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.660]   And I think that's great.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.780]   I think you guys have one shot at your careers.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.740]   We're kind of custodians of that career.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.540]   We obviously have our own goals
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.820]   in trying to build our teams,
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.580]   but I always respect if somebody
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.740]   wants to go do something else.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.500]   But for the city of Denver,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.420]   I think they took it very personally.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.380]   And that took a little time for the city to get over.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.640]   And I'm sure Melo didn't like being booed
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.700]   for the first few times he came back because he did.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.980]   He worked his butt off for the city
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.780]   and we had a great run in there.
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.500]   We made the Western Conference Finals in 2009.
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:43.340]   Only made it out of the first,
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.820]   that was the only time we made it out of the first round.
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.820]   But I think over time, hopefully the feelings dissipate.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.980]   I think if he was to come back to Denver,
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.240]   I think he'd probably get a different reception these days.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.420]   But from a personal level,
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.900]   there was never any animosity or anything
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.540]   kind of on our thinking about Nicola's number.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.380]   - Right.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.920]   - Because it was just the number that he wanted to wear
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.680]   and the number that he's worn forever.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.000]   I think that it's been interesting
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.640]   to see his ascension to where he is.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.700]   But to think that, for anyone to think
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.420]   that we gave a second round pick, number 15,
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.100]   and knowing that it would someday turn into this,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.940]   I think that's a pretty wild statement.
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.780]   - Multiple times.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.600]   (laughing)
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.440]   - Yeah.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.280]   - That's funny, man.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.820]   Well, you guys have done an incredible job.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.020]   I wanna talk a little bit about your guys' thought process
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.420]   with me coming into the league.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.580]   Obviously, you were both from Columbia,
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.020]   so you had known about me and things like that,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.460]   but I had been through a lot.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.860]   The Clippers doctor spread the report throughout the league
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.900]   that they didn't know,
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.180]   they weren't sure if I'd be able to play basketball,
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.380]   considering my injuries.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.660]   And a lot of teams were scared away by that.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.220]   I remember the first time I got on the phone
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.120]   with the Nuggets was with Tim Conley on the day of the draft
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.220]   because my agent wanted to kind of create a floor,
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.620]   like, okay, if he drops it here,
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.060]   this team will take him.
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.580]   So I had no idea going into the draft
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.540]   what was gonna happen.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.840]   What were those conversations like behind doors about me?
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.180]   - Well, my Michael Porter Jr. story first starts,
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.420]   I think you were in seventh or eighth grade.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.700]   A friend of mine sent me this link
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.200]   of some unknown skinny kid going up for a dunk.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.040]   - Yeah.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.540]   - And I was like, wow.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.260]   I was like, this kid's supposedly
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.460]   the best eighth grader in the country.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.300]   And I was like, wow.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.500]   And he's like, I've never seen an eighth grader
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.900]   look at the rim, almost, like you were.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.820]   And then I was like, wait a minute.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.700]   I'm like, that's Jeff City's gym.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:39.540]   That's Jefferson City.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.420]   I'm like, that's, I know that gym.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.980]   We're my high school rivals.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.580]   And so I did a quick search to try to find out more
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.940]   of what I was watching.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.180]   And I was quickly told that Central Missouri
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.620]   had one of the best players in the country.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.540]   And, 'cause I was like, that section of the country
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.360]   doesn't produce talent like you.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.140]   And so I was very aware of who you were from an early age.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.340]   And I followed your career 'cause I was kind of proud
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.120]   that we had someone of your caliber coming out
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.980]   of that section of the state.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.220]   And so I followed your career.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.420]   And then I was gonna watch your first game in Mizzou.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.700]   And then I heard about what had happened.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.060]   And I think you were going through warmups, right?
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.780]   Or it was a couple of days leading up to it
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.900]   where you had some tightness, right?
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.340]   - Yeah, the injury, it happened a few days prior.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.980]   But that was my first time experiencing anything strange.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.220]   So I thought it would just dissipate.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.060]   And it got worse.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.180]   And the first game comes around.
[00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.420]   - Yeah, and you were going through warmups.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.300]   And then I think you had to play, what,
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.740]   the first 10 seconds before they--
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.580]   - Yeah.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.400]   - It was so close to game time.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.240]   They'd already turned in the lineup, right?
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.080]   - It was so close to game time.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.900]   They had already put the lineup up.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.500]   So I go to my dad.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.900]   And I'm like, Dad, I don't think I can play.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.740]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.700]   But I can't jump right.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.100]   I can't produce force like I want to.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.820]   And then we went to the coaches.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.780]   And they were like, okay, you just have to start the game
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.940]   because big national TV game.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.100]   You know, number one player in the country
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.300]   going to the University of Missouri,
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.420]   you know, which never happens.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.260]   And then, so yeah, I had to play the first 10 seconds
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.100]   and came out.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:08.920]   - Yep.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.340]   And then I followed, you know, I followed what was going on.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.820]   And I knew you came, you were really rushing to get back
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.700]   because you wanted to help your team.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.220]   And, you know, that told me a lot about your character.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.520]   You know, if you were already thinking about the pros,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.300]   which is a natural thing, you know,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.020]   I think that there's probably part of you
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.340]   that wants to think ultra long-term in that scenario.
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.460]   And I'm sure there was people around you,
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:37.540]   but it also told me that there was a person inside of you,
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.020]   inside of that player that was really competitive
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.220]   that wanted to get out there
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.100]   and you wanted to help your teammates.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:47.220]   And so, you know, as I watched that spring kind of evolve
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.080]   and I heard about your draft workouts,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.140]   leading into that week, I thought your floor in the draft,
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:57.960]   I think Chicago had seven and seven or eight.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.580]   But I also knew that when you were healthy,
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.420]   you were probably the best,
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.260]   if not one of the top two or three players in that draft.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.260]   And we had just missed the playoffs by one game that year.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.060]   And we were thinking that we were,
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.460]   once we made it back to the playoffs,
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.080]   we knew we weren't going backwards.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.300]   We had a good young team and we just had a few things
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.820]   that we needed to, we thought,
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.000]   to really put us in a new level.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.420]   And so the day of the draft, I remember coming over
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.220]   and Tim had called me the night before the draft
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.340]   and he goes, "Hey, I'm just gonna put something
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.180]   "on your radar."
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.420]   I was like, "What's up?"
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.780]   Because by missing the playoffs by one game,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.900]   we picked 14 in the lottery.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.140]   And so Tim called me, he's like,
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.300]   "Hey, I wanna put something on your radar."
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.140]   And I'm like, "What's up?"
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.680]   And he goes, "I heard something from a buddy of mine
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.860]   "that Chicago might pass."
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.640]   And I'm like, "But I thought you told me earlier today
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.460]   "that that was Michael's floor."
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.420]   And he goes, "I don't know."
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.320]   He goes, "I don't know what happened.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.740]   "I'm still trying to gather the information.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:01.980]   "I'll talk to you about it in the morning."
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.100]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.500]   And so I came in the day of the draft
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.860]   and Tim Arturas and I sit down and they said
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.560]   that you may have had a spasm or something,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.140]   like at a workout, and it might've scared a few teams.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:15.140]   And I was like, "Really?"
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.200]   I was like, "This is just, can we get more data on it?
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.060]   "Is there any kind of..."
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.080]   And they're like, "We're still trying to piece it together,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.780]   "but he could fall."
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.280]   And I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.160]   And I was like, "Guys, that skill set
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.360]   "does not grow on trees."
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.520]   I was like, "What do you mean he could fall?"
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.780]   And they're like, "Well, the teams could get scared
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.760]   "of the back."
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.480]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   And so then I rang my dad and he came down that afternoon
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.020]   and then the four of us, Arturas, Tim, myself, my dad,
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.480]   and we pulled Coach Malone in as well.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.240]   And we said, "Look, if he's there, we're gonna take him."
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.020]   And we got all our doctors in
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.560]   and it was a really great group experience
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.200]   because we all had to put our heads together
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.580]   from our own perspective.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.080]   Tim and Arturas knew that they believed
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.320]   in your skill set and your talent.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.380]   And then you had Coach Malone who was understanding
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.200]   that this is something that was gonna play out
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.440]   over multiple years, whereas a lot of coaches,
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:15.000]   and this is their job, coaches have one responsibility,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.640]   that's win the next game.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.520]   And so you have to put,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.240]   and then our perspective is even further,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.520]   it's how can we create the best talent over time.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.320]   And so when your name was still there,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.440]   it was a no-brainer for us.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.220]   It might sound funny to some people,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.420]   but I was really worried that the,
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.000]   because you referenced a team that had two picks ahead of us
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.640]   and I thought somebody might take a chance.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.240]   Somebody's gotta take a chance.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.600]   - I think they may have if it wasn't for their doctor
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.360]   that was doing the main analysis on me that day.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.680]   And so our decision in the room that day
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.760]   when we all kind of walked out
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.240]   after discussing the different concerns and thoughts
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.040]   from all of our own perspectives was,
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.300]   we'll never have a chance to draft another player
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.000]   like you, especially at that point in time
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.120]   with the group of players that we had,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.120]   the skill set that you brought,
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.920]   and you could raise our ceiling immensely.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.680]   But we knew it wasn't gonna be right away.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.440]   And so we had to, once we drafted you,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.800]   we got you in, we let our doctors take a look at you.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.240]   We made sure that you felt like one of the family
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.140]   and we knew that there was gonna be a long journey ahead.
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.240]   And I think you may have known, but you probably,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.680]   looking back, you maybe didn't even realize
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.840]   what you were gonna have to go through.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.200]   And so you had another surgery.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.120]   We sat you out that whole first year.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.200]   We tried to make you feel like you're a part of the group.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.720]   Hopefully you did, even though you weren't getting to play.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.680]   But I remember coming over to training camp
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.280]   that first year when, I don't even think you could play,
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.160]   all you could do is just do standstill shooting.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   And our shooting coach at the time was, was it Mark Price?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.880]   - Mark Price. - Yeah, Mark Price.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.960]   See, I remember.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.120]   And Mark and I were standing there and I was like,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.200]   "Mark, what do you think of our group?"
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.280]   And he goes, "Wow, there's some really good young players."
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.520]   And that was when he started to ask about Nikola.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.800]   Nikola was just starting to really show
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.480]   the level that he could dominate.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.520]   And I was like, "What do you think?"
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.480]   And he goes, "I think you got a really great group here."
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.320]   He goes, "But I'll tell you what."
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.800]   He goes, "Best shooter in this gym can't play right now."
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.360]   And I was like, "You're talking about Michael, right?"
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.200]   And he goes, "Yep."
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   He goes, "I'm talking about Michael."
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.160]   He goes, "Take your time with him, be patient."
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.040]   But he goes, "That guy's the best shooter in this gym."
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.280]   And I said, "Well, that's our plan."
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.120]   And so, over the course of that year,
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.360]   and then I think your first full season
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.160]   was the COVID year, right?
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.400]   - Yeah, our first full season was the first half
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.320]   of that season, and then we go to the bubble.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.160]   Yeah, that was my first full season.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.320]   - And so, I saw an important step out of you,
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.880]   which was over the first, I don't know,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.400]   six months of the season, I think you were up and down
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.640]   as any rookie is gonna be.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.680]   You're learning how to play.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.840]   You're learning where you fit in the different roles,
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.680]   and you're learning how to play
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.480]   with some of these guys around you.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.640]   And then the season stops,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.600]   like right around this time four years ago.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.480]   COVID hits, we go into our cocoons,
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.880]   and then we emerge in the bubble a few months later.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   And you went from a rookie to a second year player
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.640]   in that little two month span.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.720]   - In that gap, yeah.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.840]   - And so, when you came into that bubble,
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.240]   I saw a different Michael.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.720]   I saw a more confident Michael.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.280]   I saw one that knew how to fit within our team,
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.400]   but also went to really use your own skillset
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.760]   to drive us forward.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.400]   And I remember you hitting some big shots in the bubble.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.960]   And seeing our team really start to believe in each other.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.360]   And I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:46.200]   - That's crazy.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.440]   - But then you come out of that,
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.000]   it's kind of a very short off season.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.120]   We lose Jeremy, we replace him with Aaron,
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.320]   and then Jamal gets hurt.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.840]   And so I knew there was a special group in there,
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.520]   and then you have to wait almost two years.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.920]   And that required a lot of patience on our end.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.120]   And we never even remotely thought
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.960]   about veering off the path of the roster that we had.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.040]   And now that we got everybody healthy,
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.800]   I could see that you guys last fall,
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.120]   there was a little bit of a period
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.960]   where you kind of had to play your way into it again.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.640]   Jamal had to play his way into it again,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   gain that confidence in your body.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.640]   And then by March, I could tell we were locked in,
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.400]   and that we were just ready for the playoffs.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.280]   And then it was like, okay, let's be healthy come April
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.420]   and see where the chips fall.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.560]   And I was really proud of the way
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.800]   that you guys just immediately locked in
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.960]   to go 16 and four against the NBA's best shot.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:46.000]   That's not something that a lot of people can say.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.280]   - Well, man, I mean, man to man,
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.120]   I appreciate you guys so much taking the chance on me.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.960]   - Appreciate you, man.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   - I remember I said at draft night,
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.120]   I was gonna do whatever I could to be
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.920]   one of the best draft picks that you guys could ever draft.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.960]   And still, I've been through a lot,
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.720]   but like you saw at Mizzou,
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.000]   giving up and giving in to whatever injuries,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.720]   that's not part of my DNA.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.880]   But I'm so happy to be a nugget.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.160]   People ask me all the time about that whole draft situation,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.360]   and I'm like, God does work in mysterious ways
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.200]   'cause it's a blessing that somehow I fell to 14
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.120]   to a team that was already winning.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.720]   So I got to take my time
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:25.600]   and not rush back after the injury.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.400]   And now we've just built this program,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.280]   this championship level program from really the ground up
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.460]   with adding small pieces.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.480]   And we got it continued rolling with the young guys.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.640]   We got now Peyton, CB.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.960]   I know Julian's not playing right now,
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.600]   but Julian, some of the guards we got.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.560]   So it's pretty crazy.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.600]   So you go through all this stuff,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.680]   the ups and downs as an owner,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.800]   and then you win the championship.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.640]   How fulfilling was that?
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.800]   I know you guys had already won the Rams championship,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.680]   the Avs championship,
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.480]   but it probably felt a little bit different
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.960]   being a basketball player.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.640]   - Yeah, I mean, I think I'm kidding myself
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.080]   if I try to say that it didn't.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.320]   But I think I'm most proud
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.560]   because while the Rams had won a championship
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.760]   20 years ago in St. Louis,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.420]   the Avs had won twice before in Denver,
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.440]   but not since 2001.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.600]   The Nuggets had never won one.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.400]   They'd never even been to the NBA finals.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.560]   And so I got goosebumps walking around the arena
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.920]   just seeing the NBA finals logo for the first time.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   But the process of going through it with the Rams,
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.820]   the Avalanche, and in the middle of the Rams
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.740]   and the Avalanche winning in 2022,
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.300]   our major league lacrosse team won a championship as well.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.460]   And Arsenal has been knocking on the door of a few things.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.380]   We got a good young group.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.540]   We grew up pretty organically over there as well.
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.820]   So there's a formula to kind of what we try to do.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.180]   But the NBA one was very special for my dad and I,
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.460]   mainly because it had never been done before.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.300]   And to be frank,
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.380]   we had a lot of people telling us that we couldn't do it.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:08.020]   When I made some changes to the Nuggets coaching staff
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.720]   and we started to kind of go through our building process,
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.340]   like I said, progress isn't linear.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.740]   And so I would go down,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.540]   be around the court during games at times,
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.680]   and I'd have people screaming at me,
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.100]   "What are you doing, you idiot?"
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.940]   We just want to see a competitive team.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.140]   And we can't believe your dad trusts you
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.880]   with all this and everything.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.940]   And so I heard it all, but you stay the course,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.780]   you believe in kind of what you're doing.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.660]   And so when you finally do reach the pinnacle of it all,
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.380]   and you realize that all those people
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.680]   that were doubting you are now supporting you,
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.980]   it's a great feeling.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   But it was also,
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.600]   I didn't realize how rewarding I would find it
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.460]   as I'm walking down the street and someone grabs me
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.640]   and they're like, "Man, I've been a Nuggets fan since 1978."
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.140]   Like, "I can die happy now."
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.220]   And those little moments where you're like,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.820]   "Wow, you didn't realize how much
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.340]   "this was gonna really touch people."
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.060]   You get so locked in on trying to figure out a way to do it
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.780]   that you forget how many people that are along for the ride
[00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.340]   and really supporting you along the way.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.900]   And I've watched the Game 5 50 times at this point,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.420]   where you just start to count down and it never gets old,
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.260]   man.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.500]   And so the cool thing was, though,
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   was I knew on Monday afternoon that we won it on a Monday,
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.960]   and I knew on Monday afternoon, I was like,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.020]   "You know, if I wake up tomorrow,
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.520]   "I'll either be a champion or we're not,
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.700]   "and I'm still gonna be the same person.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.020]   "And if we lose tonight,
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.320]   "we're gonna go down to Miami and try and do it again.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.020]   "And if we win, I'll wake up a champion,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.040]   "but nothing's really gonna change.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.480]   "And we'll figure out a way to go try to do it again."
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.560]   And so the perspective
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.360]   of having those other championships recently
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.960]   really kinda keeps you humble.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.720]   You know you've really accomplished something great,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   but at the same time, when you do get that taste of success,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.460]   I think as a competitor, we all want more.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.080]   And that's the cool thing that I really see about you guys,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.080]   is I think that even though you accomplished something
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.400]   for the first time in all of your careers,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:11.320]   I see a collective focus starting to form here
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.540]   as we're coming down the stretch.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.280]   And I mean, there's a lot of things that go into it.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.240]   And at the end of the day,
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.800]   I think that people need to understand,
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.760]   no matter how you build these teams,
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.520]   and how you think you may have a chance,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.560]   you need a little bit of luck involved.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.040]   We need to have our health.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   We need to have our group together.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.080]   And so you never know what could happen.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:30.540]   But I'm really proud of the group.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.680]   I'm really proud of the focus.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.640]   And if we're healthy, I think it'll be a tough team to beat,
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.420]   which is always the goal.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.320]   - Yeah, I think you said two really nuggets of wisdom.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.460]   First of all was throughout the whole process of life,
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.700]   and even as athletes, as competitors,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.440]   is the joy you put on other people's face.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.440]   Something Nicola mentioned as well in the interview
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.360]   was like, those are the things that stick with you.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah, the championship is amazing.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.200]   But like you said, you wake up tomorrow
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.360]   and you're still the same person, you know.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.080]   But it's like those moments along the way,
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.660]   or I go to Taiwan this off season and they could not,
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.260]   like, it was like diehard Nuggets fans in Taiwan
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.740]   that are talking about the championship, you know.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.120]   So I think that's--
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.440]   - You guys put yourselves on the map in a whole new way
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.720]   with one, I mean, winning the championship,
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.400]   but I think two, how you guys all carry yourself.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.480]   That's what makes me just as proud as winning
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.880]   because I think you guys, like I said,
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.920]   we play a brand of basketball that's really fun
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.200]   for people to watch and hopefully at the youth level
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   you have a lot of coaches saying,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.240]   you guys should play like them, you know.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.740]   You and your father and your family as a whole
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.640]   have built something incredible.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.840]   A lot of people think being financially stable
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.060]   or wealthy is the goal of life.
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.560]   You guys right now could sell your teams,
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.280]   you could take all the money and live perfectly comfortable
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.780]   the rest of your life, your kids, your kids' kids.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.900]   Why do you continue, after you reach the success
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.600]   that you have, why do you continue to grind
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.880]   and work so hard and fly to London and back
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.640]   and do all these things?
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.480]   Is it just, because a lot of people truly think
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.340]   that happiness in life equals money,
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.040]   but you guys could just go chill on the beach
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.200]   and do whatever you want the rest of your life.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.540]   Why do you keep going?
[00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:26.700]   - I mean, for me individually I always wanna prove stuff
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.640]   to myself to see if I can do something.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.820]   And I actually, you know, I really enjoy,
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.520]   even though I'm kind of an introvert in certain ways
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.340]   and I'm very guarded in others, I do enjoy people.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:45.820]   And being around the sports world I have to pinch myself,
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.360]   some of the people that I get to meet,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.060]   some of the people I get to interact with,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.500]   because we're from all walks of life, all over the world.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.380]   You know, you mentioned Arsenal.
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.700]   I just got back from London last night
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.740]   and we advanced in the Champions League on Tuesday.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.500]   But, you know, the people that I get to meet,
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.700]   you know, I mean, just with the nuggets alone.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.580]   I mean, we have guys from all over Europe.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.340]   When you get to Arsenal, it's even a greater expansion
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.540]   of people and so I really enjoy the different people,
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.300]   the different walks of life and being able to prove myself
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.860]   to myself that I can work with almost anybody
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.660]   and try to get the best out of a group.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.340]   I think, you know, to your point,
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.220]   I don't know where my IQ might be,
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.340]   but I think my EQ is fairly high.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.440]   And, you know, putting people in positions,
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.820]   giving them the resources to succeed,
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.820]   patting them on the back,
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.340]   putting my arm around them when they need it,
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.820]   and then, you know, give them a little kick in the butt
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.420]   when they need it too.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.300]   But, you know, our formula is to really hire good people,
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:43.180]   provide them with the resources to go do things,
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.740]   and then draft, you know, good people
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.460]   who can have a chance to be great players
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.620]   and try to grow it over time.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.540]   And, you know, that's what we've done with the Nuggets.
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.220]   That's what we've done with the Avalanche.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.380]   You know, over at Arsenal, we have a really,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.780]   you know, we have a talented young team
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.060]   that's fighting for, you know,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.820]   both Premier League title this year
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.580]   and hopefully another advancement in the Champions League
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:03.420]   in the quarters.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.660]   We just drew Bayern Munich today.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.900]   That's gonna be an interesting one.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.460]   - Yeah.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.340]   - But, you know, it's really about the people.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.380]   And for me, that's what drives me.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.380]   But yeah, I mean, I have been financially secure
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.220]   my whole life.
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.140]   I understand that most people, a lot of people,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.820]   aren't in that situation.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.740]   And so I never want to take that for granted.
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:24.180]   But also, you know, we employ a lot of people.
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.340]   You know, that's something that I do find very rewarding
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.780]   is being able to sit down and talk to people
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:30.620]   about their jobs, whether it's over in London,
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.380]   whether it's in Denver, or whether it's in LA,
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.220]   at our team and our venue out there.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.740]   So yeah, for me, it's about the people
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.220]   and trying to work together to achieve something special.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.900]   And when you do achieve something special, man,
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.260]   it's a lot of fun for not only the group,
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.940]   but for the fans as well,
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.740]   which is really unique to really the sports business.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.820]   - Yeah, no, even just talking to you,
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.940]   I feel like, you know, the way you grew up
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.580]   and just who you are as a person,
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.260]   and I feel like you really know yourself.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.220]   You've probably spent a lot of time getting to know yourself
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.380]   and what makes you happy.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.820]   So one of the questions I like to ask,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.660]   like all the people I interview on this podcast is,
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.220]   what do you think your purpose is?
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.060]   - Wow.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:14.020]   I think my purpose is,
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.340]   that's a great question, Michael.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.740]   I wish I knew when you were gonna ask me that one.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.940]   (laughing)
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.020]   - I ask it because I still feel like
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.260]   I'm trying to develop my purpose.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.860]   And part of who I like to get on this podcast
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:30.300]   is people that I find very intriguing
[00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.660]   and I'm very curious about,
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.540]   and people I look up to in certain ways.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.660]   So yeah, I'm trying to figure out,
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:38.660]   so it's just a question I like to ask.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.220]   - You know, I think that, I'm sure you,
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:42.340]   I'd be very, I'd have to go back
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.500]   and re-watch some of your podcasts
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:45.600]   because that'd be a very curious answer
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.380]   from a lot of different people.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.340]   For me, I think my purpose,
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.260]   you know, I'm not married, I don't have any kids yet,
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.860]   and so some people would answer, you know,
[00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.660]   family or this, and so I have,
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.820]   I come from a great family, great parents,
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.020]   my older sister's incredibly supportive,
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.460]   and I have a wonderful girlfriend who supports me as well.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.260]   But I think for me personally,
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.620]   I think my purpose is to,
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:12.540]   you know, I think kind of how I answered
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.140]   the previous question was,
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.780]   I really enjoy getting to know people
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.240]   and trying to get the most out of them.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.600]   My college coach, Quinn Snyder,
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.640]   always thought I would have been a great basketball coach
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.920]   because I loved the game,
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.700]   but I also really loved trying to get the most
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.800]   and help my teammates.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.920]   And so that kind of plays out in my life
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.240]   across numerous areas,
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.960]   whether it's focused in on the team level
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.580]   with the Nuggets, Avs, Rams, Arsenal, Rapids,
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:43.200]   or on the corporate level,
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.020]   we just wonder when a big restructure
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.260]   on our corporate side in Denver,
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.300]   and so putting together the team there
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.520]   and kind of delivering some of the same mantras
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.940]   that we have around our team culture,
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.760]   try to deliver that on the corporate side as well.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.620]   And having been around sports my whole life,
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.300]   I think I got a pretty decent handle
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.980]   on certain things at this point.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.500]   And so trying to get the most out of people
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.260]   and then really going to achieve something together.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:09.260]   So building a team and helping those people along,
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.980]   I think that'd be probably how I would answer it
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.180]   on an individual level,
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:17.200]   because when I'm by myself and doing things by myself,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.740]   I enjoy it, but I enjoy being around people
