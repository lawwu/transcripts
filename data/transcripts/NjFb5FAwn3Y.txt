[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.540]   - Welcome to another episode of Curious Mike.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.700]   I'm here with Josh Kroenke, fellow Columbia, Missourian.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.540]   I appreciate you on the podcast, man.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.380]   - Absolutely, man.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.960]   - I know you don't do a lot of media, so I appreciate it.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.580]   - No, man, it's my pleasure to be here,
[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.660]   especially like, as you said,
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060]   with a fellow Columbia, Missourian.
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.900]   - Yes, sir.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.060]   - We're a rare breed up here.
[00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.660]   - We are a rare breed, yeah.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.600]   I wanna start off a little bit with your childhood
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.720]   because I find it interesting, you know,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.300]   growing up, your father was obviously already very wealthy.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.760]   I don't know if it was to the point that it is now,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.320]   but like you just being around you
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900]   and how down to earth you are,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.040]   I find that intriguing just in the way you came up.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.080]   So talk a little bit about, you know, growing up,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.300]   regular things like high school and things like that.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.320]   Talk about your childhood.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   - Well, yeah, I mean, and you know, you know,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600]   as we affectionately say back home, Como, very well.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300]   And I was born and raised in Central Missouri,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.720]   Columbia to be exact.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.000]   And yeah, I mean, I do come from a background
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   where I've been financially secure,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.180]   very secure my entire life.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.120]   But, you know, my parents,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.580]   I think they did an unbelievable job
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.800]   of raising both my older sister and I to understand that,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.600]   you know, to feel blessed in the position that we're in,
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.160]   but don't let it define you in any way.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.480]   We're all humans and we're all kind of going through
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.800]   this experience in our own kind of different versions
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.180]   of how we're experiencing life.
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.720]   And, but being from Columbia, I think is a,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   it's a college town.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600]   There's a lot of really good people in there.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.900]   And, you know, the sport of basketball really is the thing
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.040]   that really kind of kept me grounded, you know,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.440]   going through junior high and high school
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.340]   and then playing at Mizzou, you know,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.640]   you experience people from all walks of life.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   And so some of my best friends from a very early age,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.240]   I understood didn't come from as fortunate
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.280]   of a background as myself, from a two-parent home,
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.020]   from a financially secure home.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.200]   And so I understand, or I understood at an early age
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.600]   how fortunate I was.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.800]   And my parents didn't ever let me forget that.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.920]   - Yeah.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.680]   Yeah, I find, I think about it all the time,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.440]   like even raising kids of my own one day,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.080]   like people always talk about once you make money,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.760]   you want to make money for your kids, kids,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.580]   and all these things.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.440]   But when you really think about it,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.000]   I think about like, would I be here today
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.920]   if I had parents who were very stable?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.240]   One of the things that pushed me to even be successful
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.660]   is the fact that I had, you know, my family,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.360]   I have seven siblings, my mom was a stay-at-home mom,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.320]   you know, I wanted to make it so that they could be okay.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.360]   So I just find that interesting
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.260]   when people just stay super down to earth,
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.960]   regardless of their circumstances.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.480]   - Yeah, and for me, there was also a motivation to,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.320]   with the basketball part, to kind of forge my own identity.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.440]   - Right.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   - You know, being in Columbia, and it is a college town,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.520]   but it's a small town in certain ways.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.840]   And so, you know, being around sports,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.240]   I realized that I could forge my own identity
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.000]   in the shadow of kind of my father, my grandfather,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.800]   my parents, and all the success that they've had.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   And so sports was a big impact on me.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.520]   - Do you feel like you had to become at an early age,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.240]   like a very good judge of character,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.300]   even like just with friends that you would hang around,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.400]   but you know, when it comes to dating or girls,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.020]   like, is that something you felt like
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.880]   you had to develop pretty early on?
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.160]   - Yeah, you know, I don't think I'm the sharpest tool
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   in the shed when it comes to certain things,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.000]   but you know, I think my EQ and reading people,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   I'm fairly decent at it.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.520]   You know, I remember being in like fourth grade,
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320]   and I just moved into a new house.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.960]   And I remember overhearing someone in the lunch line
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.980]   saying they wanted to become my friend
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.880]   so they could come see my house, my parents' house.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.920]   And so when you're that little, it's interesting,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.020]   'cause it kind of takes you back,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.960]   because it's not anything
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   that you've ever really thought about,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.800]   but it does, you know, put your guard up in certain ways.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.960]   And so, you know, I've had to do a lot of personal work
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.960]   on trust and understanding that, you know,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.240]   not everybody's out to get you.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.160]   Not everybody's guilty until proven innocent, you know?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.020]   But when it comes to relationships with other people,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.400]   and especially relationships with women,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.960]   I did have to, you know, overcome some certain fears
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.280]   in myself because there are good people in this world,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   not everybody's out to get you.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.940]   And so reading that and understanding that,
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.340]   giving people the benefit of the doubt,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.100]   but also being slightly guarded, you know,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.000]   that was definitely something I had to develop over time,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.640]   but very early on.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.360]   - Yeah, it's a hurdle, I think, even, you know,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.680]   that I go through.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.520]   - Yeah.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.820]   - And I've noticed, you know, even like being around you
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.720]   at the Super Bowl, which was amazing,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.920]   you're still around a lot of the same people
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   that you kind of grew up with,
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.000]   like hearing them talk and talk about you and stuff
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.200]   and how proud they were of you.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.520]   And their stories were always like,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.240]   I'm knowing Josh forever.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.220]   So I think it's cool that you kind of stay around
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.060]   the same people that you--
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.720]   - Yeah, you know, we've, and I still got a few buddies
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.980]   that I grew up playing basketball with.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.580]   Kareem, I think was at, Kareem Rush was at the game.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.160]   But yeah, I mean, you know, I think, you know,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.400]   as life evolves and I have friends that I've just made
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.280]   within the last few years
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.640]   that have become good friends of mine.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.280]   But I do have a core group of guys
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.600]   and a group of friends from back home.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.880]   Definitely from Mizzou, a couple guys from Kansas City
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.000]   and guys that I just kind of was grew up around
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.480]   from late teens to early 20s
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.880]   and a lot of formative years in there.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.960]   And I think it's important to, you know,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.440]   stay in touch with people, understand that people grow
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.840]   and they sometimes they grow apart,
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.680]   but you always have a little bit of a bond
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.920]   and check in with people
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.600]   because you never know what people are going through.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.440]   - 100%.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.260]   - Yeah.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.880]   - And basketball was a big part of your childhood.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.080]   Talk about, you know, going to Mizzou,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.240]   were you nice, were you like,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.120]   were you, you actually got buckets, were you nice?
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.960]   How was that?
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.040]   - Well, I definitely wasn't getting buckets like you,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   trust me on that one.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.960]   But yeah, I mean, I was like a top 50,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.720]   top 75 recruit in high school.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.440]   Went to Rockbridge in Columbia
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.560]   and actually my senior year, I hurt my knee.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.640]   I didn't tear my ACL, but I had my left kneecap
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.440]   with sublux and kind of come out of the alignment.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.360]   And so I had to have it scoped
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.080]   and I came back way too soon
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.880]   because I really wanted to play as my senior year.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.280]   And so, but I could tell that I wasn't right.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.000]   And so after the season was over,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I took a little time and thought about it.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.640]   And I did, I did decided to do a fifth year
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.720]   and went to prep school.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   - Okay.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.600]   - I was, I didn't turn 18 until right when I graduated.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.800]   So I was kind of a little bit young for my grade,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.240]   even though it was still the correct,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.520]   correct position for me to be in.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.480]   And so I did a post-grad year in New Hampshire
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.160]   where I got stronger, got my knee healthy again
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.920]   and really got my, my bounce back.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.440]   And then came back to play in Mizzou in the fall of '99.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.760]   And that was when there was a change in coaching.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   And we went, Quinn Snyder was hired.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.560]   And so yeah, Quinn, he was, and he's still coaching
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.800]   and having a great career coaching in the NBA today.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.760]   And he, I learned so much from being around him
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.480]   and around the program.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.920]   We had some, we had a little bit of success
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.440]   and I started the first half of my junior and senior years,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.680]   but there was always, you know,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.320]   more talented guys behind me.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.160]   - Who was on that team?
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.560]   I'm trying to think.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   - My junior year, excuse me, my red shirt sophomore year,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.280]   we made the Elite Eight.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   We lost to Oklahoma.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.040]   That was as far as we made in the tournament.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.000]   I thought we were going to beat them,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.800]   but they had, they had a really good team, Hollis Price.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.200]   And then when I'm on our squad,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.520]   that was Kareem Rush, Clarence Gilbert,
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.180]   Arthur Johnson, Ricky Paulding.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.560]   And then my later years, my junior year,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.720]   I started half the year and then got beat out rightfully so
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.320]   by a guy named Jimmy McKinney from St. Louis, great player.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.480]   And then my senior year,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.200]   we had another young two guard named Thomas Gardner,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   played in the pros for a year or two.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.520]   But by the end of my senior year,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.960]   I could, my knees were really hurting.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.320]   I had another surgery on my right knee.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.040]   And so I was just kind of,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.120]   I was in a state of flux where I loved the game,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.360]   but, you know, being so committed at the collegiate level,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.400]   I didn't have the opportunity to really do a lot
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.240]   in the summer times,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.720]   like from a professional standpoint
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.440]   and thinking about the rest of life.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.280]   And so I had a couple offers to play in Europe,
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.640]   but I passed them up and got into the real world,
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.480]   so to speak.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.400]   And it's been fun.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.180]   I did an internship right out of school
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.760]   with the NBA league office.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.620]   And that was eye opening on a lot of levels
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.560]   because it shows you how the league operates
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.300]   and how, you know, I mean,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.040]   how big of a business it really is.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.140]   You know, when you're at the league level,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.760]   you're not dealing at the team level.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.080]   It's all business all the time.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.160]   It was also very humbling
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.800]   because I was in the player programs department
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.240]   and under the, Chris Achin, who I'm sure you know as well.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.400]   She was at the league at the time.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.720]   Chris is a wonderful, wonderful person.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.280]   And she taught me a lot while I was there.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   And she was, we, our group was in charge
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.360]   of the rookie transition program.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.200]   - Okay, yeah. - And so.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.720]   - Yeah, out in New York, right?
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.040]   - Yep, yep.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.160]   And so the rookie transition program kind of is,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.560]   you know, for those that might not be familiar with it,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.200]   is a, you know, kind of a crash course
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.220]   in how to be an adult.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.540]   That's just, you know, for better or worse.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.580]   And I went from competing against all those guys
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.300]   about three months prior.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.140]   - Yeah.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.000]   - And then now I was the one making copies
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   and making sure everybody was on time.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.500]   And I would see these guys and have to say hello.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.340]   And they knew who I was
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.540]   'cause we competed against each other,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.660]   but I was completely on the other side of it.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.500]   - Yeah.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.100]   - And so that was, it was very humbling right away.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.940]   But you could see, you know, the growth
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.420]   that really took place in myself
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.060]   over those few years in New York.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.720]   I did the internship for about six months.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.580]   Then I was unemployed for two months in New York,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.740]   which was probably the most fun two months of my life.
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.460]   (both laughing)
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.300]   - Unemployed.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.140]   - Yeah.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.300]   (both laughing)
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.820]   But then after that, I worked for an investment bank
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.780]   called Lehman Brothers.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   They're no longer a firm anymore.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   They went under during the crash of late 2007, '08, '09.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.820]   And it was a great experience.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.860]   I learned how to, you know, look at certain deals
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.940]   from a financial perspective.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.900]   Really taught me how to value,
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.560]   or the backbone of kind of our family business
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.620]   outside of sports is real estate, commercial real estate.
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.420]   And so I was a commercial real estate underwriter
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.540]   in their finance group for a few years.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.460]   And I learned so much,
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.740]   but I think as much as it's important
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.140]   to learn what you love to do,
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.700]   it's also important what you love not to do.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.480]   And so I knew that I really wanted to be more involved.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.380]   If I was ever gonna be involved in sports,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.740]   be more involved at the team level.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.340]   Thought I would find that much more rewarding.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.320]   And from a family business overall perspective,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.020]   I really learned how to look at a deal from,
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.840]   a real estate deal from the other side of it,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.680]   from the financial banking side,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.100]   as opposed to the development side.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.980]   And I think that's helped me to this day.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.460]   Helped me understand kind of things
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.240]   that we're doing across our venues.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.100]   You know, when you're trying to redevelop something
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.300]   in or around our venues, our arenas with our teams,
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.580]   and then our shopping centers
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.840]   that we have around the country as well.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.600]   So it was a great experience.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.220]   I moved to Denver in 2007.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.760]   Started watching tape with the Nuggets coaches
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.180]   and never looked back.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.020]   - Real quick.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.840]   Did you hear what happened to me
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.740]   at the rookie transition camp in New York?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.380]   Was this the one where you posted Adam Silver's number?
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.620]   (laughing)
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.060]   So, I mean, I didn't know that you knew
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.340]   what rookie transition even was, man.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.640]   We're sitting there like, you know, in the classroom,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.120]   learning about something.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.660]   And they have this slide show or whatever.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.220]   And I just take a picture of the room
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.780]   on Snapchat or whatever.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.580]   But like, his number is posted on the screen.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.420]   - On the screen.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.260]   (laughing)
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.140]   - And like, I didn't even realize I posted it,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.060]   but I look on my Snapchat 10 minutes later,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.660]   and my sister replied to it and was like,
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.660]   you know you just put Adam Silver's number out there.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.060]   So I look at the post and it already had
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.180]   like a thousand screenshots.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.020]   (laughing)
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.380]   And then like, literally like 10 minutes later,
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.740]   they put it out on, they put it on the screen
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.820]   in the classroom.
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.700]   And they were like, basically,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.260]   I thought I was gonna get kicked out the league.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.100]   - Oh wow.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.920]   - It was like a big deal.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.340]   And like, I ended up having to get up on stage
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.820]   and apologize in front of everybody.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.540]   They were like, the way they worded it though,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.740]   they were like, yes, someone in this room
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.420]   leaked Adam Silver's number.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.020]   They're gonna come up here and apologize.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.700]   So everyone around the class is looking around
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.820]   and I have to stand up, get up on the stage,
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.660]   and apologize.
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.480]   - Did they tell you in advance
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.320]   they were gonna have you do it?
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.260]   - Like, they brought me in the back room
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.300]   with like Adam Silver's like,
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.500]   and they were like, what were you doing?
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.460]   I was like, it was an honest accident, I'm sorry.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.580]   I can get up on stage and apologize if you guys want to.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.820]   They were like, yeah, we're gonna have you do that.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.340]   So it was like a whole situation,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.280]   but that's funny that you were out in New York
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.380]   for a few years.
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.620]   - It was good, it was a good time.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.700]   And I did see that, but.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.420]   - It was crazy.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.340]   But yeah, so you go through college,
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.140]   you go through that internship and everything like that,
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.280]   and then you realize you want to be a part
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.660]   of the business world.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.080]   When did you and your father and your family in general
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.800]   decide you wanted to start owning teams?
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:12.060]   - For my father, it goes back to kind of a dream
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.820]   that he's had for a very long time.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.420]   I think that, and he's a huge sports fan in general,
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.680]   I think my family, we love sports.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.100]   I was always taught to kind of,
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.660]   both by my dad and my mom,
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.540]   use sports as a metaphor for life.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.540]   There's teamwork, sacrifice, understanding
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.960]   how you can help others.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.460]   And so for me, I guess, I'm rambling a little bit,
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.060]   what was your original question?
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.100]   'Cause I was gonna go down one way,
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.940]   I don't wanna make sure I answered the question.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.340]   - No, I mean, yeah, we're just talking a little bit more,
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.740]   just like how did you get into that?
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.080]   - Yeah, so like, it was my dad's dream kind of way back when
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.480]   and I guess I would say that as a real estate developer,
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.720]   he was always looking for a potential deal.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   And the first deal that ever kind of came around
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   was when the NFL was expanding in 1993, '94 maybe, '92.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.440]   And that was, the NFL was expanding
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.520]   and they were gonna award two new teams to two cities.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.880]   And so St. Louis wanted to be on the ticket
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.700]   and my dad partnered with some guys locally,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.500]   they reached out to him and unfortunately,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.960]   it didn't result in an expansion franchise.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.160]   But when that didn't work out,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.500]   he helped position another group of people
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.780]   to come to St. Louis and that resulted in the Rams moving.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.780]   And then from there, it became a really,
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.380]   just a minority investment in an NFL team
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.520]   that morphed into, he was looking around for,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   like I said, as a real estate developer,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.580]   potentially a deal that involved a stadium venue
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.960]   and teams as well.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.760]   And he looked around, I think there was a few opportunities
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.320]   and then all of a sudden the Denver deal presented itself.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.060]   And so when you have a real estate developer
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.720]   that can make sense of a real estate deal
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.780]   that involves two sports teams,
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.600]   that was kind of how we, what I say is,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.300]   we were a real estate family that kind of fell into sports
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.140]   due to our love with it,
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.900]   because that was the Avalanche Nuggets
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.800]   and at the time was called Pepsi Center,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.940]   which is now Ball Arena.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:20.860]   - Right.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.640]   - And then that has morphed into what we have now,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.720]   which is SoFi Stadium and the LA Rams.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.160]   We have Ball Arena, the teams in Avalanche Nuggets
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   and also the Colorado Mammoth.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.400]   We have Dick's Sporting Goods Park,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.640]   which is where Colorado Rapids play in Denver.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.760]   And then the other one, which is the really big one,
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.640]   is over in London.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.520]   We have Arsenal Football Club.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.360]   - Got you.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.180]   - Yeah.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.120]   - As a team owner and it's been a long time coming
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.240]   and there's been a lot of recent success of your teams,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.400]   championships with us, the Avs, the Rams,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.700]   which has to make you guys,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.160]   definitely in the most recent years,
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.600]   some of the most successful team owners in the history,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   but during that long process of developing the teams,
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   drafting players,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.960]   was there ever thought of letting some of these things go
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.280]   or you guys have been committed from the jump
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.360]   with all these teams?
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.360]   - We've been pretty committed.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.160]   We're long-term holders in really everything that we do.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.680]   My father's philosophy,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.780]   and I know that's one I'll carry forward with me as well,
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.800]   is whenever you invest in something,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.880]   if you're looking to make a short buck on it
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.080]   or try to figure out a way to make an exit somewhere,
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.440]   that's usually not our strategy.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.940]   I know there's some brilliant people out there
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.420]   that can make sense of deals like that,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.560]   but we're always, we wanna invest in something
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.600]   that makes sense for us over the long term.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.360]   And so, when he did the Denver deal in 2000,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.160]   I was still in school, I was at Mizzou.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.240]   I remember him telling me about it
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.320]   and me just being incredibly excited.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.400]   But then they set out and they built
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.120]   kind of the first version of the Nuggets
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.960]   underneath kind of our family.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.140]   And that resulted in some really amazing teams.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.880]   They hadn't made the playoffs in I don't know how long,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.260]   but they kind of stripped the roster down
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.120]   over the first year,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   drafted Carmelo Anthony in the summer of 2003,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.440]   and then they started signing free agents.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.440]   And by the spring of 2004, they were in the playoffs,
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.160]   I think for nine or 10 straight years.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.040]   And that was a level of success
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   that the Nuggets hadn't quite had.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.140]   And then, when my dad and I kind of really sat down
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.920]   to talk about the future
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.360]   of how we could build the Nuggets back,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.160]   I knew that, I had some philosophy.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.120]   I'd been around the team for probably four or five years
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   at that point in time.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.720]   And I'd watched a lot of basketball
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.960]   and kind of tried to devise some sort of strategy.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.760]   I was like, it's never been done in Denver.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.020]   We've never won the whole thing.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.480]   How can we actually do this?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.400]   And for me, the only advantage that we could really create
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.840]   was to kind of elongate our timeline.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.840]   And so, draft really good players
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.020]   that are also really good people,
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.120]   surround them with really good coaching,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.220]   and try to grow something organically over time.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.600]   And it's never gonna be perfect.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.400]   Progress is never linear, as you know.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.360]   I mean, our squad was up and down those first few years.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.480]   You guys were all kind of learning different things,
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.980]   the different roles.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.480]   And now, all of a sudden, you see it start to gel.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.600]   And then, you guys get hit with injuries.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.720]   And so, it required a certain amount of patience,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.240]   but also knowing that, at the end of the day,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.880]   we had really good people.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.600]   And that's why we're really proud of you guys as players.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.360]   But I think that the group of people that we have down there
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.680]   is really unique around the NBA and how you guys all
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.280]   play for each other.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.020]   Our culture has kind of evolved to a place
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.400]   where I couldn't be prouder of it.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.900]   And then, the icing on the cake was
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.720]   to finally win the championship last year.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.600]   But it all started kind of watching--
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.960]   we had a 57-win team in 2012, 2013.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.040]   And we won 57 games and didn't have an All-Star.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.240]   And that's pretty hard to do in the NBA.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.880]   But I would watch that team.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.000]   And I remember watching us down in Miami.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.800]   And we played the Heat toe-to-toe for about 46
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.040]   minutes.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.960]   And then, they could go to a level
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.560]   and close those games out that we just didn't quite have.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.320]   And so, I was like, OK, if we're going
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.240]   to take this step backwards, and we're
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.100]   going to finally come back to the playoffs one day,
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.840]   we're going to come back with a team that's
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.440]   built to be sustainable and continually
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.280]   grow our ceiling organically.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.760]   And that's what you guys did, man.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.640]   You guys all worked your butts off.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.800]   You guys all figured out how to come together.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.200]   I remember I wasn't in the bubble,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   but watching you guys kind of--
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.920]   I think in the bubble, there was a new level of confidence
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.840]   that was reached.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.280]   I saw you stepping up in new ways,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.880]   Yoke and Jamal doing their thing.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.560]   And it really kind of was a--
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.160]   I was watching on television going,
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.040]   this group can really do something special.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.800]   And so, that was the first time where I really was like, OK,
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.400]   now how can we start to go for this?
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.740]   And then, the patients that I talked about,
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.660]   we come out of the bubble, we kind of hit the ground running.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.760]   But we had lost Jeremy in free agency.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.220]   And it took a little while for us
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.480]   to figure out how we wanted to try to fill that void.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.520]   And then, when Aaron came along, we
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.160]   jumped at that opportunity to get AG in the squad.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.040]   And then, I think we ran off, I don't
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.540]   know what we were those 10 games after we traded for Aaron,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.280]   but we were like 9 and 1 or something like that.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.000]   It was before Jamal got hurt.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.960]   And it was like, I don't think we lost a game.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.000]   Yeah, we were something like that.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.200]   We were 8 and 2, 9 and 1.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.280]   But we were beating good teams and beating them pretty handily.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.880]   And then, Jamal went down.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.480]   And you can't-- and I think that while we knew it internally
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.520]   at the time, maybe the rest of the league didn't,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   we couldn't replace Jamal with anybody.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.320]   There was a level of skill and a level of chemistry
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.240]   that we knew we just had to sit tight.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.520]   And then, the following fall, I mean,
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.200]   you had to go through another adventure again.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.840]   And I mean, it's amazing to think how far the group has
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.960]   come and how far certain individuals have come, man.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.640]   And I'm sure you look back on things at different times.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.160]   And it's amazing to think how far we've come
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.520]   and how far we can still go.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.040]   No, that's crazy.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.720]   Yeah, I saw some post or whatever.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.000]   It was talking about the individual stories
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   of all the guys on our team and how it really
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.040]   was grown organically.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.600]   When did you realize we had something special with Nicola?
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.720]   Did you know that early on?
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.200]   I know Nerkich was here at the time.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.600]   Yeah, that was-- it's a funny story about Nicola.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.160]   And if anybody tells you they knew,
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.240]   they are lying through their teeth.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.960]   I didn't know.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.360]   The first year I got drafted, I went to training camp.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.600]   And I had no idea.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.000]   Like, just because he treats a game different than practice.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.160]   So I'm seeing Mason Plumlee and Nicola go at it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.400]   I'm like, wait, why does Nicola start over Mason?
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.320]   Like, I remember that was my thought process.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.560]   So yeah, yeah, tell me that story.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.120]   How did you--
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.320]   So yeah, Yoke is a funny story.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.520]   I remember sitting with our former president of basketball
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.140]   ops and GM at the time, Tim Connolly and Arturis Karnashovas.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.760]   One of them now runs the Timberwolves.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.560]   One of them now runs the Chicago Bulls.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.880]   But they were in our front office at the time.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.460]   And they're like, hey, there's this guy
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.880]   that you should see on tape because we want him
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.480]   to keep his name in the draft.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   But he wants to stay over in Europe for one more year.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.440]   And we're in a phase at the time where
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.880]   we wanted as many young players as we could get
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.120]   and to try to see what we could grow.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.820]   And so I was actually like, why does he
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.780]   want to stay over in Europe one more year?
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.640]   And both Tim and Arturis were like, it's
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.840]   best for his development.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.720]   And we think that there's a skill level there
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.280]   that could be interesting.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.240]   But I remember them showing me on tape.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.280]   And Nicola's wearing like this--
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.320]   their colors were like pink and blue.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.160]   And Nicola couldn't jump over a phone book.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.400]   But he'd catch these balls.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.600]   And he'd throw these passes.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.400]   And you're like, I don't know how that's going to translate.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   But that player's basketball IQ is obviously off the charts.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.800]   And so we drafted him.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.160]   He stayed over for one more year.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.360]   And then he came over in the summer of 2015.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.640]   And my dad actually has really good stories
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.600]   about being down in the weight room early
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.720]   in the morning that summer.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.520]   And Nicola would be in there every morning
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.760]   with his two brothers.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.720]   And they'd be beating on him before the coaches would even
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.200]   come in.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.060]   And he'd be in there.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.240]   But over time, I think Nicola cleaned up his diet.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.440]   He understood what it took to be a professional.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.640]   And you referenced Yusef Nerkic, who
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   was another really good young player that we
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.680]   had on our roster at the time.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.600]   And we couldn't quite tell what to do with both of them.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.640]   Because Yusef, I think, had made second team all-rookie.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.800]   And Nicola was coming over.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.760]   And so we had a very established center.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.200]   But we knew that they both had really good hands, really
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.400]   good skills.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.480]   And the thing that was unfortunate
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.100]   is the league was trending-- that
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.240]   was when the Warriors were on their ascension.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.160]   And the league was trending to this small ball,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.760]   shooting everywhere.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.240]   And even more extreme than it is now, almost.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.840]   It was like everyone wanted to try to be the Warriors almost
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.960]   overnight.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.840]   And you couldn't play Nicola and Yusef together.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.200]   You had two seven-footers that were incredibly skilled
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.000]   and very unselfish guys.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.640]   But trying to play them together,
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.040]   while it did present its advantages at certain points,
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.440]   it was tough for them to cover whenever
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.280]   you got almost four guards out there moving around in sync.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.720]   And it's a tough defensive cover.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.920]   So we had to really put our heads together
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.960]   on what we wanted to do.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   And fortunately, by the time-- after Nicola's first season,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.560]   I think he made first team all-rookie.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.680]   And then we were halfway into the second year.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.880]   And we were really realizing that we couldn't-- we
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.280]   had to pick-- we had to choose.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.120]   Because they're both starting-level centers.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.200]   And I think Yusef's contract was coming up in about a year.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.800]   And so we were having our analytics group
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.640]   run all the different numbers of how to compare the two
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.640]   and what to look for.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.560]   And all of a sudden, this comparison comes through.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.720]   And fortunately, we had enough data at the time
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.240]   to be able to really put together per 36 minutes
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.640]   and compare different things.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.080]   And so this comparison comes through.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.840]   And it's player A and player B. And it
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.960]   was during their second season.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.120]   And the only difference of the two
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.600]   is that player A is two years older than player
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.880]   B at the time of their second year in the NBA.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.280]   Player A just entered the league later.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.800]   And you could clearly see that player B's numbers were better
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.700]   in really every category.
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.840]   And so I was like, OK.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.240]   I was like, I'm going to guess that player B is Nicola.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.880]   And they're like, yep, you're right.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.760]   Player B is Nicola.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.360]   And I'm like, all right.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   Well, then who are we talking about with player A?
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.900]   Is this some sort of comparison with Nurk?
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.400]   Or is this some sort of comparison
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.280]   with someone else in the league?
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.440]   And they're like, player A is Larry Bird.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.000]   And I was like, oh.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.560]   Like, you looked at the per 36?
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.560]   Wow.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.360]   And so that was when I think all of us
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.880]   kind of looked at each other.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.080]   Because sometimes when you talk to a basketball purist,
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.040]   even, to your point, Nicola, his skill set and the way
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.200]   that he plays, the eye test, he doesn't jump out at you
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   right away.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.000]   But when you watch it over time and you
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.480]   understand what he's doing and how he's affecting a game,
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   it really jumps out at you.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.160]   And so that was when-- and that was in-- that
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.160]   was like the first week of December.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.360]   And I think we were on like a four or five game
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.080]   skit at the time.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.400]   And then Tim and I wound up on the phone.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.520]   I was like, Tim, I'm never going to tell anyone who to play,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.600]   any coach what to do.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.440]   But if we're going to pick one, tell them to put Nicola in.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.400]   And we got to roll with it.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.240]   And then that was the famous-- the next night
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.520]   or the night after was-- the date was that December
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.480]   something when-- that was when Yoke went into the starting
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.880]   lineup and never came out.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.720]   Never looked back.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.880]   And it's crazy, because--
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.360]   It was in Dallas, I think, yeah.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.640]   Yeah, I have unlimited Nicola stories, too.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.880]   You talk about the cleaning up the diet and stuff.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.320]   My first couple years, I mean, he cared about basketball.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.520]   But he would go home to Serbia in the summer
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.840]   and come back out of shape.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.920]   I've seen him progress every year.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.280]   Even from MVP year to MVP year, he's somehow progressing.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.640]   So you guys obviously made the right choice, man.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.760]   There's a lot of talk about his number, number 15,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.720]   and him and Carmelo Anthony.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.140]   I don't even know the whole story of what came out.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.140]   But yeah, talk a little bit about your thoughts
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.480]   on that whole situation.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.840]   Yeah, that's a funny one.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.760]   I saw Melo was on something fairly recently.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.400]   And my first-- it's interesting to think back,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.040]   because my first meeting when I was
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   put in charge of the Nuggets in the summer of 2010
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.120]   was to fly to Baltimore and sit in a hotel room
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.660]   where it was he, his agent, and one other guy that
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.320]   worked with him.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.000]   And he asked to be traded.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.080]   And they gave us two teams.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   And I put that in my back pocket, went back to Denver.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.840]   I was kind of-- our front office was in flux at the time.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.540]   And then I wound up hiring a guy named Masai Ujiri,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.960]   now runs the Toronto Raptors.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.840]   And then he and I and another person named Pete D'Alessandro
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.580]   worked on that trade for about six months.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.760]   And so we got through the trade.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.280]   And you don't really think about much.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.600]   We had Allen Iverson for a number of years.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.280]   And Ty Lawson wore number three.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.200]   And so it's not anything that really ever crossed our mind.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.960]   And so I was very surprised to hear
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.440]   Carmelo say that the other day, because it wasn't something
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.520]   that ever crossed my mind.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.600]   I think Nicola has worn number 15 his entire career,
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.520]   even when he was over in Europe.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.600]   And so it wasn't something that really crossed our mind.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.560]   And to have Nicola, I think, ascend to the level
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.120]   that he's at, maybe that might get under somebody's skin,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:10.920]   I guess, perhaps.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.720]   But I don't know.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.520]   I think Nicola's always worn 15.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.800]   It was never anything that we ever thought about.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:20.600]   And I'm just happy that Nicola's on our team.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.560]   What specifically was Melo upset about?
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.920]   Was it that someone else got to wear his number?
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.720]   His number didn't get retired?
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.880]   I'm not 100% sure.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.200]   I think Melo, he had an unbelievable career with us.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.800]   He really put the Nuggets back on the map in a really positive
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   way.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.120]   I think that there was--
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.160]   it's interesting when a player wants to be traded from a team.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.520]   And that creates certain feelings.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.640]   It took a while for our fan base in Denver
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.960]   to get over that as well.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   It was an interesting scenario, because that whole saga really
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.520]   started the summer before, the summer of 2010.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.640]   That was when LeBron had left Miami--
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.160]   or excuse me, left Cleveland to go to Miami.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.120]   And so player empowerment and movement
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.360]   was really just starting to reach its peak.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.720]   And I think that's great.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.800]   I think you guys have one shot at your careers.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.760]   We're kind of custodians of that career.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.800]   We obviously have our own goals in trying to build our teams.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.720]   But I always respect if somebody wants to go do something else.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.000]   But for the city of Denver, I think
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.320]   they took it very personally.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.360]   And that took a little time for the city to get over.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.160]   And I'm sure Melo didn't like being booed for the first few
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.680]   times he came back, because he did.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.180]   He worked his butt off for the city.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.800]   And we had a great run in there.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.840]   We made the Western Conference Finals in 2009.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.800]   That was the only time we made it out of the first round.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.280]   But I think over time, hopefully, the feelings
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:48.800]   dissipate.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.660]   I think if he was to come back to Denver,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.200]   I think he'd probably get a different reception these days.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.640]   But from a personal level, there was never
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.480]   any animosity or anything on our thinking about Nicola's number,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.880]   because it was just the number that he wanted to wear
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.680]   and the number that he's worn forever.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.280]   I think that it's been interesting to see
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.640]   his ascension to where he is.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   But for anyone to think that we gave a second round
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.080]   pick number 15, and knowing that it would someday turn into this,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.920]   I think that's a pretty wild statement.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.200]   Multiple times.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.000]   That's funny, man.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.800]   Well, you guys have done an incredible job.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.340]   I want to talk a little bit about your guys' thought
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.440]   process with me coming into the league.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.560]   Obviously, you were both from Columbia,
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.000]   so you had known about me, things like that.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.560]   But I've been through a lot.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.840]   The Clippers doctor spread the report throughout the league
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.920]   that they didn't know.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.200]   They weren't sure if I'd be able to play basketball,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.480]   considering my injuries.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   And a lot of teams were scared away by that.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.900]   I remember the first time I got on the phone with the Nuggets
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.120]   was with Tim Conley on the day of the draft,
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.240]   because my agent wanted to create a floor.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.040]   Like, OK, if he drops it here, this team will take him.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.640]   So I had no idea going into the draft what was going to happen.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:09.240]   What were those conversations like behind doors about me?
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.160]   Well, my Michael Porter Jr. story first starts--
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.240]   I think you were in seventh or eighth grade.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.680]   A friend of mine sent me this link
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   of some unknown skinny kid going up for a dunk.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.240]   And I was like, wow.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.360]   I was like, this kid's supposedly the best eighth
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.280]   grader in the country.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.120]   And I was like, wow.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.360]   I was like, I've never seen an eighth grader put--
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.920]   like, look at the rim, almost, like you were.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.840]   And then I was like, wait a minute.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.520]   I'm like, that's Jeff City's gym.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.440]   That's Jefferson City.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.560]   I'm like, that's-- I know that gym.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.000]   We're my high school rivals.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.320]   And so I did a quick search to try to find out
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.960]   more of what I was watching.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.200]   And I was quickly told that Central Missouri
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.880]   had one of the best players in the country,
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.560]   because I was like, that section of the country
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.360]   doesn't produce talent like you.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.940]   And so I was very aware of who you were from an early age.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.440]   And I followed your career because I
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.120]   was kind of proud that we had someone of your caliber
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.960]   coming out of that section of the state.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:16.680]   And so I followed your career.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.400]   And then I was going to watch your first game at Mizzou.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   And then I heard about what had happened.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.000]   And I think you were going through warm-ups, right?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.760]   There was a couple of days leading up to it
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.840]   where you had some tightness, right?
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.720]   Yeah, the injury.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.280]   Yeah, it happened a few days prior.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.480]   But that was my first time experiencing anything
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.400]   strange, so I thought it would just dissipate.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.120]   And it got worse.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.720]   And the first game comes around.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.460]   Yeah, and you were going through warm-ups.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.320]   And then I think you had to play, what,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.760]   the first 10 seconds before they--
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.360]   It was so close to game time.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.760]   They'd already turned in the lineup, right?
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   It was so close to game time.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.260]   They had already put the lineup up.
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.520]   So I go to my dad.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.760]   And I'm like, dad, I don't think I can play.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.520]   Like, I don't know what's going on, but I can't jump right.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.120]   Like, I can't produce force like I want to.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.840]   And then we went to the coaches.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.180]   And they were like, OK, you just have to start the game.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.600]   Because big national TV game, number one player
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.520]   in the country going to the University of Missouri,
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.440]   which never happens.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.240]   And then so, yeah, I had to play the first 10 seconds.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:07.800]   It came out.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.760]   Yep.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.360]   And then I followed what was going on.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.840]   And I knew you came.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.160]   You were really rushing to get back because you
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.720]   wanted to help your team.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.560]   And that told me a lot about your character.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.840]   If you were already thinking about the pros, which
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.280]   is a natural thing, I think that there's probably
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.560]   part of you that wants to think ultra long-term
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.320]   in that scenario.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.440]   And I'm sure there was people around you.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.520]   But it also told me that there was a person inside of you,
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.000]   inside of that player, that was really competitive,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.240]   that wanted to get out there.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.080]   And you wanted to help your teammates.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.200]   And so as I watched that spring kind of evolve,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.080]   and I heard about your draft workouts,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.400]   leading into that week, I thought your floor
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.120]   in the draft, I think Chicago had seven.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   And seven or eight.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.560]   But I also knew that when you were healthy,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.600]   you were probably the best, if not one of the top two
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.280]   or three players in that draft.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.360]   And we had just missed the playoffs by one game that year.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.480]   And we were thinking that once we made it back to the playoffs,
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   we knew we weren't going backwards.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.640]   We had a good young team.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.720]   And we just had a few things that we
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.000]   needed, we thought, to really put us in a new level.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.400]   And so the day of the draft, I remember coming over
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.200]   and Tim had called me the night before the draft.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.920]   And he goes, hey, I'm just going to put something on your radar.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.400]   I was like, what's up?
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.800]   Because by missing the playoffs by one game,
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.880]   we picked 14 in the lottery.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.280]   And so Tim called me.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.520]   He's like, hey, I want to put something on your radar.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   And I'm like, what's up?
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.720]   And he goes, I heard something from a buddy of mine
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.840]   that Chicago might pass.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.640]   And I'm like, I thought you told me earlier today that that
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.200]   was Michael's floor.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.360]   And he goes, I don't know.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   He goes, I don't know what happened.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.840]   I'm still trying to gather the information.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.540]   I'll talk to you about it in the morning.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.200]   And I said, OK.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.480]   And so I came in the day of the draft.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   And Tim Arturas and I sit down.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.560]   And they said that you may have had a spasm or something,
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.120]   like at a workout, and it might have scared a few teams.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.880]   And I was like, really?
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.280]   I was like, this is just-- can we get more data on it?
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.840]   Is there any kind of-- and they're like,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.500]   we're still trying to piece it together.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.840]   But he could fall.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.320]   And I was like, what do you mean he could fall?
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.260]   And I was like, guys, I'm like, that skill set
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.400]   does not grow on trees.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.200]   I was like, what do you mean he could fall?
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.800]   And they're like, well, teams could get scared of the back.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.560]   And I said, OK.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.440]   And so then I rang my dad.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.840]   And he came down that afternoon.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.040]   And then the four of us, Arturas, Tim, myself, my dad,
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.620]   and we pulled Coach Malone in as well.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.280]   And we said, look, if he's there, we're going to take him.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.040]   And we got all our doctors in.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.400]   And it was a really great group experience,
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.200]   because we all had to put our heads together
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.600]   from our own perspective.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.760]   Tim and Arturas knew that they believed in your skill set
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.320]   and your talent.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.700]   And then you had Coach Malone, who
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.400]   was understanding that this is something
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.640]   that was going to play out over multiple years,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.780]   whereas a lot of coaches--
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.280]   and this is their job.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.040]   Coaches have one responsibility.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.680]   That's win the next game.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.480]   And so you have to put-- and then our perspective
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.200]   is even further.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.640]   It's how can we create the best talent over time?
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.960]   And so when your name was still there,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.440]   it was a no-brainer for us.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.200]   It might sound funny to some people,
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.320]   but I was really worried that the--
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.680]   you referenced a team that had two picks ahead of us.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.480]   And I thought somebody might take a chance.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:38.820]   Somebody's got to take a chance.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:42.680]   I think they may have, if it wasn't for their doctor that
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.360]   was doing the main analysis on me that day.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.680]   And so our decision in the room that day,
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.640]   when we all kind of walked out after discussing
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.520]   the different concerns and thoughts from all
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.440]   of our own perspectives, was we'll never
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.180]   have a chance to draft another player like you,
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.560]   especially at that point in time with the group of players
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.120]   that we had, the skill set that you brought.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.880]   And you could raise our ceiling immensely.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.800]   But we knew it wasn't going to be right away.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.600]   And so we had to--
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.160]   once we drafted you, we got you in.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.800]   We let our doctors take a look at you.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.280]   We made sure that you felt like one of the family.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.120]   And we knew that there was going to be a long journey ahead.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.160]   And I think you may have known.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.280]   But looking back, you maybe didn't even
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.360]   realize what you were going to have to go through.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.180]   And so you had another surgery.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.960]   We sat you out that whole first year.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.800]   We tried to make you feel like you were part of the group.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.680]   Hopefully, you did, even though you weren't getting to play.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.520]   But I remember coming over to training camp that first year
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.240]   when-- I don't even think you could play.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.160]   All you could do is just do standstill shooting.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.440]   And our shooting coach at the time was--
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.480]   was it Mark Price?
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.000]   Mark Price.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.880]   Yeah, Mark Price.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.320]   See, I remember.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.860]   And Mark and I were standing there.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.160]   And I was like, Mark, what do you think of our group?
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.280]   And he goes, wow, there's some really good young players.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.480]   And that was when he started to ask about Nicola.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.360]   And Nicola was just starting to really show the level
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.120]   that he could dominate.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.520]   And I was like, what do you think?
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.360]   And he goes, I think you've got a really great, great group
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.440]   here.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.280]   He goes, but I'll tell you what.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.800]   He goes, the best shooter in this gym can't play right now.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.280]   And I was like, you're talking about Michael, right?
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.200]   And he goes, yep.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.660]   He goes, I'm talking about Michael.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.320]   He goes, just take your time with him.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.120]   Be patient.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.000]   But he goes, that guy's the best shooter in this gym.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.280]   And I said, well, that's our plan.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.720]   And so over the course of that year--
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.440]   and then I think your first full season was the COVID year,
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.180]   right?
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.080]   Yeah, my first full season was the first half of the season.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.320]   And then we go to the bubble.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.400]   Yeah, my first full season.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.440]   So I saw an important step out of you,
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.880]   which was over the first, I don't know,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.640]   six months of the season, I think
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.680]   you were up and down as any rookie is going to be.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.840]   You're learning how to play.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   You're learning where you fit in the different roles.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.920]   And you're learning how to play with some
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.520]   of these guys around you.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.720]   And then the season stops, like right around this time
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.560]   four years ago.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.760]   COVID hits.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.480]   We go into our cocoons.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.880]   And then we emerge in the bubble a few months later.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:20.080]   And you went from a rookie to a second-year player
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.560]   in that little two-month span.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.700]   In that gap, yeah.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.800]   And so when you came into that bubble,
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.200]   I saw a different Michael.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.680]   I saw a more confident Michael.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.240]   I saw one that knew how to fit within our team,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.120]   but also went to really use your own skill set to drive us
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.840]   forward.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.400]   And I remember you hitting some big shots in the bubble
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.920]   and seeing our team really start to believe in each other.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.160]   And I'm getting goosebumps thinking about it.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.880]   That's crazy.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.400]   But then you come out of that.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.960]   It's kind of a very short offseason.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.600]   We lose Jeremy.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.120]   We replace him with Aaron.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.320]   And then Jamal gets hurt.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.800]   And so I knew there was a special group in there.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.520]   And then you have to wait almost two years.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.920]   And that required a lot of patience on our end.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.080]   And we never even remotely thought
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.960]   about veering off the path of the roster that we had.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.040]   And now that we got everybody healthy,
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.760]   I could see that you guys last fall,
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.640]   there was a little bit of a period where you kind of had
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.960]   to play your way into it again.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.640]   Jamal had to play his way into it again,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   gain that confidence in your body.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.520]   And then by March, I could tell we were locked in
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.400]   and that we were just ready for the playoffs.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.240]   And then it was like, OK, let's be healthy come April
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.400]   and see where the chips fall.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.740]   And I was really proud of the way
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.800]   that you guys just immediately locked in
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.040]   to go 16-4 against the NBA's best shot.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:45.880]   That's not something that a lot of people can say.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:50.120]   Well, man, I mean, man to man, I appreciate you guys so much
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   taking the chance on me.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.920]   Appreciate you, man.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.520]   I remember I said at draft night I
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.760]   was going to do whatever I could to be one of the best draft
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.880]   picks that you guys could ever draft.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.920]   And still, I've been through a lot.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.940]   But like you saw at Mizzou, giving up and giving
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.720]   into whatever injuries, that's not part of my DNA.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.680]   But I'm so happy to be a nugget, you know what I mean?
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.160]   People ask me all the time about that whole draft situation.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.320]   And I'm like, God does work in mysterious ways
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.200]   because it's a blessing that somehow I fell to 14
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.160]   to a team that was already winning.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.640]   So I got to take my time and not rush back after the injury.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.000]   And now we've just built this program, this championship
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.280]   level program from really the ground up
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.440]   with adding small pieces.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.480]   And we got it continued rolling with the young guys.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.400]   We got now Peyton, CB.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.980]   I know Julian's not playing right now,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:44.640]   but Julian, some of the guards we got.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.680]   So it's pretty crazy.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.160]   So you go through all this stuff, the ups and downs
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.120]   as an owner, and then you win the championship.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.340]   How fulfilling was that?
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.120]   I know you guys had already won the Rams championship, the Avs
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.480]   championship, but it probably felt a little bit different
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.000]   being a basketball player.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.680]   Yeah, I mean, I think I'm kidding myself
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:06.080]   if I try to say that it didn't.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.280]   But I think I'm most proud because while the Rams had
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.760]   won a championship 20 years ago in St. Louis,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.160]   the Avs had won twice before in Denver, but not since 2001.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.560]   The Nuggets had never won one.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.400]   They'd never even been to the NBA finals.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.520]   And so I got goosebumps walking around the arena
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.880]   just seeing the NBA finals logo for the first time.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:37.000]   But the process of going through it with the Rams, the Avalanche,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.680]   and in the middle of the Rams and the Avalanche winning
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.120]   in 2022, our major league lacrosse team
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.240]   won a championship as well.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:48.300]   And Arsenal has been knocking on the door of a few things.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.380]   We got a good young group.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.640]   We grew pretty organically over there as well.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.760]   So there's a formula to kind of what we try to do.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.160]   But the NBA one was very special for my dad and I,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.440]   mainly because it had never been done before.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.480]   And to be frank, we had a lot of people telling us
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.400]   that we couldn't do it.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.040]   When I made some changes to the Nuggets coaching staff
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.800]   and we started to kind of go through our building process,
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.320]   like I said, progress isn't linear.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.480]   And so I would go down, be around the court
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.840]   during games at times, and I'd have people screaming at me,
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.040]   what are you doing, you idiot?
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.920]   We just want to see a competitive team.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.120]   And we can't believe your dad trusts you
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.960]   with all this and everything.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   And so I heard it all.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.920]   But you stay the course.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.880]   You believe in kind of what you're doing.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.720]   And so when you finally do reach the pinnacle of it all
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.200]   and you realize that all those people that were doubting you
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.960]   are now supporting you, it's a great feeling.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.040]   But it was also--
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.640]   I didn't realize how rewarding I would find it
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.480]   as I'm walking down the street and someone grabs me
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.560]   and they're like, man, I've been a Nuggets fan since 1978.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.160]   I can die happy now.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.760]   And those little moments where you're like, wow,
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.880]   you didn't realize how much this was going to really touch people.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.080]   You get so locked in on trying to figure out a way to do it
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.800]   that you forget how many people that are along for the ride
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.360]   and really supporting you along the way.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.880]   And I've watched game five 50 times at this point,
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.680]   where you just start to count down.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.120]   And it never gets old, man.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.480]   And so the cool thing was, though,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:24.920]   was I knew on Monday afternoon that we wanted on a Monday.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.680]   And I knew on Monday afternoon, I was like, if I wake up
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.600]   tomorrow, I'll either be a champion or we're not,
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.800]   and I'm still going to be the same person.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.960]   And if we lose tonight, we're going to go down to Miami
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.520]   and try and do it again.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.080]   And if we win, I'll wake up a champion,
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.120]   but nothing's really going to change.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.600]   And we'll figure out a way to go try to do it again.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.880]   And so the perspective of having those other championships
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.760]   recently really keeps you humble.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.920]   You know you've really accomplished something great,
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.040]   but at the same time, when you do get that taste of success,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.520]   I think as a competitor, we all want more.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.120]   And that's the cool thing that I really see about you guys,
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   is I think that even though you accomplished something
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.360]   for the first time in all of your careers,
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.240]   I see a collective focus starting to form here
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.600]   as we're coming down the stretch.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.260]   And I mean, there's a lot of things that go into it.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.640]   And at the end of the day, I think
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.380]   that people need to understand, no matter
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.240]   how you build these teams and how you
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.680]   think you may have a chance, you need a little bit of luck
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.600]   involved.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.040]   We need to have our health.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   We need to have our group together.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.040]   And so you never know what could happen.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.520]   But I'm really proud of the group.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.780]   I'm really proud of the focus.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:35.240]   And if we're healthy, I think it will be a tough team
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.440]   to beat, which is always the goal.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.300]   Yeah, I think you said two really nuggets of wisdom.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.440]   First of all was throughout the whole process of life,
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.640]   and even as athletes, as competitors,
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   the joy you put on other people's face.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.600]   Something Nicola mentioned as well in the interview
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.400]   is those are the things that stick with you.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah, the championship is amazing.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.200]   But like you said, you wake up tomorrow
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.360]   and you're still the same person.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.120]   But it's those moments along the way.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.040]   I go to Taiwan this offseason, and they could not--
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.000]   it was diehard Nuggets fans in Taiwan
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.760]   that were talking about the championship.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.160]   So I think that's--
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.480]   You guys put yourselves on the map in a whole new way
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.720]   with, one, winning the championship.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.400]   But I think, two, how you guys all carry yourself.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.480]   That's what makes me just as proud as winning.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.860]   Because I think you guys, like I said,
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.360]   we play a brand of basketball that's really fun for people
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:29.960]   to watch.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.240]   And hopefully, at the youth level,
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.120]   you have a lot of coaches saying,
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.440]   you guys should play like them.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.320]   You know?
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.760]   You and your father and your family as a whole
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.840]   have built something incredible.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.360]   A lot of people think being financially stable or wealthy
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.120]   is the goal of life.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.580]   You guys right now could sell your teams.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.320]   You could take all the money and live perfectly comfortable
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.880]   the rest of your life, your kids, your kids' kids.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.640]   Why do you continue--
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.040]   after you reach the success that you have,
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.560]   why do you continue to grind and work so hard
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.640]   and fly to London and back and do all these things?
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.960]   Is it just-- because a lot of people
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.360]   truly think that happiness in life equals money.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.460]   But you guys could just go chill on the beach
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.420]   and do whatever you want the rest of your life.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.580]   Why do you keep going?
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.980]   I mean, for me individually, I always
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:32.040]   want to prove stuff to myself to see if I can do something.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.120]   And I actually really enjoy-- even
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.800]   though I'm kind of an introvert in certain ways
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.360]   and I'm very guarded in others, I do enjoy people.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.800]   And being around the sports world,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.360]   I have to pinch myself some of the people that I get to meet,
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.080]   some of the people I get to interact with.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.520]   Because we're from all walks of life all over the world.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.400]   You mentioned Arsenal.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.760]   I just got back from London last night.
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   And we advanced in the Champions League on Tuesday.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.600]   But the people that I get to meet--
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.760]   I mean, just with the Nuggets alone.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.860]   I mean, we have guys from all over Europe.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:11.360]   When you get to Arsenal, it's even a greater expansion
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.120]   of people.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.260]   And so I really enjoy the different people,
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.800]   the different walks of life, and being
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:19.880]   able to prove to myself that I can work with almost anybody
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.680]   and try to get the best out of a group.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.240]   I think, to your point, I don't know where my IQ might be,
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.400]   but I think my EQ is fairly high.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.840]   And putting people in positions, giving them
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.480]   the resources to succeed, patting them on the back,
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.360]   putting my arm around them when they need it,
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.200]   and then give them a little kick in the butt
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.400]   when they need it, too.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.000]   But our formula is to really hire good people,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.200]   provide them with the resources to go do things,
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.920]   and then draft good people who can
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.360]   have a chance to be great players,
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.640]   and try to grow it over time.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.600]   And that's what we've done with the Nuggets.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.600]   That's what we've done with the Avalanche.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.800]   Over at Arsenal, we have a really talented young team
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.280]   that's fighting for both Premier League title this year,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.360]   and hopefully another advancement in the Champions
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   League in the quarters.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.680]   We just drew Bayern Munich today.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.480]   That's going to be an interesting one.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.360]   But it's really about the people.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.480]   And for me, that's what drives me.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.400]   But yeah, I mean, I have been financially secure
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.020]   my whole life.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.180]   I understand that most people or a lot of people
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.900]   aren't in that situation.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.760]   And so I never want to take that for granted.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:24.320]   But also, we employ a lot of people.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   That's something that I do find very rewarding,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.360]   is being able to sit down and talk
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.720]   to people about their jobs, whether it's over in London,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.920]   whether it's in Denver, or whether it's in LA,
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.200]   at our team in our venue out there.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:37.720]   So yeah, for me, it's about the people
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:40.200]   and trying to work together to achieve something special.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.160]   And when you do achieve something special, man,
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.200]   it's a lot of fun for not only the group,
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:48.380]   but for the fans as well, which is really unique to really
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.700]   the sports business.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.020]   Now, even just talking to you, I feel
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.500]   like the way you grew up and just who you are as a person,
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.200]   and I feel like you really know yourself.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.700]   You've probably spent a lot of time getting to know yourself
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.300]   and what makes you happy.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.020]   So one of the questions I like to ask all the people
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.860]   I interview on this podcast is, what do you
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.180]   think your purpose is?
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:10.580]   Wow.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.200]   I think my purpose is--
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.300]   that's a great question, Michael.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.880]   I wish I knew you were going to ask me that one.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.100]   I ask it because I still feel like I'm
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.200]   trying to develop my purpose.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.800]   And part of who I like to get on this podcast
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.280]   is people that I find very intriguing
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   and I'm very curious about, and people
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.600]   I look up to in certain ways.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.560]   So yeah, I'm trying to figure out.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.640]   So it's just a question I like to ask.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   You know, I think that--
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.460]   I'm sure I'd have to go back and re-watch some of your podcasts
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.540]   because I'd be a very curious answer
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.340]   from a lot of different people.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.640]   For me, I think my purpose--
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:50.820]   I'm not married.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.500]   I don't have any kids yet.
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.180]   And so some people would answer family or this.
[00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.780]   And so I come from a great family, great parents.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.000]   My older sister is incredibly supportive.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.420]   And I have a wonderful girlfriend
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.500]   who supports me as well.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.560]   But I think for me, personally, I think my purpose is to--
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.400]   you know, I think kind of how I answered the previous question
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.720]   was I really enjoy getting to know people
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.200]   and trying to get the most out of them.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.560]   My college coach, Quinn Snyder, always
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   thought I would've been a great basketball coach
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.440]   because I loved the game, but I also
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:32.040]   really loved trying to get the most and help my teammates.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.880]   And so that kind of plays out in my life
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.660]   across numerous areas, whether it's
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.100]   focused in on the team level with the Nuggets, Avs, Rams,
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:43.160]   Arsenal, Rapids, or on the corporate level,
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.500]   we just wonder when a big restructure on our corporate
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.240]   side in Denver.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.300]   And so putting together the team there and kind of delivering
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.920]   some of the same mantras that we have around our team culture,
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.960]   try to deliver that on the corporate side as well.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.720]   And having been around sports my whole life,
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.100]   I think I got a pretty decent handle on certain things
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.000]   at this point.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.480]   And so trying to get the most out of people
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.740]   and then really going to achieve something together.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:10.000]   So building a team and helping those people along,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   I think that'd be probably how I would answer it
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.160]   on an individual level.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.200]   Because when I'm by myself and doing things by myself,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.000]   I enjoy it.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.720]   But I enjoy being around people and being around groups
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.400]   and working together a lot more.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:22.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.000]   That's dope, man.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.320]   Well, I appreciate you so much for giving us some of your time,
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:26.520]   man.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.760]   This has been awesome for real.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.400]   Absolutely.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.880]   Appreciate you, my man.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.920]   Serious Mike out.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.860]   (upbeat music)
