[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Bennett writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I recently read the following in a book,
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.200]   "God purposefully created the world to function in such a way that He is not enough for us.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.160]   That is why God says it is not good for man to be alone. If God were all that Adam needed, then Adam would not be
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.880]   alone, but he is alone. Not because God is there, but because one of his kind is not there.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.840]   By choice, God limited his ability to be everything Adam needed.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.160]   This flies in the face of what many of us have heard on a regular basis.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.740]   I hear people say, 'All you need is God. God is enough.' Well, that sounds nice,
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.240]   but the problem is that it's not true or even biblical for that matter from a
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   relational point of view. If we're talking about grace, then these statements are true. God's grace is enough.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.040]   However, if we're talking about relationships, they are not so."
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.440]   So, Pastor John, does Christian hedonism teach that God is enough to satisfy every relational longing of our souls,
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.160]   or has God created us with an intrinsic need for others that God cannot satisfy?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   How would you answer Bennett on this question?
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.320]   That is an absolutely
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.240]   excellent question, and the reason it's an excellent question is that it grows out of a text.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.640]   Genesis 2 18, "And the Lord God said, 'It's not good that a man should be alone.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.960]   I will make a helper fit for him.'" So on the face of it, God clearly does not want Adam to respond,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.400]   'No, thank you. You've got it wrong, God. I am not alone. I have you!'
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.240]   So God thinks the present state of creation is not the final good that he intends,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.000]   namely the man and the woman having God together.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.280]   So having another human being is not a
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.240]   luxury in God's mind. So it seems
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080]   Bennett's case here is pretty strong.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.160]   It looks like an overstatement to say to Adam in the garden,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720]   "God is all you need." And let's make the case stronger
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.640]   by adding a few other texts, like 1 Corinthians 12. "God arranged the members of the body,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.080]   each one of them as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? As it is,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.680]   there are many parts, yet one body, the eye."
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.400]   So let's say
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.560]   Tony Reinke is the eye. "The eye cannot say to the hand," that's John Piper,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080]   "I have no need of you."
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.640]   Nor again, "The head can say to the feet, I have no need of you."
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   So there's God Almighty in his words saying flat out,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.960]   "You dare not say to another
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.640]   member of the body of Christ, 'I don't need you.'" That's a sin to talk like that.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.360]   In other words, God forbids us from saying, "I have God. I don't need members of the body of Christ."
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.400]   Lots of other examples could be cited. We're
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.320]   commanded to pray, "Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.000]   And we're told not to be anxious about food and about clothing because Jesus said—now mark these words—
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.840]   "Your heavenly Father knows that you
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.600]   need
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   them all."
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.700]   So clearly, God created a material universe,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.360]   not just a world of spirits, and He created other souls, not just one soul to relate to Him, and He created
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.640]   society and the church, not just isolated souls relating to Him. And in doing all of this,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.660]   creating the world, creating the church, creating society, He ordained
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.240]   that we be benefited by all these things and that some of them
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.720]   be essential for life—food, water, shelter, clothing, air—
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.960]   and others be essential for obedience, like love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.160]   You couldn't obey that command if there were no neighbors. You need a neighbor in order to obey the command, "Love your
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.360]   neighbor." So it's not wrong to talk about needing the neighbor in the sense that God has set it up
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.920]   that way. And all this
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.600]   is a result of God not creating just idolatry or occasions for idolatry, but
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.960]   creation. He created these
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.560]   things. He created us with those kinds of needs
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.080]   that He Himself
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.760]   would meet only in the sense of giving them to us, but not being them
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   for us. So, question, should we say, "God is enough,"
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   or "I don't need any more than God"?
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.520]   And there's a good reason why those statements stick in our craw.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.360]   I can tell they do by this question, and they do in mine.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.200]   Why do they sound belittling to God when we say them, "God is not enough," or "I've got enough. I don't need
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.120]   God"? The reason is that one of the most important teachings of the Bible
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:28.520]   is that when all our human needs go unmet and we are utterly alone and on the brink of death,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.680]   God will never fail us. And in that moment,
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   He will be
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   enough.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.840]   That's what we mean
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.120]   when we honor God by saying, "He's all I need." In other words, if all my needs fail to be met,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.280]   He will never fail.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.520]   That's the point of Romans 8:35, right?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.420]   "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" Tribulation, distress, persecution,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.680]   famine, nakedness, peril, sword. The point of that list
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:09.000]   is that all those God-given needs—they're real needs for life and for obedience—all those God-given needs
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.840]   may fail.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.480]   Famine may take food away. Nakedness may take clothing away. Sword may take
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.840]   life and limb away. In other words, every good and perfect gift that God has given us to need,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.320]   in one sense,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.500]   is being shown in this moment not to be needed ultimately.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.380]   No.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.460]   In all these things, we are more than conquerors. Nothing can separate us from
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.100]   Christ. He is enough
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.180]   in that
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.140]   moment. That's why we feel like we're dishonoring Him
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:51.180]   if we say we don't need Him or we have other things that we need also, and He can't satisfy.
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.220]   Now, I emphasize
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.980]   in that moment
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.220]   because God is still committed
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.420]   to the world He created, and in the resurrection, He will give back
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.860]   what He has taken away in death.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:15.340]   He will have taught us in the moment of death to rely wholly on Him. Paul talks that way in 2 Corinthians 1, 8, and 9.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.180]   Then,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.680]   one more thing needs to be emphasized.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.780]   Even in
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.780]   wife, food,
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.700]   church members,
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.300]   and all the other
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.260]   life-sustaining, life-enhancing needs that God
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.360]   gives us, He Himself remains
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.780]   the cream of all those pleasures, the way the Puritans talked.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.740]   When we
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:52.140]   have those pleasures rightly, we are enjoying God in and through wife and
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.180]   nature and wonders and
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.960]   food so that they're not really in competition
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.540]   with Him, and in one sense,
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:11.020]   we can say, "I have God in all those things, not just God in addition to all those things which satisfy me." So in the end,
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.740]   our need for people
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.820]   and our need for food
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.140]   becomes a way to say,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.740]   "See,
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:27.260]   here I am in this gift, God says to us. See, here I am in this gift. Do you see me?
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:34.060]   Do you enjoy me in this?" And so it turns out that God, in creating what is not God,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.100]   created a world in which God Himself
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.220]   would be most fully known and most fully
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.220]   enjoyed. Amen. That is awesome. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.200]   And if you, like Bennett, have a question for Pastor John, please email it in to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:59.980]   We return tomorrow to look at one prayer you can pray for your family every single day.
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.540]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
