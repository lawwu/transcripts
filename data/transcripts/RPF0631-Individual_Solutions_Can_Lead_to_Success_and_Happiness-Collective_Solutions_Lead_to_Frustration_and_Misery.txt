[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:57.360]   didnt even notice the background. Over the last two weeks I have finished recording, outlining and producing my newest course which is called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis. I'm really proud of it. It wound up being 13 hours and 3 minutes of very carefully edited and thought out content trying to answer all the questions that I could anticipate on how to survive and thrive during any coming economic crisis. I laid out a raft of solutions that I'll put up against anybody else's solutions in the world as well.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   The content is available on my website at www.theprofessor.com/services
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   and I'll post a link to the website in the description below.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   Thank you for watching.

[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.720]   I talked to you about wha
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.760]   of the problem. I shared
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.100]   or might not work. And I

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   It's not just a question
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   It's not just a question
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   that I had a problem with.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   It's not just a question

[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   that problem. It's not just
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   that problem. It's not just a question that I had a problem
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   that I had a problem with. It's not just a question that I had a problem with.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:54.060]   that I had a problem with. It's not just a question that I had a problem with.

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.700]   Now, let's talk about those i individual solutions so that you can understand.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.740]   And then I'll give you some other examples.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.660]   If you want to be prepared to survive and thrive an economic crisis,
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.400]   your solution is very simple.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.760]   You disconnect yourself from the economic systems that may fail,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.020]   to the highest degree possible.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.400]   You build resiliency and reserves into your own life and into your own lifestyle.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.920]   You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.100]   You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   completely different from the other way around.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   You build resiliency and reserves into your own life and into your own lifestyle. You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.100]   completely different from the other way around. You build resilience and reserves into your own life and into your own lifestyle. You disconnect yourself from being completely
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:23.140]  , and you create plans to go where things are better. That's the basic outline of the whole course.

If you look at at least the U.S. American society, look at the U.S. American culture, as people go nuts trying to force other people and stop, and they've stopped respecting our individual autonomy to run our own lives, run our own lives as we see fit and be responsible for the results. And people try to step in and say, well, I'm going to take all these decisions for you. Nonsense. You're not making any progress. You're not winning any converts.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.980]   So start with your individual action.
