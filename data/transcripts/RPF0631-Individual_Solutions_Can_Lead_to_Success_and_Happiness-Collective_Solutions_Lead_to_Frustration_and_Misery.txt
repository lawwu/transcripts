[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.160]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.600]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.560]   Today on the show I want to talk to you about how to harness the power of individual solutions
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.920]   so that you can have a more positive frame of mind, a more optimistic view of the future,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.320]   and more power in the present to actually accomplish the change that you would like
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   to see.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.720]   So, about 90 seconds of background.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.900]   Over the last two weeks I have finished recording, outlining, and producing my newest course
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.080]   which is called How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   I'm really proud of it.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.000]   It wound up being 13 hours and 3 minutes of very carefully edited and thought out content
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.160]   trying to answer all the questions that I could anticipate on how to survive and thrive
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   during any coming economic crisis.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.320]   I laid out a raft of solutions that I'll put up against anybody else's solutions in the
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.480]   world as being effective and low cost, or at least relatively low cost, good effective
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.640]   insurance policies to put in place in your life to protect you against an economic crisis.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.600]   And yet the whole time I did that I was struck by how simple and feasible my solutions are
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.280]   for the average person, and yet how utterly impossible any collective solution is for
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.960]   the average person.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.400]   And I see an epidemic of people who are increasingly committed to collective solutions being the
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.360]   only solution, and yet beating their head against the wall, and instead of finding peace
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.240]   and happiness and optimism and comfort, just finding frustration and anger and lashing
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.160]   out on all sides.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.800]   And I want to help you avoid that if possible.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.080]   I'm convinced that if you look at almost any problem, you will find that the individual
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.400]   solutions to that problem are powerful, and yet the collective solutions to that problem
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   are almost impossible.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.840]   I want to use two examples just as my archetypes, because I can't think of two bigger, more
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.000]   discussed problems than this.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.880]   The first one is the economic debt crisis that I outlined in the past couple of shows.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.320]   In exhaustive detail, I worked through the problem, I talked to you about what is at
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.700]   the root of the problem, I shared with you potential solutions and why those potential
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.640]   solutions might or might not work, and I laid out the situation.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.460]   And I was very clear that I view the problem of national debt as insoluble.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.160]   It is insoluble.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.520]   And I have a few ideas on how I think it will go, and time will tell.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.680]   In fact, in the How to Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis, I did a
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.200]   whole module on what I think will happen, which I didn't do here on the show publicly.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.120]   In the course, however, I did a whole module on here's what I think will happen in the
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.560]   coming economic crisis, because I don't think it's a doomsday scenario, but neither is it
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.280]   all rosy and good.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.140]   The other example that I want to use is the discussion of climate change, global climate
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140]   change.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.760]   And I thought about this a lot myself, and I had a listener of mine point this out as
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   well, that basically these two problems face similar characteristics.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.640]   They are massive, they are huge, they are long-running.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   The worst case scenario seems utterly abhorrent.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.040]   And yet I would say that there are individual solutions to both of them, individual solutions
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.240]   that would lead to peace and prosperity, etc.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.680]   Now let's talk about those individual solutions so that you can understand, and then I'll
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.880]   give you some other examples.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.360]   If you want to be prepared to survive and thrive an economic crisis, your solution is
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.540]   very simple.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.160]   You disconnect yourself from the economic systems that may fail, to the highest degree
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   possible.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.480]   You build resiliency and reserves into your own life and into your own lifestyle.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.080]   You disconnect yourself from being completely controlled by the functions of the economy,
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.160]   and you create plans to go where things are better.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.280]   That's the basic outline of the whole course, and I'm going to go into detail on all of
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   those.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.640]   And the same thing I think should apply to something like global climate change.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.200]   If you are really concerned about global climate change, I want to see you put your money where
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.280]   your mouth is.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.360]   I don't want to, if you're concerned about the rise in sea levels, then don't buy a house
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.880]   by the ocean.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.480]   If you're concerned that the climate is going to become warm, don't live where it's already
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.000]   hot and it's just going to get hotter.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.680]   Move where it's currently cold and we'll get more pleasant.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.660]   If you're concerned that there will be massive swings, I think you need to plan for greater
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660]   climate variability.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.880]   One of my favorite guys on this would be Ben Falk.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   I've had him on the show many hundreds of episodes ago.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.880]   But one of the things that he does in all of his permaculture design work is he designs
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.000]   for varying climates.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so if he lives in, I don't remember what zone of climate, of agricultural production
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.260]   he lives in, but if you live in, say, zone seven, you should put plants in your property
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.360]   that would thrive in zone eight, and you should put plants in your property that would thrive
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   in zone six.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.520]   And you should go ahead and plant your property now so that you have a suite of food-bearing
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.980]   plants that will thrive in different conditions.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.760]   That way, if it's unusually cold, then your plants that are more well-suited for cold
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   solutions will flourish more.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.640]   If it's unusually warm, then your plants that are suited for more warm climates will flourish
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.640]   more.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.160]   And you want to build that resiliency into your life.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.480]   I want to do that in financial planning.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.040]   I'm not knowledgeable enough to do that with things you grow, but I can do that with financial
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   planning.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.800]   And you hear that again and again, build resiliency into your life so that you can stretch, that
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.480]   you can grow, so you can take advantage of opportunities, so you can be protected from
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.840]   things that are coming.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.760]   And so in many ways, I look at these solutions as very much—sorry, these problems as very
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.260]   much parallel.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.680]   And what I look for on the climate perspective is, since I am incompetent to judge the argument,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.640]   the scientific arguments, et cetera, I study them, I look at them, I'm open to various
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.080]   sides being right, but I often find there's so many assumptions that were built upon assumption,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.720]   built on assumption, built on assumption, built on data.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.960]   It's so complex that you look at it, and it's very hard for a layperson like me to draw
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.840]   a conclusion.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.120]   And so what I look at, I look and say, "Well, what would I do if I believed this, and what
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.320]   would I do if I didn't believe this?"
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.560]   And I try to align my actions that way.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.280]   And so I tell you as an individual, I'll know you're serious about climate change when I
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.560]   see you not owning waterfront property.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.440]   In fact, I'll believe that businesses think that—know that they're serious about climate
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.000]   change when they start selling waterfront property, and when they start encouraging
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.480]   people to plant gardens instead of fertilizing with petroleum-based fertilizer, and when
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.440]   I see people talking about actual methods that individuals can do to lock up carbon
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.320]   in the ground by pulling it out of the atmosphere with good growth, et cetera.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.840]   And I don't want to destroy, simplify what is difficult, but the point is, I look for
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.720]   individual solutions.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.320]   And when I see people advocating for individual solutions and not just advocating for collective
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   systems of control, then I want to follow what they have to say.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.360]   And the same thing applies to debt.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.400]   Now let me get back to areas where I know, and I'm a little more competent, which is
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.440]   money and debt.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.920]   You can't solve the collective debt crisis.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.160]   I can't solve the collective debt crisis.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.720]   And I'm not going to waste much of any time talking about solutions or wrestling with
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   that.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.800]   I'm not going to be out arguing for higher taxes or lower taxes or change this or change
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   that.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   I'm not going to waste my time with that.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.160]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to look at it and say, "What can I as an individual
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   do?
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.320]   How can I teach other individuals to do what I see able to be done?"
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.880]   And exactly the same thing, I'm not going to waste my time dealing with big, giant climate
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.440]   arguments and arguing about taxing the whole world to try to make things better.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.400]   I'm going to look and say, "What do I see individuals do?"
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.320]   By the way, I would commend to you one piece of hope.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   If you are really struggling, if you, and I know many people are, where they, evidently
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.880]   this is an epidemic among young people, where you feel like there's no hope, there's no
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.200]   future, and people are talking about not having children.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.160]   It's the big latest thing about, "We're not going to have children because how can you
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.520]   have children when there's a climate crisis coming," etc.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.480]   If you feel that way, I would beg you, go and educate yourself on what some people in
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.160]   the world are doing with regenerative agriculture.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.240]   The video that disabused me of any concern about climatological future, years ago I found
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.400]   Jeff Lawton's book, sorry, his old video called "Greening the Desert."
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.440]   Jeff Lawton was a permaculture designer who was given a plot of land near the Dead Sea,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.760]   which is just a totally destroyed plot of land.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.160]   He was given the task, "What can you do with this plot of land?"
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.640]   When you see the results that he got on a tiny little budget, and then you see the power
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.400]   that he has been able to, the things that he's been able to do over the past decade
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.600]   or two with very little money, it's life changing, it's world changing.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.520]   I would guess, although I'm not sure, I would guess that Lawton has major concerns about
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.000]   the future of the planet.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.040]   Obviously he does.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.240]   But yet the thing is, he doesn't spend, at least in any of my knowledge, he doesn't spend
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.920]   any time worrying about that stuff.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.960]   He just focuses on solutions.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   And that's what I would encourage you.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.960]   If you're concerned about that, go and learn the solutions to it.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.160]   Because if you can watch a man turn a destroyed piece of desert land with hardly any rainfall
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.880]   into a lush garden on a dime, it should give you some confidence that we can turn any desert
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   of the world into an absolutely magnificent oasis given time, resources, and focus.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.800]   So I hope that gives you help.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.680]   But I want to stay where I'm competent, which is especially with finance, not with that
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   stuff.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.720]   And just say this, individual solutions are available to you.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.920]   Let's say you're concerned about wealth, and you're concerned about, insert this group
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.560]   of people you care about, that's not wealthy.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.000]   You probably can't do anything to help that giant group of people.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.240]   But what you can do is you can get wealthy yourself.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.480]   You can't get your preferred group to get wealthy, but you can become wealthy yourself.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.120]   You can't control those people, but you can control yourself.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   And then if you control yourself, and you get wealthy, you can teach one person, and
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.960]   another person, and another person, and another person.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.920]   And this is going to be far more effective for you than any advocacy for big forced solutions
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.080]   on people.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.200]   Just choose an individual solution, and then teach that individual solution to another
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.600]   person.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.160]   The pathology of thinking that you can control other people, no matter how well-meaning you
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   are, will lead you to insanity.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.880]   But you don't have to do that to make a change in the world.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.280]   Just change yourself, and set an example for your neighbor.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.520]   Set an example there.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.400]   Collective solutions are always hard, but individual solutions are easy, or at least
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   feasible.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   Interestingly, collective solutions rarely work, but individual solutions almost always
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.880]   work because the individuals have a stake in the game.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.760]   They're willing to change their actions if it's not working.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.400]   Collective solutions often don't work just simply because there's no accountability.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.920]   Somebody will come up with some solution, some government will fund it to the tune of
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.440]   hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.680]   It won't work, but they won't ever admit that it won't work, they'll just ask for more money.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.560]   But yet the individual looks at what's not working and says, "That didn't work, I'm
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.920]   going to change."
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.440]   As individuals, we can change on a dime.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.280]   You don't have to depend on anyone else for your life decisions, just change yourself.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.000]   Collective solutions will usually lead you to frustration, because you'll be frustrated,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   "Why don't these people see what I see?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.920]   Why don't those people do what I think they should do?"
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.240]   Whereas individual solutions will usually lead you to satisfaction and confidence, because
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.520]   you'll make the decisions that you think are right, you'll test the results of those decisions,
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.680]   if you like the results, you'll do more of it, and you'll grow increasingly confident.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.440]   So don't waste your time arguing for collective solutions, that means you'll probably fail,
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.040]   because you'll spend so much time and energy arguing for those things, you'll miss out
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.260]   on what's before you, on the simple things that you can do.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.680]   Don't do it.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.080]   Focus on your individual solutions.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:41.960]   And I've talked about the debt crisis, you can put in place a strategy to survive and
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   thrive in any coming economic crisis, you absolutely can.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.000]   In every crisis, there are people who not only hang on, meaning survive, there are people
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.800]   who get rich, because they're prepared for crisis.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.740]   Now you can study what happened, you can study what they did, and you can do the same thing.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.560]   There's not a 100% guarantee, obviously, just like there's not a 100% guarantee that any
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.380]   of us are on the earth tomorrow.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.520]   But there's a very strong guarantee, and you're going to have a lot more success if you make
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.120]   a plan for yourself and your family, than if you try to change the US federal government.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.920]   With climate change, if you're concerned about climate change, make a plan.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.160]   Figure out what you can do on your property to take carbon out of the atmosphere.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.840]   I have immense respect for so many people that I have found who are so productive, and
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.920]   you study what they have done and how they have made their land productive and how they've
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.880]   used grass and vegetation to take carbon out of the atmosphere and all these things.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.740]   I have immense respect for them.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.120]   That is the thing to do.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.280]   And then the same thing with people who drive big scale solutions, but pay attention to
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   the people who move.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   If you're worried about it, move.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   Go where you're not going to be impacted, etc.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.560]   And then there's so many other things, especially things that relate to finances.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.200]   For example, over the last few months in the United States, I've watched the political
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   argument regarding paid maternity leave.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.280]   There's a big argument that in the United States, championed by President Trump's daughter,
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.920]   Ivanka Trump, that the United States should move to do what many of the governments of
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.040]   the world do, which is to mandate longer time stamps of paid parental leave after the birth
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.720]   of a baby.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.440]   And then this also is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently made news about
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.120]   how they'd changed their parental leave policy, or at least their maternal leave policy, from
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.800]   one year to six months and why they were doing that, etc.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.600]   Well, this is, of course, of interest to me because my wife and I are having another baby,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.460]   and it's a fascinating thing, of course, to be in that situation.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.160]   But I would just point out to you that you don't have to wait on a government law to
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.640]   try to force people to pay you for maternity leave.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.920]   Just plan ahead and make a plan so that you can take time off.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.800]   My wife has not had any working income since having a baby.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.360]   That was because we made a plan and we did it.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:59.840]   And the future of our life did not depend upon my convincing tens of millions of US
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.760]   Americans to try to support me so that I can take their money and support my family.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.280]   That's my job.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.660]   Our decision was very simple.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.880]   We never spent the income that my wife earned when she was working and we were newly married.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.240]   We never spent a dime of it.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.200]   We lived in a $500 a month apartment.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.340]   We saved like crazy.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.800]   We learned how to be frugal.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.520]   And because of that, when she came home and stopped working at an income-producing job
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:28.760]   and started working at a human-producing job, then we were able to have extended maternity
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.560]   leave without depending on other people.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.140]   You can do that, too.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   Every single thing.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.480]   You can do that, too.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.500]   You don't have to convince people to try to say, "Well, you should cancel my student
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   loan debt."
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.600]   Cancel your own student loan debt.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.640]   I've paid off my loans.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.160]   You can pay off yours, too.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.520]   Get other people to stop borrowing money for student loans.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   I do that.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   You can do that, too.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.680]   You don't have to come up with a coercive governmental solution and lobby for that,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.120]   meanwhile putting your entire life on hold.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.520]   There's no need for it.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.760]   Just focus on an individual solution that you can do.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   You can do it.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.320]   And you're going to be far more optimistic and far more confident in doing that.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.860]   And you'll have a much better go of convincing others to follow you if you lead by example
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.840]   than if you try to force others to do something that they may or may not want to do.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.000]   Now, is there a place for collective action?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Maybe.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.400]   I'm open to it.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.440]   I think there may be times and there may be places where you have to have collective action.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.040]   And I could make a list of specific issues where I think you do have to have collective
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.000]   action, where I think ultimately a collective solution is required.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.680]   But what I would say is you will never get collective action to work until you have a
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.720]   long history of individuals who inspire other individuals.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.120]   Forcing people to do something does not work in the long run.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.800]   Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.400]   You can put a law on me, forcing something on me.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.120]   But unless you convince me that it's the right thing, you're not going to get compliance
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   from me.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.320]   And I think you look at that, if you look at at least the US American society, look
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.040]   at the US American culture, as people go nuts trying to force other people and stop, and
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.440]   they've stopped respecting our individual autonomy to run our own lives, run our own
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.340]   lives as we see fit and be responsible for the results.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.920]   And people try to step in and say, "Well, I'm going to take all these decisions for
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   you."
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   Nonsense.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   You're not making any progress.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.380]   You're not winning any converts.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.160]   So start with your individual action and recognize that you as an individual can put in place
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.800]   a plan that will provide you with almost any solution if you'll stop worrying about other
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.040]   people.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.120]   If you've got $150,000 of student loan debt and you're sick and tired of having that student
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.000]   loan debt, you will not have that student loan debt paid off faster because you go and
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.400]   join Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.360]   It'd be much better for you to put the time in, go and get a couple extra jobs, live in
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.920]   your car, and pay off your student loan debt.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.680]   And a year or two years from now, you'll be out of debt, you'll be free.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.920]   Meanwhile, you'll watch a whole bunch of other people utterly miserable with the fact that
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.320]   their preferred political candidate lost, or even if they won, with the fact that they
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.240]   can't get the Congress to go along, or they can't get the people to do that, or the people
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.320]   rise up and start tax protests or something like that, you'll be free because you step
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.800]   up and pay off your student loan debt.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.500]   If you want to have a baby and you want to have maternity leave for your baby, then sit
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.880]   down and make a plan to have that so that you can have maternity leave for your baby.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.160]   Don't sit around and think, "Well, if we just elected the right person in office, and if
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.360]   Ivanka Trump could just convince President Trump to make this happen and we could just
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.320]   get the Congress to go along with it, then I could have a baby."
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   It ain't gonna work.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   Because you're...
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.600]   Let me just say practically on that issue, it's not gonna work because you're not gonna
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.560]   be hired.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.800]   And you can sue all day long, but at the end of the day, you're not gonna be hired.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.760]   If somebody is concerned about you bringing a whole bunch of additional costs because
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.640]   now they gotta pay for your maternity leave, not gonna work.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.900]   You're not gonna be hired.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.120]   So now your job prospects are gonna go down even more.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   It's not gonna work.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.760]   You cannot force people to do what you want them to do just because you want them to do
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.000]   it, just because you get together with a few tens of millions of other people.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.320]   But what you can do is you can put in place a plan where you can have extended maternity
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   leave.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   That's doable.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.160]   So you can on the one hand sit around and spend the next few years of your life arguing
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.400]   and frustrated about getting things to change, and at the end of those few years, you won't
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.280]   have a baby and nothing will have changed.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.200]   Or you can put a plan in place and say, "How do we trim our expenses?
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.640]   How do we increase our income?
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.400]   How do we have an extended maternity leave so that I can take care of my baby?"
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.800]   And a few years from now, have a baby, happy baby in your lap, and you can enjoy that,
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.320]   and you can go on with your life.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   Climate change.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.280]   Don't try to get people to change their ideas on climate change.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.980]   Just set an example for them.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.720]   Show people what they can do.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.360]   And on this issue, I beg of you, if you are a strong, if you're strongly concerned with
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.400]   climate change, I have looked for the ideas that people are proffering to say, "Hey, here's
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.080]   what you can do as an individual."
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.240]   I have looked for them.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.080]   Do you know who I see doing the most of them?
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.400]   It's people who don't even think climate change is that big of a deal, for whatever reason.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.920]   Now time will tell what the situation is, but if you'll focus on individual actions,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.120]   then you'll be ready to take it on.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.540]   You won't have a house by the edge of the sea.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.920]   You won't be in a hot place that's going to get hotter.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.560]   You won't be in a place where hurricanes are going to impact you.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.400]   Move to the Rocky Mountains.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   Move to Canada.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.080]   Move to a place where you're going to be less susceptible to climate change.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.760]   And then I'll believe you, and I'll follow you, etc.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.040]   The same thing with debt crisis, and many other issues.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.960]   You and I are not going to solve the debt crisis.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.600]   All we can do is sit back and watch what happens.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.380]   Now I'm going to use my platform to try to talk about what I think should happen from
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.380]   time to time.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.560]   I think there's time in that, just like it's good for us to talk about issues and have
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.340]   good arguments and debates, etc.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.920]   We need to work through those things.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.320]   And there are things of collective import.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.200]   But you're going to listen to me a whole lot more when you can see that I have done what
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.080]   needs to be done in order to be protected from that.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.760]   And I'm going to listen to you a whole lot more when I see that you take something seriously
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.280]   enough to take action.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.800]   So that's the summary of what I want to share with you.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.240]   Just recognize, when you face big problems, the collective solutions are hard, if not
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   impossible.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:36.240]   But the individual solutions are usually simpler, easier, or at least feasible.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:42.080]   So start with what's simple and easier and feasible and do that first, and then possibly
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.260]   move on to a collective solution.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.640]   The collective solutions rarely work, because you're not sure which one will work.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.880]   But the individual solutions almost always work, because you can adjust and change.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.920]   Those collective solutions usually lead to frustration.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.560]   Whereas your individual solutions usually lead you to satisfaction and confidence.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.920]   I want you to live a rich and meaningful life now.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.280]   I want you to be inspired to live that life now and to build from a place of calm confidence.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.720]   I want you to be in a strong position so that you can reach out and help the weak.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.840]   But in order to do that, you and I both, and I'm preaching to myself, you and I both have
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.560]   to largely, not necessarily entirely, but we have to largely walk away from trying to
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   force other people to do what we think they should do and seek to lead by example, by
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.560]   fixing the problems in our own life with the best solutions that we can.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.600]   Then we may inspire a few of them to follow us.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.560]   And if a few of us inspire a few of them, and a few of them follow and inspire a few
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.320]   more, in time the whole collective solution can be changed.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.480]   But we don't start with the collective.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.900]   Start with you and start with me.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.280]   If you're concerned personally about facing an economic crisis of some kind, be it caused
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.520]   by the US national debt or be it caused by a job layoff or whatever, I would invite you
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.800]   to come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com and take a look at my newest course.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.740]   I am extremely proud of it.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.540]   It is really, really good.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.840]   If you just come by RadicalPersonalFinance.com, click on store, sign up to buy the course.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:17.400]   I have in that course dozens of ideas that could result in millions of dollars of profit.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.840]   I've always struggled to try to profit in savings.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.760]   I've always struggled to try to figure out how much of my stuff do I give away versus
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.360]   how much stuff do I sell.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.200]   And it's hard because I feel like since I've learned everything I've learned just by reading
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.920]   books and it's all out there, I almost feel like, "Well, I should just give it all away
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.240]   in a podcast and make it simple for people."
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.800]   But I've chosen to do a couple of things.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.000]   First, I'm focusing more and more of my time and attention on people who have specific
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.920]   questions and that means my students.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.480]   So you'll notice, for example, if you were to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com, I don't
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   have a place for comments on the site.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.960]   Now I might bring comments in the future, but comments are a very tiring thing because
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.400]   I want to answer everyone's questions and it's like, "How do I do that?"
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.780]   I can't make a collective solution, so I make an individual solution.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.840]   By putting all the comments and the discussion behind a paywall, behind the course for my
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.320]   students, then I can spend time on that and really feel good about my investing that time.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   So I would invite you to give that a shot.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.360]   The other thing that I do in a course and that I can do is I can always be a little
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.720]   bit more vulnerable.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.300]   It's hard in the public sphere to say, "What am I going to put on the internet where anybody
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.840]   who wants to can grab a soundbite, etc."
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:28.840]   That's a little hard.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.240]   But if I put it in a course, at least it takes the 99% of the people and just tosses them
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.860]   into the dust because most of the trolls and whatnot don't bother to actually pay for anything.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.360]   And so if you want to discuss with me something like that, come on by and try that course.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.440]   I've had wonderful feedback so far on people who really like it.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.920]   So far, there have been high rates of satisfaction.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.520]   We'll see as students continue the curriculum.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.920]   I hope that remains true.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.480]   But come on by RadicalPersonalFinance.com, click on the store and join me for how to
