[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.040]   My guest today is Dr. Mary-Claire Haver.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.680]   Dr. Mary-Claire Haver is a board-certified OBGYN
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.960]   and an expert in perimenopause, menopause,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.760]   and all aspects of female-specific health.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.800]   During today's episode,
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.480]   Dr. Haver explains exactly what perimenopause
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.000]   and menopause represent
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.400]   in terms of their underlying psychology and biology,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.160]   and the specific actions that all women can and should take
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.040]   in order to navigate these stages in optimal health.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   She also describes the things
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.640]   that all women should know and do
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.880]   long before perimenopause arrives
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.840]   in order to best navigate perimenopause and menopause
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   once they arrive.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.720]   We discuss specific nutritional practices,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.660]   supplementation practices,
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720]   as well as conversations that you should have
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.060]   with your mother and with your physician,
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.360]   in particular, your OBGYN,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.900]   not just as perimenopause and menopause approach,
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.960]   but at every developmental stage.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.200]   A fair amount of our discussion
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.280]   centers around hormone replacement therapy,
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.840]   not just for estrogen, but for testosterone in women as well,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.960]   and the many misconceptions and controversies that exist
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.880]   around hormone replacement therapy for menopause.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.000]   Dr. Haver explains how the specific timing
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.160]   in which hormone therapy is initiated
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.840]   plays a key role in whether or not the hormone therapy
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.200]   is beneficial for women or not.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.280]   And of course, today's discussion gets into ways to offset
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.780]   some of the more common difficulties
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.160]   associated with menopause,
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240]   including sleep issues, hot flashes, inflammation, and more.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.980]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.040]   you will have a clear picture from Dr. Marie-Claire Haver
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.360]   about what perimenopause and menopause actually represent,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.720]   the best way to approach perimenopause and menopause,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.580]   and the various considerations
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.040]   around hormone therapy and lifestyle choices
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.800]   that can allow any woman to approach the years
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.280]   of perimenopause and menopause and beyond
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.800]   with the utmost vitality and wellness.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.680]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.320]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.920]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.000]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.880]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.120]   Our first sponsor is AeroPress.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.980]   AeroPress is like a French press,
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.580]   but a French press that always brews
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.980]   the perfect cup of coffee,
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.900]   meaning no bitterness and excellent taste.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.860]   AeroPress achieves the perfect cup of coffee
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.020]   because it uses a very short contact time
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.860]   between the hot water and the coffee.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.340]   The entire thing takes only about three minutes.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.900]   I started using an AeroPress over 10 years ago.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.420]   I first learned about it from a guy named Alan Adler.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.700]   He's a former Stanford engineer and inventor.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.460]   He developed the Arobi Frisbee,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.380]   which I believe still holds the Guinness Book of World's
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.900]   records for the furthest thrown object.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.720]   In any event, I'm a big fan of Adler's inventions.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.500]   So when I heard he developed a coffee maker, the AeroPress,
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.980]   I tried it and I found that indeed,
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.460]   it makes the best possible tasting cup of coffee.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.220]   And I'm not alone in my love of the AeroPress coffee maker.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.580]   With over 55,000 five-star reviews,
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.580]   AeroPress is the best reviewed coffee press in the world.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.620]   AeroPress also just released a new AeroPress Tumbler
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.380]   that makes brewing coffee when traveling
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.220]   or anywhere incredibly easy.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.500]   This new AeroPress Go+ is incredible.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.580]   It's super compact, easy to clean,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.780]   and you can use it anywhere.
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.820]   All you need is hot water and some coffee.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.420]   And again, it's very easy to clean up.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.780]   Also with Father's Day coming up,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.820]   it makes for a terrific Father's Day gift.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.540]   If you'd like to try AeroPress,
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.900]   you can go to aeropress.com/huberman, get 20% off.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.240]   AeroPress currently ships in the USA, Canada,
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.760]   and to over 60 other countries around the world.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.140]   Again, that's aeropress.com/huberman.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by 8Sleep.
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.140]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.020]   and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.460]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.900]   about the critical need for us to get adequate amounts
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.980]   of quality sleep each night.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.380]   One of the best ways to ensure a great night's sleep
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.900]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.300]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.340]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.800]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.480]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.540]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.420]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.380]   8Sleep makes it incredibly easy
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.880]   to control the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.660]   by allowing you to program the temperature
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.260]   of your mattress cover at the beginning,
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.780]   middle, and end of the night.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.500]   8Sleep also tracks your sleep with very high precision.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.740]   It will tell you how much slow wave sleep you're getting,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.900]   how much rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.860]   each of which is critical for different aspects
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.820]   of physical and emotional recovery during sleep.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.340]   And that allows you to dial in
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.780]   the exact temperature parameters to really ensure
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.140]   that you get the best possible night's sleep.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.020]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.660]   for well over three years now,
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.880]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.120]   8Sleep recently launched
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.560]   their newest generation pod cover, the Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.440]   The Pod 4 Ultra has improved cooling and heating capacity,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.600]   higher fidelity sleep tracking technology,
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760]   and it also has snoring detection
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.040]   that remarkably will automatically lift your head
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.160]   a few degrees to improve your airflow
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.280]   and stop your snoring.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   If you'd like to try an 8Sleep mattress cover,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.280]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.480]   to save $350 off their Pod 4 Ultra.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.420]   8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.720]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.140]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.940]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.820]   with a licensed therapist carried out completely online.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.140]   I've been going to therapy for over 30 years.
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.540]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.100]   It was a condition of being allowed back in high school,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.060]   but soon I realized that quality therapy
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.700]   can be extremely valuable.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.180]   And I now consider doing therapy
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.060]   as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.220]   including cardiovascular exercise and resistance training,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.180]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.140]   Therapy, provided it's with a therapist
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.020]   with whom you have excellent rapport and feel supported by,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.720]   and from whom you can gain valuable insights,
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.180]   can be immensely valuable
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.980]   because it leads to healthier thought patterns
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.960]   and actions related to your personal and professional life.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   In fact, I see doing quality therapy as a powerful way
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.380]   to direct your focus and attention
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.080]   toward what really matters.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.480]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.300]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.820]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.940]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Mary-Claire Haver.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.180]   Dr. Mary-Claire Haver, welcome.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.860]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.140]   - Delighted to have you here
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.500]   and to learn about menopause
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.900]   and other aspects of women's health.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.300]   There's a lot happening in this area right now,
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.780]   and you are at the center of what I understand
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.440]   is a new direction for the understanding
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.560]   and treatment of menopause.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.400]   - That's what we hope.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.140]   - And related themes like perimenopause.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.200]   And the many important aspects of female health
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.040]   that stem from it,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.080]   like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and so on.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.240]   So we will get into all of that today.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.200]   But just to kick things off, how do we define menopause?
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.480]   - So the medical definition of menopause,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.320]   which I have a huge problem with,
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.860]   is one year after the final menstrual period.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.760]   And the reason why I have a problem with it
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.820]   is not everyone has a menstrual period.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.960]   What if you've had a hysterectomy?
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.420]   What if you have an IUD?
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.700]   What if you've had an ablation
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.740]   or something that's suppressing your periods, PCOS?
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.300]   So for a lot of women and even clinicians,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.200]   they are struggling to find that diagnosis
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.820]   because it doesn't fit everything.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.080]   What it represents is something much bigger.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.820]   Menopause is also one day of your life.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.180]   It is that one day exactly one year after your last period.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   But it represents the end of your ovarian function.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.620]   Some of us call it ovarian failure, ovarian senescence.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.040]   But basically what separates males and females
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.960]   is many things separate us.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   But in my world, we are born with all of our eggs.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.140]   We have one to two million at birth.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.920]   By the time we're 30,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.140]   most of us are down to about 10%, maybe 120,000.
[00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.020]   By the time we're 40, we're down to 3% of our egg supply.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.300]   And the quality is declining as well.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.820]   So menopause is when you have no more eggs left
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.620]   and therefore no more sex hormone
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.260]   or very little sex hormone production from the ovaries.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.180]   So estradiol levels will decline
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.900]   less than 1% of your reproductive years.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.020]   Your progesterone levels will decline as well.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.020]   Testosterone declines for sure,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.820]   but we have other ways to produce it.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.920]   So it's somewhere 50% or less than your healthiest years.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.100]   - So is it fair to say that we need a redefinition
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.780]   of what menopause is?
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.740]   - I think so.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.420]   I think defining it as the presence or absence of a period
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.900]   is a mistake.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   - Is there any consensus about the quote unquote
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.780]   typical age of onset for menopause?
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.820]   And is it changing?
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.920]   You know, I hear a lot about how the onset of puberty
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.900]   is shifting earlier in females.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.620]   And given that puberty, at least by some definitions,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.520]   relates to the onset of menses,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.560]   one could imagine that menopause
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.720]   would be shifting earlier as well.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   - So the things that determine when we have puberty or not
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.240]   are different than the things that determine
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.060]   when we run out of eggs.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.480]   Right now in the US,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.500]   it's the average age of that one year after your cycle.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.040]   So menopause, that one day is about 51 to 52 years old.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.120]   However, normal is still 45 to 55,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.320]   and there's a big variation.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.080]   You know, that curve's pretty wide.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.120]   Perimenopause begins seven to 10 years
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.220]   before that last menstrual period.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.060]   - Wow, okay.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.560]   And I say wow, because it's the first time
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.560]   I've ever heard a specific number tacked to this word,
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.400]   perimenopause.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.700]   Maybe we could talk a little bit about perimenopause,
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   since it sounds like it represents a transition phase
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.380]   into official menopause.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.780]   However, one chooses to define that.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.540]   What are some of the,
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.260]   I don't know if I should call them symptoms,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.620]   or I should just-
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.220]   - Well, let me walk you through the endocrinology,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.780]   and then we can go through symptoms, so you understand.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.540]   So in a normal, healthy menstrual cycle,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.380]   before menopause ever becomes an issue,
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.500]   the female hormone cycle is a very EKG-like,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.100]   reproducible, monthly rise and fall
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.860]   of estrogen, progesterone,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.620]   and then the brain hormones, LHFSH, and then GnRH.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.380]   So the way it works is our brain, in the hypothalamus,
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.620]   is sensing for, has a little sensor in the blood,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.020]   looking for estradiol levels.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:48.900]   And when they get low,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.420]   it sends GnRH down to the pituitary, saying,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.780]   "Hey, tell the ovaries to start trying to ovulate
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.700]   "so we can get more estrogen on board."
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.820]   The process of ovulation is what drives up
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.820]   our estrogen levels, okay?
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.780]   So, pituitary sends out the pulses of LH and FSH,
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.940]   which then lead to ovulation.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.380]   When we reach, in perimenopause,
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   the beginning of perimenopause,
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.500]   that critical level of egg supply,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.620]   those signals don't work as well.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.660]   We start becoming resistant
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.220]   to the LH and FSH pulsatal surges.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.780]   So, the brain's like, "Hey, I told you
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.180]   "we need more estradiol."
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.020]   And the pituitary is like, "I sent the signal."
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.740]   And the brain's like, "Send more."
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.860]   So, we get much higher pulses of FSH.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.140]   And then finally, the ovary kind of, ugh,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.740]   is able to get that egg out, but sometimes it's delayed.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.900]   So, we have the timing of that monthly predictable cycle
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.780]   goes awry.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.740]   Sometimes the periods are closer together.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.740]   Sometimes they're further apart.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.460]   But also, the estrogen and progesterone levels
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.780]   start changing dramatically.
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.180]   We see much higher surges of estradiol
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.260]   than we ever had in our pre-productive years,
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.860]   and then much lower levels underneath.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.100]   So, we end up with this very volatile curve
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.580]   and not predictable at all.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.980]   We call it, in our world, the zone of chaos.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.700]   So, it is literal hormonal chaos.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.820]   What used to look like this, you know, every month,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.820]   is now just insane and very, very, very unpredictable.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.820]   That is why we don't have a good blood test
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.700]   in perimenopause to make the diagnosis.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.800]   Those of us in the menopause use symptoms,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.260]   usually, to make the diagnosis,
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.080]   and we rule out other conditions that might overlap.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.420]   So, perimenopause, basically, critical threshold.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:35.180]   It's a downward trend overall of estradiol,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.780]   but it is a very chaotic race
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.540]   till you flatline and bottom out.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:40.380]   - I see.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.980]   So, for those listening, your description
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.260]   of the kind of the amplitude of the estrogen surge,
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.180]   it gets much greater in this perimenopause phase.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.140]   You also mentioned that follicle-stimulating hormone,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.780]   which comes from the pituitary,
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.420]   has to be, or somehow is up-regulated in this phase
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.220]   because, I don't know, is it that the receptors for FSH
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.340]   are somehow not responsive?
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.700]   At the level of the ovary,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.820]   do we know what's happening to the ovary?
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.180]   Is it, obviously, the signal's getting there,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.300]   it's not effective,
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.980]   so then the brain is kicking out more FSH.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.820]   Is it that the ovary is somehow-
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.780]   - So, the egg quality is poor,
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.860]   and then around each germ cell is the thecaludian cells,
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.460]   which is actually where the estradiol,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.300]   the whole pathway going from, you know,
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.500]   actually testosterone's converted to estradiol.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.900]   So, that whole pathway, you know, it still will respond,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.220]   but the cells are just old, you know,
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.700]   is the way that it's been explained to me,
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.660]   and from what I've read.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.220]   I think we need a lot more research in this area
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.820]   because that is how we're going to help women,
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.820]   I think, longer term, is understanding that process better.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.060]   But, you know, all I learned in school 25 years ago
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.620]   was it's the transition to menopause, the end.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.020]   You know, the whole endocrinological process,
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.940]   I didn't learn until about two years ago.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.300]   - And my guess is, just based on my understanding
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.100]   of the only recent trend toward emphasizing studies
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.380]   of both female and male, even just mice and mouse models,
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.660]   which is where generally this stuff originates,
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.780]   and then it shifts into humans
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.980]   once certain targets are identified.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.500]   Only recently has the NIH insisted
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   that there be female mice in the studies of mice.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.340]   I mean, it's been a few years now,
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.180]   but that's a, you know,
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.180]   sex as a biological variable is actually a requirement
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.620]   in most grant applications,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.380]   unless, of course, there's a specific reason
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.580]   to study only one or the other sex of mice.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.660]   So you can imagine that the dearth of research in this area
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:38.660]   is due to a long desert of absence of studies
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.820]   into what is perimenopause.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.900]   So for women who are in the age range of perimenopause
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.960]   or who are thinking about this,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.020]   are there things that they can do
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.500]   in order to either upregulate the sensitivity of the ovary
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   to FSH or to somehow prolong this period of perimenopause?
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.900]   And I should also say,
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.780]   what are some reasons why they would want to do that?
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   You know, obviously this is part of the arc of maturation
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.800]   of the female reproductive axis,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.380]   but of course that alone is not a reason to not try and,
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.900]   I guess we say, optimize it for one's wellbeing.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.180]   - So we don't know.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.660]   When you, the best way I can highlight why we don't know
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.140]   or where the dollars are going for research,
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.820]   you know, we go to PubMed and you type in the word pregnancy,
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.740]   1.1 million articles come up.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.820]   Type in the word menopause, it's down to 97,000.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.660]   - Really?
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.260]   - You type in the word perimenopause,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.700]   and I checked this like two weeks ago,
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.300]   and it was like 6,400 and something.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.620]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.380]   - That is surprising.
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.820]   Or maybe it shouldn't be surprising
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.140]   given what we were just talking about in terms of-
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.340]   - So as far as like why those cells are becoming resistant
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.540]   and what's happening at the level of the receptor,
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.780]   I think we need a lot more research in this area.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.460]   I think it's starting to happen
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.180]   because women are realizing there's a demand now
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.660]   because the older you are when you go through menopause,
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.300]   the healthier you are for cardiometabolic disease.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.740]   It's the loss of estrogen
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.300]   that accelerates our path to those diseases.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.140]   - So are there clinical signs of perimenopause
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.300]   that either directly or indirectly relate
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.140]   to these bigger surges in FSH
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.620]   and these larger amplitude estrogen surges?
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.740]   - The two best documented and studied
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.060]   are mental health changes.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.220]   The brain does not like the chaos of,
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.660]   and the neurotransmitters are very, very sensitive
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.420]   to estrogen and progesterone and even testosterone.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.420]   And so we see aberrations in serotonin and norepinephrine
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.180]   and in dopamine as the levels start becoming chaotic.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.420]   So we have at least a 40% increase
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.260]   of mental health disorders
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.940]   and SSRI use doubles across the menopause transition,
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.660]   across perimenopause.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.460]   And now the data is showing that women
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.300]   who are given hormone therapy in their perimenopause
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.260]   have a lower incidence of new onset depression.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.300]   And now the neuroscientists are saying,
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   hey, for these women who are developing depression
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.620]   and perimenopause, giving them estrogen
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.460]   is better than an SSRI.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.340]   They're gonna have a better outcome.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.580]   - I think most people don't realize how rich the brain
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.540]   and rest of the nervous system are with hormone receptors,
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.380]   in particular, estrogen receptors,
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.400]   and as you mentioned, testosterone receptors as well,
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.520]   androgen receptors.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.260]   And the often direct relationship between estrogen
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.660]   and the neuromodulators such as serotonin, dopamine,
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.980]   epinephrine, acetylcholamide.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.820]   - GABA for progesterone.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.180]   - Yeah, it's interesting during neural development,
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.800]   which is where I started off,
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.180]   which was a neural embryonic development.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.660]   The hormones exert these widespread roles
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.140]   in defining even which neurons
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.820]   will express certain neurotransmitters.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.660]   And then somehow the field of neuroscience
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.300]   is only recently gotten on board.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.100]   The idea that this intimate relationship
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.980]   between hormones and neurotransmitters
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.340]   is something to consider
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.060]   in essentially every aspect of brain health.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.460]   Not just cognition, but maintenance of neurons
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.380]   and offsetting neurodegeneration and so on.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.400]   I mentioned that only so that people,
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.620]   I think, typically think of hormones as something,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.700]   sure, there's a signal from the brain,
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.920]   but that hormones are mostly of the body,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.500]   when in fact hormones play an absolutely crucial role
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.140]   within the brain.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.940]   - So you mentioned that during perimenopause
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.100]   there are symptoms that are, I guess,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.820]   are mainly reflected as shifts in mental health.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.820]   So is this women suddenly feeling kind of less optimistic?
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.740]   Is it like, what's the sort of constellation
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.060]   of psychological shifts that can occur?
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.660]   - So we see increasing anxiety.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.740]   We see definitely loss of executive functioning.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.620]   So new onset of ADD-type symptoms.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.740]   We see, of course, the cognitive,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.940]   what we call brain fog in lay terminology,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.620]   which is cognitive.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.240]   So they lose their words.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.420]   They're not able to do the calculations at work.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.660]   Like their executive functioning ability in their jobs
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.220]   is huge, like one in five women will quit their jobs
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.000]   because of menopause symptoms.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.420]   - That's an outrageous number.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.540]   - Yeah, and the economic impact is huge.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.380]   And so now companies are starting to get on board.
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.580]   And this is the time of our lives
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.940]   when the kids are grown for a lot of us,
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.340]   and we're ready to lean into our positions
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.380]   and really get into leadership.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.340]   We have all this experience, and now we can't,
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.700]   and now all of a sudden these,
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.660]   and their confidence is just wrecked.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.500]   And then the depression, and they're not sleeping,
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.460]   and it's this horrible feedback cycle that they end up in,
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.740]   that we end up in.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.980]   - Yeah, I wasn't aware that one in five is striking.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.180]   - That came out of the UK,
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.460]   but they're starting to crunch the numbers here in the US,
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.260]   and it's looking very similar.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.220]   - I know we're going to get into actionable tools later
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.260]   as it relates to menopause,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.220]   but as long as we're discussing this phase of perimenopause,
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.820]   what are some of the basic things
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.380]   that women could, A, pay attention to?
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.940]   We don't want to make people hypervigilant
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.580]   to the point of anxiety,
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.580]   but certainly given the frequency
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.000]   and given the implications,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.660]   it's important for them to pay attention to this phase.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.500]   And then some of the things that they can do to,
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.040]   either behaviorally or perhaps through other tools,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.140]   offset some of these changes.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.700]   - Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, which is abnormal periods.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.780]   So, and again, nothing's off the table.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.180]   It could be heavy periods, menorrhagia,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.960]   too frequent, too few, skipping.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.960]   It's really, really chaotic.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.260]   But a lot of women are suffering horribly
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.320]   from really debilitating periods,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.180]   either through the volume of blood loss,
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.340]   or they're having cramps,
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   and really, and so 90% of us will have that as a symptom.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.180]   Fatigue is a huge one.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.080]   A lot of them, the symptoms are kind of vague,
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.640]   and can be attributed to a lot of other things.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.720]   In our, in my, what we call the menopause chat group,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.320]   we have a lot of theories about a lot of conditions
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.500]   like fibromyalgia and the irritable bladder syndromes,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.720]   and that probably just perimenopause and menopause,
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.960]   and doctors didn't know how to make that diagnosis.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.700]   And so, musculoskeletal system takes a huge hit
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.540]   through the transition.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.520]   So all of a sudden, you have no injury,
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.600]   and you're having hip pain, joint pain, back pain,
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.920]   with, you go to the doctor and you get an X-ray,
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.760]   you do whatever, workup, and they can't find anything wrong.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.800]   Palpitations are huge.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.560]   It is a vasomotor symptom.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   So along with hot flashes, palpitations.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.120]   So a woman will walk into the emergency rooms
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.520]   sweating profusely, horrible palpitations.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.880]   She's anxiety, and they'll tell her
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.440]   she's having a panic attack.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.360]   You know, they'll work her up, you know,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.520]   everything's negative, and just say,
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.680]   well, it's a panic attack, go home.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.280]   And no one knew to connect the dots
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.440]   and figure out that this woman
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.800]   was in her menopause transition,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.880]   and this is how her body was expressing it.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.640]   It's complicated because we have sex hormone receptors,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.920]   as you do, in every organ system of our body,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.000]   and when these levels start going chaotic,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.160]   it can present in so many different ways.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   And so, when the patients come to me,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.560]   I'm doing blood work, not a lot of hormone levels,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.120]   'cause they're not super helpful,
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.800]   but I am doing thyroid workups, and autoimmune workups,
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.480]   and looking for nutritional deficiencies,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.360]   and anemia, and different things,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.560]   because I don't wanna miss those things
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.960]   and just pin everything on perimenopause.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.760]   - Are there lifestyle factors that can offset some of this?
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.320]   - It's not a perfect correlation,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.960]   but the healthier you are,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.240]   so anti-inflammatory diet, you know,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.120]   Mediterranean-esque, Galveston diet-esque,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.880]   you know, nutrition pattern, regular exercise,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.800]   good sleep habits, you know, all the pillars of health,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.000]   the healthier you are when you hit perimenopause,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.920]   the better the course is going to be for you.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.040]   They're looking at extending the life of the ovary
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.760]   with pharmacology.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.400]   We know what can shut it down faster.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.800]   So, we have kind of a genetic predetermined age
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.840]   of when you're gonna lose all your eggs,
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.960]   but we can speed that up.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.280]   So, if you smoke, you're gonna go through menopause sooner
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.040]   than your twin would have if she didn't smoke, okay?
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.360]   If you don't have children and you ovulate regularly,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.840]   then the more you ovulate,
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.440]   the faster you run through your egg supply, okay?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.600]   - Interesting, I wasn't aware of those data.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.240]   I don't know that most people are aware of those data.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.600]   - No, if you have a hysterectomy
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.560]   and you leave your ovaries behind,
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.640]   I didn't ever counsel my patients about this.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.500]   You lose four years off the life of your ovaries.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.840]   If you have a tubal ligation,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.320]   you usually lose a year and a half.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.720]   Huge genetic disparities.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.680]   So, African-Americans tend to go through
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.400]   a year and a half sooner,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.880]   and then there's Caucasians in the middle,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.360]   and then Asian family tend to go through later,
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   and they're not sure why, a year, two years.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.080]   So, if you have chemotherapy, if you have surgery,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.680]   if you have any inflammatory process in the abdomen,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.540]   irritable bowel, or endometriosis,
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.180]   you are going to lose some of the life of the ovary.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.020]   - You mentioned smoking.
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.240]   Are there any data on vaping?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.880]   - Not yet, I haven't seen any.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.480]   There might be out there, I just haven't seen it yet.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.840]   - No, I'm guessing if they're out there,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.880]   they're not prominent or you would have seen them.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.160]   I'm curious about vaping,
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.880]   because a lot of people are vaping instead of smoking,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.920]   and hopefully people are neither vaping nor smoking,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.320]   because it seems that, we had an expert on vaping
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.880]   on the podcast recently from Stanford,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.720]   and it seems that there's nothing great about it.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.520]   And there may be some things really bad about it.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.080]   But I was just curious, given that a number of young women,
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   and men, for that matter, are vaping nowadays,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.760]   and whereas smoking rates have gone way, way down.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   - Another 10 years before we'd be able to see
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.840]   when those women are going through menopause,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.880]   'cause vaping, I think vaping is younger,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.780]   the younger generation, like my kids.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.620]   They're friends--
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.460]   - People in their 20s and 30s.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.360]   - Tend to vape, so we're 20 years out
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.680]   from seeing how it's gonna affect them.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.720]   - Is there any evidence that alcohol
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.840]   can impact perimenopause? - I haven't seen any,
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.000]   but I can't imagine that heavy use of alcohol
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.360]   would prolong the life of the ovary in any way, so.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.480]   - And we know that any use of alcohol
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.880]   has some potential role in disrupting sleep.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.000]   - Oh, 100%. - Presumably,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   like everything else, if you disrupt sleep,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.520]   you disrupt things-- - Everything.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.680]   - For the worse in that, got it.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   So you mentioned rough ages for onset of menopause, 51,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.680]   but anywhere from 45 to 55,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:39.040]   and the perimenopause is defined as a period
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.600]   about seven years prior to that?
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   - Seven to 10, yeah. - Okay.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.540]   What's the earliest you've ever had a patient come in
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.960]   who entered menopause?
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.800]   What's the latest you've ever seen?
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.760]   - My personal patient, 27,
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.400]   she came in just a couple months ago.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.480]   So she had a special condition
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.280]   we call premature ovarian failure,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.520]   and she had found me on social media
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   and wanted to come just to make sure
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.800]   she was doing everything right.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.120]   And so early menopause is defined
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.880]   as between the ages of 40 and 45,
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.800]   and then premature menopause
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.360]   or premature ovarian insufficiency,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.000]   it's not a complete failure for most women,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.800]   but it is very, very low,
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.040]   is anytime before the age of 40.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.000]   So this patient kind of got kicked around for two years,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.240]   went to her doctor, no periods, horrible hot flashes.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.320]   Again, she was 25 and it was not on his radar,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.540]   and he never tested her for menopause,
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.840]   and it took her 18 months to get the diagnosis.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.400]   And so the longer your body is away from estrogen,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.760]   the higher the risk factor.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.080]   And it's been all over the news this week
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.800]   where we know that untreated premature ovarian insufficiency
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.660]   has an earlier death.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.520]   So they have higher cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.440]   all because estrogen is so protective
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.140]   and they have to go so long without it.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.440]   We can negate most of those risks
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.280]   by giving her aggressive hormone therapy early.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.160]   So she came in to make sure she was on the right dose
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.360]   because in premature ovarian failure,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.560]   we don't wanna give them menopause hormone therapy doses.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.400]   They're too low.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.560]   We wanna get her more like she would have,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.440]   which is three to four times the amount of estrogen
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.600]   as a reproductive aged woman.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.440]   And so, and she wanted to have a period
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.580]   so she would seem like her friends.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.280]   You know, it was an emotional thing for her,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.880]   which I totally respect.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.520]   And so we were doing cyclical progesterone for her
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.960]   so that she would have a withdrawal bleed
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.440]   and feel like she was normal.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.320]   - Basic question, but I'm curious, so I'll ask,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.680]   given that levels of estrogen change so much naturally
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.680]   during the course of the ovulation cycle, menstrual cycle,
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.220]   with estrogen therapy, is it a constant dose
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.720]   or it's modulated by week to week?
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   - Good question.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.680]   So there are some formulas.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.840]   So, and when we look at hormonal contraception,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.020]   so the biggest difference between contraceptive doses
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.840]   and menopause hormone therapy doses,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   they're both based in estrogen and progesterone mostly, okay?
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.120]   The hormone therapy was developed to stop a hot flash
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.000]   for decades.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   Menopause was defined by the presence or absence of,
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.800]   you know, severe menopause
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.680]   was defined by hot flashes or not.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.500]   They didn't, nothing else.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.640]   And so they developed the formulations
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.280]   with enough estrogen to stop hot flashes.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.520]   Birth control was developed to stop ovulation.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.060]   You don't ovulate, you don't get pregnant.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.720]   And it's, but the difference between low dose
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.440]   birth control pill and higher dose menopause hormone therapy
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   is not that far away.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.360]   And so that a lot of people don't understand.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.920]   Now, the types of estrogen we use in birth control
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   are a little bit different.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.120]   Most birth control is ethanol estradiol,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.320]   which is one of the synthetics.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.520]   We have literally millions and millions
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.480]   of women's year data on it.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.840]   We know it's safety profile.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.760]   I think we're not counseling patients adequately
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.640]   about birth control as far as what it does to their
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.880]   testosterone and what it can do to, you know,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.720]   oh, it's fine, it's safe.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.200]   I took it for years, but I think we need to do a better job
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.120]   as a specialty on counseling women.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.960]   But I do think it's a good medication.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.680]   And then on menopause hormone therapy, you know,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.040]   it's much lower dose.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.920]   It does not suppress ovulation.
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.960]   So in perimenopause, it's a little bit of the wild west,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.440]   which one we're gonna use.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.460]   How high do we wanna go?
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.920]   Do we need to suppress our ovulation
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.160]   because she's got acne or horrible periods or cramps
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.040]   or something where I wanna suppress
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.600]   that ovulation to help her?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.480]   Or can I give her menopause hormone therapy doses,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.280]   which in effect, think of the hypothalamus.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.080]   I'm giving her just enough estrogen to calm the brain down
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.800]   and tell them everything's okay.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.080]   We're not gonna get those big peaks and drops.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.720]   And if she still ovulates, that's okay too.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.560]   - As many of you know,
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.440]   I've been taking AG1 for more than 10 years now.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.920]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.680]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.800]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.200]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.920]   And I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.500]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.680]   about what proper nutrition is.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.640]   But here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.000]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.680]   a vegetarian or a vegan,
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.880]   I think it's generally agreed
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.400]   that you should get most of your food
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.420]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.920]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.520]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   probiotics and micronutrients
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.960]   that we all need for physical and mental health.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.720]   Now, I personally am an omnivore
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.280]   and I strive to get most of my food
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.080]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.060]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.680]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.400]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.240]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.520]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.200]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.440]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.480]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.120]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.760]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.800]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.960]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.160]   So while many supplements out there are really directed
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.520]   towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   AG1 is foundational nutrition
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.460]   designed to support all aspects of wellbeing
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.960]   related to mental health and physical health.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.360]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.800]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.240]   to claim a special offer.

[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:32.320]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.680]   - As long as we're on the topic of birth control,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.120]   earlier you mentioned that the IUD,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.480]   and presumably this is some form of the IUD,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.040]   not necessarily copper IUD,
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.360]   can disrupt or stop-
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.900]   - A period. - A period.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.140]   Maybe we could talk a little bit
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.520]   about the different forms of birth control.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:55.360]   IUD, the pill, quote unquote, old term,
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.840]   but I think most people know what we're referring to
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.280]   when we say that, the ring, and on and on.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.240]   What is your stance on these different forms
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.580]   of birth control as it relates to their safety?
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.480]   I guess about a year and a half ago,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.040]   I hosted a female physician guest on this podcast,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.400]   and both sides of the birth control issue
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.240]   were touched on it.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.360]   One, the relationship to potential inhibition
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.880]   of certain forms of cancers,
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.400]   but then also the potential for certain side effects,
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.440]   maybe even cancers.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.040]   And so it seems like it can play out both ways,
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.240]   and this is a very heated topic.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.360]   In fact, so much so that I learned
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.320]   that if one is going to post a clip of any of this
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.680]   on social media,
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.960]   it almost makes sense to have them in the same post,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.240]   because we actually did both of them.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.400]   We did a post where it was more about
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.760]   the pros of birth control
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.640]   and then the cons of birth control.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   As stated through the words of this very same clinician.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.800]   So we will be sure to,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.640]   so for anyone listening,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.440]   whichever answer comes first,
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.280]   stay tuned for the next answer,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.880]   because my understanding is that
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.560]   it's not a black and white issue.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.680]   - I think the best form of birth control is a vasectomy.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.760]   And so much of contraception is dumped in a female's lap,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.720]   you know, in a committed relationship.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.520]   And I can't tell you the comments I've heard
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.080]   when a patient comes to me
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.760]   and she wants to get X, Y, and Z
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.680]   simply for contraception.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.240]   She's absolutely perfectly healthy.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.280]   There's nothing wrong with her.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.120]   She just doesn't want to be pregnant.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.000]   And I'm like, okay, you're done.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.040]   You know, she's completed her family.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.560]   She's out, you know?
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.160]   And I'm like, tell your partner to get a vasectomy
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.360]   or he won't do that.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.200]   You know?
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.960]   So now all of the risk and the onus goes on her.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.920]   And so we go through the options of surgical,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.800]   like, you know, tubal ligation,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.840]   which is basically blocking the tube.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.560]   So when I, you know, talk to my teenagers,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.000]   I'm like, here's how you not get pregnant.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:51.960]   A, you don't have sex.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   Well, if that's not an option,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.560]   then we have to either block the sperm,
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.880]   stop the egg from coming out
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.560]   or stop the place where they communicate,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.640]   which is the fallopian tube.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.160]   And so when we look at the different forms
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.440]   of hormonal contraception,
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   which are meant to stop ovulation, suppress ovulation,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   because they're telling the brain,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.400]   we have enough estrogen and progesterone on board,
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.880]   quiet down so it doesn't send those signals to the ovary.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.720]   Right?
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.720]   And so that can come in a pill form, a patch form,
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.560]   a ring form,
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.240]   and they each have their own pros, cons, risks, benefits.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.840]   You know, transdermal has less risk of blood clots
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.200]   versus oral has a higher risk of blood clot
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.640]   in any form of estrogen.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.560]   So we talk about that.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.680]   We look at their family history,
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.280]   or if they have MTHFR or any of the clotting genes,
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:36.400]   you know, then we counsel directly versus the IUD.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:40.960]   The IUDs create an inflammatory environment in the uterus
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.080]   that blocks and it creates a plug in the cervix
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.600]   so that the sperm can't get through.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.480]   And then if any do get through,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.160]   it's a toxic environment in the uterine cavity for the sperm.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.640]   So that's really how those IUDs work.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.440]   Some IUDs are coated with progesterone or progestin,
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.040]   not progesterone, progestogen,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.240]   and those end up decidualizing the endometrium,
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.440]   so thinning that lining from that constant progesterone
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.880]   to the point where you stop bleeding.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.520]   So a lot of my patients really loved that option
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.680]   of being amenorrheic, no periods,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.040]   just for the convenience of it,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.720]   but they were still ovulating in the background.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.800]   So we're not suppressing their natural cycles,
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.200]   just their periods.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.040]   - I see.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.240]   And is there any evidence
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.520]   that the use of any form of birth control
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   can disrupt the timing or the availability of,
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.600]   I realize availability of eggs is a very clinically naive,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.760]   biologically naive statement,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.080]   but basically what I'm saying,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.960]   can any of them accelerate the onset of perimenopause?
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.800]   Can they delay the onset of perimenopause?
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.960]   - They will delay the onset a little bit.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.680]   You know, it's maybe a year.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.520]   If you use it for a long time from what the data shows.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.640]   So women who suppress ovulation,
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.440]   we lose about 11,000 eggs each month
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.960]   with the ovulation process to get one out.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.320]   11,000 race to the finish line and only one makes it,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.440]   but we lose about 11,000 in the process.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.400]   So women who are constantly, you know,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.680]   for a long time suppressing ovulation
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.840]   will have a slightly older age of menopause
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.440]   had they not done that.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   - When you say slightly older,
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.040]   what's the longest extension of sort of-
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.680]   - The best I could see in the data was maybe nine months.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.320]   - Okay, from nine months use of birth control?
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.960]   - No, no, no, so maybe like five to 10 year use.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.280]   I have to look at the data again to be, you know,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.860]   I'd have to look that one up, but it was several years.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:29.700]   - Got it.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.600]   - To gain an extra maybe nine months,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.560]   maybe a year of ovarian life.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.400]   - I see.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.280]   And nowadays, at least if people have the means,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.040]   there's some trend, if you will,
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   toward freezing one's eggs.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.800]   This might be a good opportunity to just state
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.000]   something that came up before
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.640]   when we had Dr. Natalie Crawford on the podcast
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.300]   to talk about female fertility.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:00.400]   I think surprising to many people was her statement that,
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.440]   not because it's controversial,
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.280]   but because we just don't hear this often enough,
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.760]   that harvesting eggs for freezing or for IVF
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.120]   does not diminish the pool of eggs
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.720]   that one would have,
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.640]   meaning you're losing them each month anyway.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   - Yeah, and so they're only pulling out 10, 12 maybe
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.240]   in a cycle, and when you're losing 11,000 with an ovulation,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.080]   so it really isn't going to affect
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.840]   when you go through menopause.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.440]   - Such a crucial thing for people to hear.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.120]   I think there were a number of comments
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.280]   when we posted that clip on social media,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.960]   and people, women saying, wow, I didn't realize
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.960]   that harvesting eggs would not somehow
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.600]   shift the onset of menopause earlier.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.600]   And so for the record, we are not saying that.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.400]   We're saying that it does not.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.200]   And very interesting that the use of birth control,
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.320]   but I'm guessing only forms of birth control
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.720]   that suppress ovulation can delay the onset
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.520]   of perimenopause menopause by about nine months maximum.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.320]   So things like the copper IUD.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.160]   - That won't affect it.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.280]   - Right, which prevent pregnancy
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.900]   by creating a unfavorable environment for the sperm
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.080]   rather than disrupting ovulation in any way,
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.100]   will not presumably extend perimenopause menopause.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.540]   Okay, just wanna make sure we're crystal clear for people.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.340]   You're being very clear, but I wanna make sure
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.680]   that I'm clear on it and then reiterate
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:27.800]   because this can be kind of tricky territory.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.920]   I think there are a lot of assumptions about this stuff,
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.640]   and there's a lot of lore out there.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.480]   Why do you think that is?
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.400]   Is that because of the lack of solid research
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.840]   and communication in this area?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.880]   - I think so.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   - Or is it something else?
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.920]   You know, I think that these are tricky topics
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.400]   for discussion often because we hear all this stuff
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.920]   like birth control pills disrupt one's ability
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.960]   to get pregnant when they come off,
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.820]   or we just learned that it can delay
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.000]   the onset of perimenopause,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.440]   which by extension means there's a greater window
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.400]   for pregnancy if one thinks about it that way.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   But why do you think it's such a tangled discussion
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.960]   out there?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   - I think just the way that society views pregnancy
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.460]   and female health and, you know,
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.660]   at least, you know, I live on the internet now.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.600]   You know, this new life has brought me life on the internet
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.940]   and that's what the algorithms are showing me.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.600]   - It's a very friendly, everyone's written on it.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.920]   - Everyone loves you.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.240]   - It's a great, listen, it's what you're doing
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.760]   is so important.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.180]   And I understand the statement behind that statement.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.360]   I think, but it's so important
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.920]   because people are getting the opportunity to learn
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.880]   about really critical public health
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.500]   and female health issues in a way
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.320]   that just was inaccessible before.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.520]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.800]   And it's good and bad.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.600]   You know, there's a lot of lore and misinformation
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.740]   that's getting propagated.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.440]   And I feel like as a specialty,
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.680]   you know, as a women's health specialist,
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.080]   we did this to ourselves.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.640]   You know, we have not properly educated ourselves.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.820]   We have not spent the money, the research,
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.620]   really, you know, championed women after reproduction.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.760]   When you look at the dollars and the research
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.360]   and where it goes in women's health,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.120]   I mean, women's health just gets a little sliver
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.760]   of all the NIH funding.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.320]   When you look at all NIH funding and what goes to menopause,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.920]   it's 0.03%, less than half a percent.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.640]   This is one third of a woman's life.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.360]   And when you look at, God, McKinsey and company
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   just published a report where they pulled 680 women
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.280]   and 80 studies on like chronic diseases,
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.600]   diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.000]   And they looked at how they had,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.560]   they were women included in the studies,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:45.280]   but how many presented the data for the different sexes.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.120]   Like what happened to men versus what happened to women?
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.760]   It was only 50% of the articles
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   actually did sex-specific differences
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.520]   and how this medication affected this process or whatever.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.960]   And then of the ones that did,
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.760]   30% were women had poorer outcomes.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.400]   And on the flip side, 10% of men had poorer outcomes.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.600]   And these things aren't just being brought to light.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.320]   So the lack of recognition of sex-specific differences
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.960]   in chronic disease and how menopause
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.120]   kind of plays into all that,
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.200]   I think is where the future needs to go.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.700]   So we deserve as much good health as everyone else.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.840]   'Cause yes, we're living longer than men,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.600]   but 20 to 25% of that life is in poorer health.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.960]   - Wow, that's a really significant statement.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.480]   I mean, I think that the National Institutes of Health
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:34.200]   has been terrific in establishing new institutes within it.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.000]   They even have a complementary health institute now.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.200]   There's the National Eye Institute.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.020]   There's Cancer here.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.440]   Is there a plan or one would hope
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.200]   for a dedicated institute for women's health?
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.400]   - Push.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.040]   So there was one piece of legislation
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.320]   that got pushed through, the Biden signed it,
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.120]   and it was $100 million for women's health.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.000]   And that got chopped up very quickly.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.640]   Menopause did get a little piece of it
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.000]   because we're also really struggling with endometriosis
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.360]   and a lot of the female-specific uterine diseases
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.080]   and PCOS and things.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.420]   And so we need more funding there as well.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.920]   And then there's another bill that just got,
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.640]   that's the one Halle Berry was on TV talking about,
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.560]   another bill for $250 million.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.900]   That bill includes language for education of providers.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.080]   So we have a whole generation of providers.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.040]   Like I graduated my residency training
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.000]   the year the WHI came out.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.320]   So all, we had very little
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.520]   like real clinically significant menopause education.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.200]   And then we knew about HRT and we were giving it in clinic
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.540]   if she was coming in with severe hot flashes.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.560]   But that got taken off the table after the WHI.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.640]   And then we have a whole generation,
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.400]   like all menopause education basically stopped after that.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.120]   - So WHI, Women's Health Initiative, HRT.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.440]   No, that's okay, just so that people are on board.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.040]   Hormone Replacement Therapy.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.840]   Yeah, it's a, well, we can encourage the expansion
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.060]   of research in these areas and with this discussion.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.380]   And certainly I was on NIH panels for years
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.360]   as a regular member in the Eye Institute.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.080]   And what I've noticed with NIH
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.200]   is that they are very responsive to the public call
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.080]   for growth of research in particular areas.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.740]   You know, it can take time, it's government after all,
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.580]   and they need funding.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.720]   There's a finite amount of funding,
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.880]   but I think that rarely do I ever get
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.500]   into legislature-based things.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.340]   But if you are somebody who cares about more funding
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.480]   in a given area of research,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.440]   it's actually very straightforward what to do.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.560]   You call your congressman or senator and you tell them,
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:45.780]   literally you leave a message.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.880]   I find this kind of interesting.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.080]   And so it's kind of like what we learned in social studies
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.240]   and in elementary school.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.380]   But you call your senator or your governor
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.880]   and you leave a message and you say,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.960]   "Hey, you know, there's this issue
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.420]   "that impacts a ton of people and it's really important.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.200]   "And the next time it comes up
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.060]   "when budgeting comes up in Washington,
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.120]   "it's really important.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.200]   "And if you hear about a bill,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.720]   "you can call and support a bill."
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.560]   And believe it or not,
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.720]   some of that stuff actually translates
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.080]   to more funding in a given area.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.920]   In fact, the BRAIN Initiative,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.840]   which unfortunately had its budget
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.080]   cut significantly recently,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.200]   maybe put that funding back,
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.800]   but arose from the,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.480]   I believe it was the child of two neuroscience professors
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.960]   up at University of Wisconsin.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:35.320]   I'm probably gonna get some details wrong,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.240]   but so the Khalil's are the professors, as I recall.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.560]   And their son overheard all of these conversations
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.140]   growing up about the importance of brain science.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.500]   And then eventually pushed through government channels
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.160]   for more money for brain research.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.120]   And then we had a long phase of pretty,
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.720]   pretty substantial research and then it was cut.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.640]   So these things, but it persists.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.160]   And so these things really matter.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.080]   - They do. - Like you can impact it.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.800]   So, and maybe we should send them a clip
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.060]   of your statements on this podcast.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:05.160]   Getting back to kind of things that people can control.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.520]   So for people who are heading into perimenopause
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.560]   or who are in the perimenopause phase,
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.480]   aside from the typical things that we hear about,
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.600]   fortunately a lot these days,
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.120]   like getting adequate sleep, getting exercise, nutrition.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.440]   Maybe we could touch a little bit on nutrition in a moment.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.320]   You mentioned Mediterranean diet, Galveston diet,
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.520]   things that are going to promote overall health.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.740]   Are there any things that people can do,
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.840]   maybe even take that would improve
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.120]   their outcomes in this phase?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.520]   Like I've heard of people and I have no bias here
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.040]   or even knowledge of the research on this.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.800]   If there is any people taking, for instance,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.360]   grapeseed extract or people trying to do a number of things
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.560]   to reduce inflammation,
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.520]   kind of general themes around self-care
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.760]   and wellness these days.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.160]   But what are sort of the five or six that come to mind,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.800]   perhaps as like the things that can move the levers
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.680]   in the right direction?
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.480]   - What I would tell my 35 year old self,
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:01.800]   who just kind of went into this obliviously.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.640]   And what I know now is your diet
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.340]   is probably one of the most important things
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.600]   that determines your level of inflammation.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.720]   And then estrogen is a really powerful
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:14.080]   anti-inflammatory hormone.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.360]   And we lose that protection when we go through,
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.200]   we start losing it through the transition.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.560]   So whatever you can do in the other areas,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.660]   especially with nutrition, sleep, stress reduction,
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.500]   we need to do it.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.640]   So fiber, we are not getting enough fiber in our diet.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.400]   In the Western diet, I think it's most women
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.040]   are getting 10 to 12 grams per day.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.360]   And we need at least 25 and the health benefits
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.740]   tend to max out around 30, 32 grams per day.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.080]   So focusing on foods that are rich in fiber.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.600]   Fibers feed in the gut microbiome,
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.440]   slowing down glucose absorption,
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.540]   glucose levels, sugar absorption into the bloodstream.
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:49.240]   It is slowing down the rate of certain parts of transit
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.920]   and pulling more water into the gut.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.560]   There's nothing bad about it, right?
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.000]   The foods that are rich in fiber
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.040]   have a lot of other stuff that's good for you too.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.520]   Cofactors, vitamins, minerals, nutrients,
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.860]   they're just so helpful.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.040]   And then anthocyanins, just find things that crunch
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.960]   and get as many colors as you can.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.160]   Green, red, purple, yellow,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.560]   every color represents a phytochemical
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.880]   that is going to be good for you
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.360]   in different areas of your body
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.480]   and try to keep it as varied as possible.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.680]   We're not getting enough protein.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.840]   And I have to thank Dr. Gabrielle Lyon,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.600]   really helping me focus in on that.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.560]   When I first wrote Galveston Diet,
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.120]   to be honest and transparent, it was for weight loss.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.960]   And I was frustrated with my weight gain
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.040]   and that was the pain point my patients had
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.240]   and that was my pain point,
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.920]   but I didn't realize it represented something
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.040]   much more sinister than just the way it looked,
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.560]   the visceral fat gain.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.760]   And so learning about visceral fat
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.840]   and what it really means.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.060]   And that is, for your listeners,
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.240]   the fat that wraps around our internal organs.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.920]   It's a very different fat than the subcutaneous fat.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   And a pre-menopausal woman, so we age matched
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.320]   and looked at visceral fat levels,
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.860]   measuring it with the DEXA scanners,
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.680]   you have about 8% of your fat is visceral
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.020]   as a pre-menopausal person.
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:05.320]   And then when you go through the transition, it's 23%.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.680]   With no changes in diet and exercise.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.280]   - The visceral fat is not something
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.520]   that gets enough attention.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.400]   I think everyone thinks about subcutaneous fat
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.240]   because of its relationship to aesthetics.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.700]   - It's cosmetically distressing, but really, yeah.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.440]   - And one doesn't want too much of it
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.800]   for health reasons either,
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.120]   but it's the intravisceral fat that,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.160]   at least by my understanding,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.760]   is really the most problematic for our health.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.120]   - It's a harbinger of chronic disease, so.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.020]   - I read that weight gain is one of the primary symptoms
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.360]   of menopause itself.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.240]   - Yeah, so you have to be careful how you think about that.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   When we plot weight gain versus age,
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.520]   it's a very straightforward linear curve,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.600]   and menopause does not seem to affect that.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.560]   What is happening is a body composition change.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:55.560]   We are losing muscle and we are gaining visceral fat.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.220]   And you might be gaining some subcutaneous fat,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.380]   but those are kind of the key things that are happening.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.120]   And so that's really, when I'm counseling patients,
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.020]   what I'm focusing on.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.740]   'Cause I have a body scanner in my office
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.480]   where I can tell them what their level of visceral fat
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.360]   is in their muscle mass.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.840]   And so we, bone and muscle,
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.540]   that musculoskeletal unit works together.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.400]   And so we see this acceleration of muscle loss,
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.340]   which controls our basal metabolic rate,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   which determines our resistance to insulin, which, you know.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:26.200]   So it's just, that's the organ of longevity.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.600]   That's what I've learned from Dr. Lyon, you know.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.240]   And everything we can do to hang on to it
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:33.300]   and build is so important.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.640]   So protein, going back to the original point,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.440]   protein intake is key.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.880]   And women, by and large,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.040]   are getting 50 to 60 grams of protein per day.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.860]   And we really probably need 80, 100, 120,
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.760]   depending on our body composition.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.700]   - Yeah, thanks for mentioning Dr. Gabrielle Lyon.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.520]   She's doing what I view as just-
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.480]   - Beautiful work in the world.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.960]   - Yeah, terrific work, really promoting women's health
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.920]   and health generally.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   I know she's now, I believe it's exploring
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.240]   advanced training in urology for males as well.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   And so, you know, it's only fair to credit her
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.100]   with really expanding into these different areas,
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:15.900]   but especially this idea that we need,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.960]   and women perhaps in particular,
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.480]   from what I understand, she'll be on the podcast soon,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.960]   so we'll get more of an understanding,
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.920]   at least one gram of quality protein per pound
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.600]   of lean body mass, maybe even per pound of body weight
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.960]   per day in order to optimize their health.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.800]   - Yeah, she's definitely on the higher end.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.080]   You know, the WHO, the Women's Health Initiative,
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:38.600]   some of my favorite data, you know, it's not all bad,
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.360]   it's data, and was looking at frailty scores
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.040]   and protein intake in women.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.640]   And what they found was women who were having 1.5 to 1.7.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.200]   So basically, it was the higher their protein intake,
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.920]   the less likely they were to be frail, the end.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.800]   And it was, you know, they were reaching,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.080]   it was kind of peaking out somewhere around 1.5 to 1.7
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.480]   grams for kilogram of lean body mass.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.720]   And most women are getting around,
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.520]   you know, the FDA recommends 0.8.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.040]   - Wow, and source of protein also important, high quality.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.320]   - Right, right, you need all the amino acids, yeah.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.940]   - Very interesting.
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.480]   Now that's in menopause, but presumably also-
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.000]   - So starting those habits in peri,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.580]   just getting that laid down and getting those habits
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.040]   laid down are gonna set you up for a much better
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.720]   post-menopause, a much healthier post-menopause.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.120]   And we have to stop defining menopause
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.960]   by your hot flashes, you know.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.800]   It may or may not make your hot flashes better.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.820]   And we have great medications for that if it's disruptive.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:42.320]   But I'm talking about your cardiometabolic disease risk.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.360]   - I meant to ask this earlier.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.780]   So forgive me for leaping back briefly,
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.920]   but is there any value in knowing the age at which
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.800]   your mother went into menopause as a metric
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.680]   or a sensor rather, or as a window into whether or not
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.600]   you will go into menopause at more or less the same age?
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:04.560]   - Yes, there is a, of course, it's not one-to-one.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.520]   We get half of our DNA from our fathers.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:10.880]   So, but I always ask, and there is a, you know,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.520]   the latest data that looked at it,
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.400]   genetics is the biggest factor that determines
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.600]   when you're gonna go through menopause.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.020]   So knowing when your mothers, your aunts, you know,
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.440]   went through and if there were any medical conditions
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.440]   associated with that is huge.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.480]   - Okay, so now we're talking not so much
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   about perimenopause, but also menopause itself.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.800]   What is the typical constellation of symptoms
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   as one enters menopause, like right at the beginning,
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.440]   and then does that constellation of symptoms change
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   as one is, you know, a year, two years,
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.280]   three years into menopause?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.800]   - So it's almost a hundred percent
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.560]   with body composition changes, like very, very close.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.920]   You know, that visceral fat is tough to beat.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.560]   It's beatable, but it takes a lot of work, you know.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.280]   - Do people know if they have visceral fat?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.960]   I mean, there's their scanning approaches to look at it.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.520]   - You know, of course the gold standard is a DEXA
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.840]   or even an MRI, but no one can afford that.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.280]   So we have, like what I have in my office
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   is the in-body scanner.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.840]   So it's electrical impedance scanner, and it's pretty good.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.720]   - So you stand on the scale, hold the handles.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.520]   - I have the medical, I have the highest grade one
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.360]   for my patients.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.020]   And most people doing what I do, you know,
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.760]   utilizing a body scanner, use that one.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.520]   But you can use the waist-tip ratio.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.280]   And so the waist-tip ratio is a better measure
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.440]   of your risk of metabolic health
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.400]   than your weight or your BMI.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.480]   So it's so simple.
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.120]   You take a tape measure and a calculator,
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:32.960]   you can do it in your head,
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.200]   but you measure the smallest part of your waist.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.160]   And if you don't have a small waist, if it goes out,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.120]   then just use your belly button.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.200]   Just use something you can measure again.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.840]   - Are people sucking in or are they relaxed?
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   - You should be relaxed.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.560]   And I tell my patients, you know,
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:46.320]   do it first thing in the morning when your bladder's empty
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.480]   and you're not bloated and, you know,
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.120]   and then the widest part of your hips.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.360]   It's not perfect,
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.800]   but it's better than your weight or your BMI.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.440]   - So widest part of the hips with people,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.840]   feet parallel, standing up straight.
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.320]   'Cause people are gonna go try this, right?
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.380]   - And so I only know the data for women, so forgive me,
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.380]   but for a female, if it's less than 0.7,
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.520]   then your chance of having clinically significant
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.800]   aberrations in visceral fat are low.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.400]   And then if it's greater than one,
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.760]   you likely have higher levels of visceral fat.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.280]   And so in clinic or when I was coaching online
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.160]   for Galveston Diet, we were using the waist-up ratio
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.360]   as one of the, you know, measures for their success.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.840]   - When measuring the waist, which point along the waist?
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.020]   Is it right at the navel?
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:35.860]   Is it-
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.360]   - It's just wherever you're smallest.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.500]   So that's kind of different for different women.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.060]   So I would just say, look in the mirror,
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.560]   wherever your hourglass goes in
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.520]   is where you wanna kind of stick to.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.440]   But if you don't have that kind of a waist
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.600]   and you have a wider waist, just pick the belly button
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.760]   'cause you always know you can go back to that level.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.280]   You know, that's 'cause we're tracking them over time.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.480]   - Great, those are very useful recommendations.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.720]   And how often should people do that?
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:02.680]   - You know, you should never weigh yourself every day.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.520]   You shouldn't do this every day.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.120]   We were having patients do it or, you know,
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.920]   our followers do it once a month.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.280]   - So changes in body composition as measured by DEXA
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:14.200]   or impedance, or if you don't have access to that,
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.600]   waist to hip ratio,
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.120]   what are some of the other symptoms of menopause?
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.520]   - Fatigue, fatigue, multiple causes for the fatigue.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.280]   A lot of sleep disruption.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   Sleep disruption is another huge thing.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.640]   So all of a sudden you're struggling to go to sleep
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.560]   or you're having middle of the night awakens
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.080]   and not able to go back to bed.
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.400]   - That are new and different from previous-
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.160]   - New and different than before, right.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.000]   - I see.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.640]   - There was a recent study that came out
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.960]   and most of my patients in hindsight say,
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.080]   I knew something wasn't right
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.040]   or something was different, something had changed,
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.480]   but I couldn't put my finger on it.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.040]   And they're just had a study come out saying something's,
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.440]   when they looked at what that means,
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.240]   what does I'm not feeling like myself mean?
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.200]   And it was psychological changes.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.760]   So you lose resilience.
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.920]   You're suddenly more irritable.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.120]   You're suddenly not able to like go with the punches
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   or do, you know, you're not adjusting as well to change
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.960]   that you used to.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.160]   You're snapping at your kids more, your partner,
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.240]   or you're, you know, you're getting frustrated at work.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.760]   You know, it's just very kind of subtle
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.440]   and it takes going through it and then looking back to say,
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.480]   yeah, I really say maybe about 47
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.360]   that something was changing
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.480]   and I just thought I was just stressed out or whatever.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.400]   And then now I can see
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.200]   that was the beginning of the pattern.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.560]   So menstrual changes, as we talked about,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.640]   you know, the big highlights, vertigo,
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.800]   tinnitus ringing in the ears,
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.960]   skin changes.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.440]   So dry skin, itchy skin,
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.080]   feeling like you're having crawling under the skin,
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.160]   big gut changes.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.440]   So new onset bloating,
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.800]   you're kind of eating all the same things
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.440]   and your gut's just not handling things like it used to.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.800]   So the Zoe nutrition study took 1100 women
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:53.160]   and did stool samples through menopause,
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.480]   through the perimenopause-menopause transition
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.160]   and saw the changes in the gut microbiome
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.040]   from the loss of the sex hormones.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.880]   And basically we went from what a typical female microbiome
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.000]   to that of a male through the transition.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.160]   - Is there any direct evidence
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.440]   that supplementing the gut microbiome,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.800]   and here I don't necessarily mean pills and powders.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.200]   I mean, my understanding is that getting enough fiber
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.000]   and low sugar fermented foods
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.800]   can also support the gut microbiome.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.800]   Things like sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir, miso.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.600]   - Plain yogurt, just straight up, nothing added.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.880]   - Yeah, so is there evidence
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.320]   that supporting the gut microbiome
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.720]   can make this stage of menopause more,
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.400]   I guess, reduce some of the symptoms of menopause?
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.360]   - So the best I could find was,
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.000]   most of them are done with supplements
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.120]   'cause those are easier to measure
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.560]   than handing someone a cup of yogurt.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.680]   - Right, and you know which bacteria you're providing.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.760]   - So they did lactobacillus
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.360]   and looked and bifidobacterium, I think,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   and saw that women who were obese
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.240]   and hypertensive and menopausal,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.400]   and they had visceral fat decrease
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.560]   and blood pressure improvements versus placebo.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.320]   Also, it's hard to do placebo studies with food.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.300]   - Right.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.560]   - But they do, and then in the retrospective studies,
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.840]   they can look at dietary patterns.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.380]   And women who ate rich foods fermented
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:20.080]   and lots of yogurt, Mediterranean-type diets,
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.480]   have better symptoms overall.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.760]   - What's the difference between the Mediterranean diet
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.920]   and the Galveston diet?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   - So when I, so I got my culinary medicine certification.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.000]   I was frustrated-- - Culinary medicine.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.840]   - Yeah, so I was frustrated when I was working
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.640]   because I didn't know anything about nutrition,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.440]   and suddenly everything I was trying to tell my patients
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.880]   was based on the one lecture I got in medical school.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.480]   And good nutrition was like porn.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.680]   You know it when you see it,
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.280]   the Supreme Court definition of pornography.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.000]   And so the best I'd ever gotten
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.920]   was the gestational diabetic diet,
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.080]   and it was this Xerox things with,
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.440]   I was in the deep, I was in Texas,
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:59.200]   so it had tortillas and stuff on it,
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.320]   and it had been copied so many times
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.600]   you could barely read it anymore,
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   and that was the diet.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:06.780]   That was the only nutrition I'd ever hand it to a patient.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.480]   And so I'm like, "Eat healthy."
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.820]   And so I'm like, "I gotta do better than this.
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:10.960]   "I don't know enough."
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   And so we had a guest speaker for Alpha Omega Alpha,
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.520]   which is the Honor Society for medical school,
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.080]   and I was one of the advisors.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.780]   And it was this guy, Tim Harlan,
[00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:22.800]   who had started this culinary medicine movement,
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.080]   and it was basically nutrition for doctors.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.640]   And he developed this online program,
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.240]   and I had to go to New Orleans for a lab
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.360]   and San Antonio for a lab
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.080]   and work in kitchens where you were learning
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.600]   how to counsel patients, how to cook,
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:37.360]   and also basically getting a little minor in nutrition.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.680]   So it was the best thing I've ever done.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.520]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, very cool.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.000]   - I mean, I learned about allergies and all this stuff,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.600]   food allergies and things that I just didn't know,
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.360]   and just basic nutritional principles,
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.240]   like what it takes to build a healthy body,
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.400]   and I knew about kwashiorkor and severe deficiencies,
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.760]   but not good basic nutrition.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:57.380]   And so they talked heavily about Mediterranean.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.720]   They talked a lot about the fad diets and stuff,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.440]   but the principles of the Mediterranean.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.720]   I was like, I wanna teach this to my patients,
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.320]   but they're not gonna eat a lot of Greek yogurt,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.620]   or they're probably not gonna eat a lot of feta.
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.320]   How can I kind of take these blocks
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.640]   and make it more Americanized?
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.320]   So that was kind of like the brainchild for me
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.480]   around Galveston Diet was, let me create something.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.480]   And I really was into fasting at the time too.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.920]   So I was like, let me put this fasting thing together
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.320]   with good nutritional anti-inflammatory principles
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.360]   and talk about the things we know
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.880]   or probably you should not have in a whole lot
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.200]   of processed foods and high sugars and stuff,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.560]   and explain it in a way
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.880]   and how it's affecting their menopause
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.480]   and how can she approach her nutrition?
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.960]   And that's how Galveston Diet was born.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.000]   It was for my patients,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.880]   and then I gave it to my girlfriends,
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.520]   and then they started sharing it,
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.840]   and I talked about it one day on Facebook,
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.120]   and the world exploded.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:44.960]   - In the best way.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.200]   - In the best way, yeah.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.040]   It led me here.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.800]   - Right, right, and we all benefit.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.320]   What is the evidence that fasting can be beneficial
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.760]   or detrimental to perimenopause and menopause?
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.440]   - So the jury's kind of still out on that one.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.440]   I really liked the data that, I think it was Mark Mattson
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.760]   had done on neurodegenerative disease
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.240]   and using fasting as a tool there
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.520]   and lowering inflammation levels.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.120]   So I was like, this is amazing, this is great,
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.480]   because so much about menopause is pro-inflammatory.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.680]   - Is this intermittent fasting, so time-restricted feeding?
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.500]   - Intermittent fasting, yeah.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.480]   So he was basically doing 16/8,
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.360]   and very scheduled intermittent fasting.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.080]   And so that was something I was coaching my followers about,
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.400]   consider this, try this,
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.960]   this might be something to help lower inflammation.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.240]   I pulled back on that,
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.920]   because it's really hard to get enough protein in
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.280]   for a lot of women, especially if they came in at 60,
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.840]   and now I'm telling them to double their protein,
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.600]   and then giving them an eight-hour window to do it.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.520]   They're like, I'm walking around
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.640]   gnawing on a chicken breast all day.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.480]   This is hard.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.240]   - Right, and metabolizing protein is its own work.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   - Right, and so you have to spread it out
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.480]   throughout the day.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.840]   And a lot of that work was done at UTMB,
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.120]   where I did my residency, and where I taught for years.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.280]   And so I was friendly with the nutrition department there.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.120]   I was getting all excited about everything.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.080]   And they were like, I went to several of their conferences,
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.720]   and talking about breaking up protein intake
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.440]   into nuggets throughout the day,
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.920]   'cause most women have very little protein with breakfast,
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.400]   maybe wheat gluten in their toast,
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400]   and then have a little bit at lunch,
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.880]   and then stack their protein at night,
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.280]   and they're still not getting enough,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   but they're overdoing it in their evening meal,
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.680]   that's their big protein meal.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.320]   And so, like teaching them to kind of,
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.880]   you know, what I was teaching in Galveston Diet
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   was you need to have a healthy fat,
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.160]   a good healthy carb, and a protein
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.400]   with every meal and snack that you eat, you know?
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.560]   - Why do you think that protein
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.440]   has not been emphasized enough until recently?
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.640]   - I think because we didn't understand it.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.920]   You know, we didn't understand how important muscle was,
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.600]   and I mean, we knew that protein intake
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.640]   was important for muscle,
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.400]   but muscle was for bodybuilders and not for women.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.440]   I lived my whole life up until about five years ago,
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.280]   eating to be thin and moving to be thin.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.080]   That thin was the only measurement of health
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.440]   that I needed to worry about.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.880]   And what I did was chip away at my bone and muscle strength,
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.320]   and thank God I don't have osteopenia yet.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.160]   You know, I've hopefully have reversed
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.260]   whatever trend I was on, and I'm naturally low muscle,
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.160]   so now it's just a battle to try to hang on
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.440]   to what little I have and build some.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.200]   - And you resistance train.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.800]   Now, now. - Three days a week.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.320]   Three days a week. - Three to four days a week,
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.600]   yeah, I'm resistance training.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.520]   Much less cardio.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.960]   I was running marathons,
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.840]   and it was a great social thing with my girlfriends,
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.680]   but you know, everything I did was cardio.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.080]   I taught step aerobics.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.180]   You know, the only weights I did were maybe in Zumba,
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.000]   maybe one or two pounds, you know?
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.360]   So, and that was better than being on the couch.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.920]   I mean, I loved the community and doing that,
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.840]   but you know, for me to like stay out of the nursing home,
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.400]   which was my ultimate goal for as long as possible,
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.200]   I need to pick up some weights and heavy weights,
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.360]   and so that's where my focus has changed.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.160]   - Isn't it interesting that it wasn't until recently
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.880]   that it was only bodybuilders and football players
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.200]   and people preparing for military
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.920]   or a specific sport would resistance train,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.400]   and now we are told that everybody,
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.600]   male, female, young, old, should resistance train.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.480]   - Absolutely. - Probably three times a week.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.860]   - Yeah, and my generation is struggling
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.620]   because we don't know how to do it,
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.740]   and so I'm, you know, and I'm not a personal trainer.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.780]   I don't pretend, you know,
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.000]   I hire one to help me develop a program
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.560]   so that I don't hurt myself,
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.280]   and then I can get stronger, you know, progressive loads.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.400]   So, you know, and again, Dr. Lyon,
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.200]   such a huge proponent of that,
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.360]   and so what I try to do publicly is show my workouts
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.400]   so that people, I normalize it and people see me doing it
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.320]   and they're like, well, she can do it, then I can do it.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.600]   - That's great, super inspiring,
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.120]   and it really helps cross that threshold where people,
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.240]   as you said, they don't know how, it's scary.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.080]   - Right.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.500]   - For people who've resistance trained for a long time,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.520]   they go into a gym, they know how all that stuff works,
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.140]   but for those that don't, it's-
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.020]   - You're wandering around, like, what does this one do?
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.140]   - Yeah, it's intimidating for a whole bunch of reasons.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.680]   Well, thank you for putting that content out,
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.300]   both the prescription, if you will,
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.900]   but also the example that one can go about it.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.460]   So I'm guessing if you could go back 20 years,
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.180]   you would have started resistance training earlier
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.020]   and eating more high-quality foods.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.140]   - Yeah, stronger for skin and nutrition over calories
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:14.380]   and stop looking, trying to look a certain way.
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.640]   You know, you're undermining your future health
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.080]   by doing that.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.280]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.000]   and acknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.600]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.280]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.920]   to help you better understand your body
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.960]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.160]   Now, I've long been a believer
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.840]   in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.960]   that many of the factors that impact your immediate
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.340]   and long-term health can only be analyzed
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.200]   from a quality blood test.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.900]   Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.940]   is that you get information back about metabolic factors
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.100]   and hormones and lipids and so forth,
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.220]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.100]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.100]   to know what to do with those numbers
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.700]   because they have a personalized platform
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.340]   that allows you to see the levels of those metabolic factors,
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.740]   lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.660]   and they give you specific directives
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.660]   that you can follow related to nutrition,
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.480]   behavioral modification, supplementation, and more
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.380]   that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.060]   that are optimal for you.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.700]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.020]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.380]   - So what are some other symptoms of menopause?
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.100]   You mentioned body composition changes.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.500]   The one that we hear about the most for some reason,
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:40.820]   I don't know, is hot flashes.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.260]   - Yeah, so I think hot flashes,
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.240]   so in medicine, we call it a vasomotor symptom.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.620]   So we have a dysregulation of the thermoregulatory center
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.900]   in the hypothalamus,
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.980]   and the thermostat gets reset, basically.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:59.300]   And so what happens is we have this vasodilation of,
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.380]   it starts in the core, typically, for most women,
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.460]   somewhere in the chest, neck area,
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.840]   and you feel this heat.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.860]   I can probably trigger one just by talking about it.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.780]   And it goes up into the neck,
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.980]   and out into the extremities,
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.900]   and then you just start profusely sweating
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.700]   from all the blood vessels dilating.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.780]   And then it can last minutes to a second,
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:22.140]   but for some women, it's preceded by sometimes palpitations,
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.540]   sometimes by this intense feeling of dysphoria,
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.180]   this intense sadness feeling,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.220]   and then it just kind of passes.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.820]   But say you're, wherever you are in your life,
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.040]   whatever you're doing, all of a sudden,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.860]   you're just sweating profusely
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.940]   in the middle of some important area of your life,
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.540]   work, whatever your jobs are in your life,
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.260]   and it's disruptive.
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.460]   If it happens at night, you don't sleep.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.300]   And for some women, it's severe,
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.820]   where they're having multiple ones a day.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.460]   - And when, anytime you disrupt sleep,
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.980]   then daytime is far worse.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.820]   - Yeah.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.260]   - Regulation of everything. - You eat differently.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:57.180]   Yeah, you stress differently, you know, everything changes.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.100]   And so when my patients come in,
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.740]   the first questions we ask are sleep.
[01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.660]   And that's the first thing we work on is, you know,
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.900]   what can we do to get your sleep better?
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.420]   - What can be done for hot flashes,
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.500]   aside from the things that you've already described
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.060]   to offset menopause and brain menopause itself.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.580]   - So the absolute gold standard is hormone therapy.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.700]   It's like giving your body back the estrogen,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.340]   which will get your serotonin levels back
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.460]   to where they were,
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.700]   and leave that thermoregulatory center alone,
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.860]   so it's back to where it used to be.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.140]   - Let's talk about hormone therapy.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:26.980]   - Sure.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.260]   - It's a bit of a controversial topic.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:29.100]   - For no reason.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100]   - Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know why.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.900]   - Yeah, it's demonized, it got such a bad rap,
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.180]   and we need to, it's just some of the,
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.220]   what was the worst misinformation campaign
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.460]   in the history of medicine?
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.900]   - Wow, that's a bold statement, but I believe you.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:47.940]   The way I understand it is that there was this
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.900]   large-scale hormone therapy trial,
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.460]   and the interpretation of that trial
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.460]   was something different than we now believe.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.300]   - Right.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.140]   - As a medical community.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.100]   - The initial, so it was really groundbreaking at the time.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.700]   Aging women were finally being studied.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.860]   We knew from observational data
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.380]   that women on hormone therapy,
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.100]   probably 40% of the population of females eligible
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.980]   were on HRT, okay, so very large amount.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.700]   So the women who were given hormone therapy
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.260]   had lower incidence of cardiovascular disease,
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.020]   older ages of cardiovascular disease,
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.460]   lower death from cardiovascular disease.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.500]   Some people argued that that was an artifact
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.300]   of healthier, wealthier women get HRT,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.060]   'cause they go to the doctor, okay?
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:31.500]   So this is just because they're healthier,
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   that they have less cardiovascular disease.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.980]   So let's prove it.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:35.860]   What do you do that with?
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.500]   A randomized control trial.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.060]   So flaws in the study.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.300]   So they take, I think there were 11,000-ish women
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   in the estrogen-only arm 'cause they'd had hysterectomy.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.020]   So for your listeners, if you have a uterus
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.180]   and you're getting estrogen,
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.780]   you must have a progestogen with it
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.020]   to protect the lining of the uterus from endometrial cancer.
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.900]   As long as you give an adequate progestin, you're fine, okay?
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.340]   But if you don't have a uterus,
[01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.700]   progesterone is not mandatory.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:02.980]   So the women who had had hysterectomy
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:05.580]   got estrogen-only or placebo,
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.020]   and the estrogen at the time was Primarin,
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.460]   which was the number one prescription for HRT at the time.
[01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.140]   So nothing weird about that.
[01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.380]   - So it's just synthetic estradiol?
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:15.380]   - Actually, no.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.700]   Primarin stands for pregnant mare urine.
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:20.940]   It is actually very natural.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.540]   They take pregnant horses
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:25.140]   and extract the estrogens from their urine.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.060]   Because they're pregnant and they were screeding a lot of it.
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.140]   And it was cheap and easy,
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:30.680]   and I have a lot of ethical issues about how they do that,
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.140]   but, and I don't prescribe it,
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.140]   but that's what was done at the time.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.860]   So. - I've seen horses urinate,
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.820]   they urinate a lot.
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.300]   - There are dozens, like race horse, right?
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.380]   There's dozens of estrogens in that comp,
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.780]   but the main one is estradiol.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.220]   So then there, the other group who had uteruses
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:52.980]   were given PrimPro, which is Primarin plus Provera,
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.480]   and, or placebo.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.420]   So off we go.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.260]   They recruit 11,000,
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.380]   and then I think 15,000 in the other arm.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.260]   Huge study, it was like a billion dollar study.
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:02.980]   Like, we're so excited this is happening.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.660]   And this started when I was in med school.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.300]   And then they start recruiting patients,
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.180]   and then, you know, everyone's taking their meds.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.940]   They excluded women with hot flashes.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.900]   - What?
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:16.940]   - Because if your pot flashes go away,
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.180]   you know that you didn't get the placebo.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:21.980]   So they excluded women with hot flashes,
[01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.980]   problem number one.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.060]   - Yeah, that's a big problem.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.140]   - Now, the end outcome,
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.300]   what they were trying to measure was cardiovascular disease.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:30.180]   So they started with an older population.
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.100]   The average age was 63.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.340]   - Whereas the typical onset of menopause is?
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:36.540]   - 51.
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.380]   - Wow.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.420]   - So these women had been menopausal, you know,
[01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.320]   on average for 10, 12, 13 years.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.540]   So time away from estrogen
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.460]   is when disease starts, accelerates, right?
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.620]   Okay, so put them on their meds, start measuring.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.580]   In the estrogen plus progestin arm,
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.700]   they saw a non-statistically significant
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.020]   increased risk of breast cancer.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.700]   And it was this, the relative risk, relative,
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.660]   now you know what this is,
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.700]   but your money or your listeners may not,
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.940]   was 25%, and I hope I get the numbers right.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.700]   It was four out of 1,000 women per year
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.720]   to five out of 1,000 women per year.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:17.020]   Okay, so placebo arm was four.
[01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.820]   So we have breasts, we are females, we get breast cancer.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.100]   About four out of 1,000 women per year.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:24.020]   And that increased to five.
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.900]   In the estrogen only arm,
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.860]   there was a 30% decreased risk of breast cancer.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:31.700]   - Regardless of the average age.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.020]   - And they kept that arm going.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.140]   - Right, 'cause it's randomized.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.820]   So presumably the average age
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:37.980]   for the other group is roughly 61 as well.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.060]   - Yeah, they were matched, so in their 60s as well.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.440]   So they call a press conference at the Watergate Hotel.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.280]   - The Watergate Hotel of all places.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:48.820]   - To announce the findings.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.820]   They hadn't even published the data yet.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.160]   No one had had a chance to read it.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.020]   And the head researchers call this press conference
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.060]   and say estrogen causes breast cancer.
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:00.940]   - Exogenous estrogen from these.
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.060]   - Yes, yes.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.580]   And they said it's a 25% increased risk.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.500]   But the absolute risk was like 0.8% per year.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.740]   But that didn't get, that's not a headline thing.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:12.900]   So on every, like ABC, NBC, CBS,
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   all the morning shows, nightly news, every major magazine,
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.300]   it was the number one medical news story of 2002.
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.900]   That estrogen was bad and it caused cancer and da-da-da.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.100]   The estrogen only arm kept going.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.460]   And they found after a couple more years,
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.020]   a slightly increased risk of stroke.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.500]   So they stopped the study.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.580]   The effects on cardiovascular disease were neutral,
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.840]   but there was lower colon cancer in both groups.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.660]   But no one talked about that.
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.260]   So the American Heart Association in 2020
[01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:46.500]   went and looked at, they looked at ages.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.480]   So there were younger women who were given HRT.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.780]   And what they found was if you started hormone therapy
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.200]   between the ages of 50 to 59,
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.960]   you had a 50% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.300]   and death from cardiovascular disease
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.700]   and all-cause mortality.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.900]   - Wow, so age at which you start matters.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.460]   - Estrogen, so that's where,
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.420]   there's something called the healthy cell hypothesis.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.420]   And so basically estrogen is better at prevention than cure.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   And it's very protective,
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.640]   especially in the intima of the coronary arteries.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.000]   So taking that estrogen away, we lose that protection.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.400]   Once the disease builds up,
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.580]   there's some worry that adding estrogen,
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:26.660]   once you've developed atherosclerosis or a plaque,
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.820]   might loosen the plaque, especially in that first year.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.820]   So which led for some people maybe
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.620]   to have a slightly increased risk of stroke.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.040]   So when my patients come in,
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.460]   we are talking about these differences.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.820]   It doesn't mean that after 60,
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:41.680]   you might not have cardiovascular benefit.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   We start losing the benefit.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.820]   So it's the timing hypothesis is key.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.900]   And it's the years away from estrogen that's the problem.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.980]   There's a great study in the British Medical Journal.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:56.980]   They looked at years of reproductive life plus HRT
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:01.260]   and looked at cognition scores
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.220]   and saw that the longer your body's exposed to estrogen
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:07.860]   in any form, like whether natural cycles
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.980]   or exogenous estrogen of any form,
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.140]   and it was estradiol in that study actually,
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:17.140]   then you had higher cognition scores, healthier brains.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.860]   - Which had a just very, you know,
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.520]   top contour level makes total sense
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.780]   given that estrogen is neuroprotective.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.840]   I realized it might not be neuroprotective
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.620]   in every instance and every neuron in the brain,
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.940]   but it's generally neuroprotective.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.140]   - Generally neuroprotective, yeah.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.580]   - And decline in estrogen is correlated
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.220]   with neurodegeneration, which does not mean it's causal.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.680]   I have to ask, when they announced this study
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.740]   at the Watergate Hotel of all places,
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.140]   and the conclusion that they put forth
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:48.560]   was that estrogen therapies can increase rates of cancer.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:54.560]   I have to wonder if that had something to do with,
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.880]   what I understand is a sort of party line
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.240]   around cancers and breast cancers in particular,
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.480]   which is that you wanna quote unquote
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.960]   block the estrogen receptor.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.240]   You wanna get in there and give tamoxifen,
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.920]   or nowadays I'm sure there are other drugs
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.400]   that are more effective to block the estrogen receptor.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.640]   It all seems to pile up on the side of a story
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.080]   that says, you know, estrogen and estrogen binding
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:16.600]   to the estrogen receptor is pro-cancerous,
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.400]   which obviously I think you're telling us
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.800]   in a indirect and direct way now,
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.400]   and we'll go further into, is simply not the case.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.720]   - If you take a healthy breast cell
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.920]   and dump it at a Petri dish,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.080]   and then marinate it with some estrogen,
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.480]   it's not carcinogenic.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.960]   Estrogen is not carcinogenic.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.020]   We live with it our whole lives.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.740]   If it was in pregnancy, for those of us
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.480]   who are ever pregnant, when our estrogen levels skyrocket,
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.840]   we would see this into uptick in breast cancer,
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.680]   and we don't.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.440]   - In fact, I think there's some evidence for the opposite,
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.680]   that getting pregnant prior to age 40,
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.280]   is it true that that's protective against certain forms
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.100]   of breast cancer? - That seems to be
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.560]   somewhat protective for certain forms of breast cancer,
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.400]   yeah.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.800]   So we have this whole generation of physicians
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.480]   who really weren't taught much about menopause,
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.120]   don't understand the protective benefits of estrogen
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.060]   and menopause's effect on metabolic disease,
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.200]   and they have this mentality of estrogen is bad,
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.120]   and so a woman walks into her,
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.080]   today, 2023, they looked at the data.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.680]   She goes into her doctor complaining of menopausal symptoms,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.480]   which right now are still only recognized
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.440]   as general urinary syndrome menopause,
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.200]   hot flashes, night sweats, you know,
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.080]   the very cliche symptoms.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.480]   Documents in the chart she's having, whatever,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.160]   only 10% are offered any therapy,
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.040]   and they're most likely four to one
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.640]   to be offered an antidepressant.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.880]   That is where it stands today.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:39.140]   That is what we are fighting against,
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.440]   is not every woman will choose HRT,
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.320]   but every woman deserves an informed conversation about it,
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.480]   and let her make her choice.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.400]   You know, if you believe the WHI data,
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.040]   which there are some problems there,
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.520]   the risk is small, okay?
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.600]   But did you talk to her about cardiovascular disease
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.760]   and diabetes and insulin resistance and her cholesterol?
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.440]   Because those things go up through the menopause transition
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.640]   with no changes in diet and exercise,
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.680]   and those are all, you know,
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.880]   you're more, even with the diagnosis of breast cancer,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.280]   the most likely thing a woman is gonna die from
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.160]   is cardiovascular disease, a heart attack or a stroke.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.880]   So framing it like that, I think, is where we need to head.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.720]   And the other thing is, you know,
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.920]   I was a great OB-GYN in so many areas of what I did.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.920]   Why should this all be dumped in the lap
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.380]   of the poor, busy OB-GYN who's running around the hospital,
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:31.000]   doing pap smears, trying to deliver babies,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.320]   surgery, and all the things?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.000]   Like, this should be required education
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.760]   for all, everyone in medical school.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.680]   We are females, and we're not little men
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.000]   with breast and uteruses.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.080]   We react differently to medications,
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.960]   disease, disease burden, you know,
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.640]   and that's not been studied adequately,
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.120]   and that's where the push needs to go.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.160]   It's bigger than just hot flashes.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.200]   - Do you think that one solution
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.700]   is to deepen the medical school curriculum?
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.540]   - Absolutely.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.880]   And more, and I hate saying women's health,
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.000]   because everyone thinks breast and uterus, right,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.160]   and reproduction.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.420]   It's the health of women.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.800]   And we're not addressing it differently
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.400]   than the health of a man.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.080]   And we're different, you know,
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   and so that, I think, is where we need to head.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.120]   - Given that it's half of the population,
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.000]   one would imagine that the best thing to do
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.240]   is to make the core curriculum of medical students
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.800]   expand to include this, as opposed to making it a specialty.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:28.640]   - I think so.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.320]   - Does that mean a fifth year of medical school?
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.080]   I'm not kidding, I mean, I guess.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.000]   - Maybe, I mean, people said,
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.720]   "Well, you'd have to extend the OB-GYN residency."
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.520]   I'm like, no, any specialist who touches a female
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.200]   should understand how that female,
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.040]   I mean, the starkest example is cardiovascular disease.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.520]   How much longer we have to wait in the ED,
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.440]   how much more likely we are to die
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.080]   in the hospital setting from a heart attack,
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.240]   because we don't present the same symptoms as men do,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.660]   and it's just, the default has always been
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:59.880]   how it happens to the basic, you know,
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.700]   really Caucasian male, and so, at least in the US.
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.020]   And so, because we respond differently,
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.800]   because we wait longer, because our symptoms
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.180]   are considered to be psychologically induced,
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.080]   less than biologically induced,
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.960]   and so, women are dying at higher rates.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.860]   When you look at the data on statins,
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:22.940]   you get high cholesterol, so 80% of women
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.960]   will have abnormal cholesterol levels
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.920]   through the menopause transition,
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.440]   if they were normal before, okay?
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.680]   - So elevated LDL?
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.480]   - LDL and lowering HDL.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.360]   So now they are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.260]   Automatically, a PCP will offer her a statin, okay?
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.300]   That is standard of care.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.340]   Do you know that the American Heart Association
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:43.220]   published in 2020 that statins have never been shown
[01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:45.460]   to decrease their primary heart attack in a woman?
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.140]   Secondary, yes, but no primary prevention,
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.540]   and it does not decrease the risk of death
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540]   from cardiovascular disease.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.380]   - I did not know that.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.220]   - Yeah.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.060]   Yet, we're routine.
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.380]   You know what does?
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.020]   HRT, if given in the right window of opportunity.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:04.840]   How is the HRT, in this case, estrogen HRT, given?
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.680]   Is it a patch?
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.720]   Is it injections?
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.640]   Is it a pill? - Yeah, great question.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.480]   All the above.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.240]   So we have, I like to break it down into oral
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.640]   and non-oral forms.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.800]   So everything oral we ingest goes into the gut.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:19.000]   The liver, the hepatic system will pick up the portal vein
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.760]   and take everything to the liver for processing.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.280]   When that bump of estrogen hits the liver,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.160]   we can see a slight increase
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.200]   in some of our clotting factors.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.540]   So for that reason,
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.020]   I tend to go with the non-oral formulations
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:33.860]   to avoid that risk,
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.140]   especially if she has any family history of clotting
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.660]   or personal history of clotting.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.660]   You know, we're going to go with a non-oral form.
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.660]   - So these are things like elevations and factor V Leiden.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.020]   - MTHFR, if she's had a history of a blood clot,
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:47.460]   we are not going with an oral estrogen formulation.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.020]   - And for people that haven't had a history of a blood clot,
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.900]   my understanding, which admittedly is very sparse,
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.780]   is that you can do a genetic test just by blood draw
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.640]   to see whether or not you have two normal copies
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.400]   of the gene for factor V Leiden.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.800]   Some people are heterozygotes,
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:06.880]   so they're more at risk of presumably bleeding
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.920]   in that case, right?
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.960]   But in other words,
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.540]   can people go into this knowing whether or not
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:17.240]   they're more or less at risk
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.840]   from taking estrogen-
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.600]   - So I don't think that there's a high enough,
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.640]   for that reason,
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.000]   because we're not routinely screening for these things,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.700]   unless they have a family history.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.460]   I'm going with non-oral estrogen
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.020]   as a primary product for my patients,
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.540]   'cause I can just skip that worry.
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.660]   - So a patch, typically.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.900]   - So typically transdermal.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.740]   So a patch, there's Evamist spray,
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.540]   there's FDA approved options of a patch,
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.300]   there's gels, there's a spray,
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.100]   and there is a vaginal ring, which I love, love, love,
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.020]   'cause it's so, you put it in for three months,
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.480]   and it treats, you get a two for one,
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.100]   you get a local treatment in the vagina
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.980]   as well as a systemic treatment as well.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.020]   It's just really expensive
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.980]   and typically not covered by insurance on the first tier,
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.020]   so very few of my patients can afford it.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.180]   There are some injectables,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.140]   which no one in the menopause uses.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.260]   - The menopause.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.100]   - Yeah.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:09.940]   - What a great-
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:10.760]   - There are also-
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.740]   - You've mentioned the meniverse and the menopause.
[01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:13.780]   Are those terms that you coined?
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.820]   I love it.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.980]   - I think I did, yeah.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.660]   - Great, all right, you heard it here.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:21.260]   - So the menopause is a group of healthcare professionals
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.980]   who are from multiple specialties.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.240]   We have cardiologists, orthopedic surgeon,
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.340]   internal medicine, Dr. Lyon is a member,
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.180]   and we have a big group chat,
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.620]   and we all support each other.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.420]   We support each other's books and research,
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:37.700]   and we send articles back and forth,
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.060]   and we support each other on social,
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:42.580]   but we also banded together to kind of negate
[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.140]   one of the bigger publications on menopause
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.620]   that Wendell Lancet published.
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.620]   It's a whole 'nother discussion,
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.780]   but we are fighting for equity in menopause care
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.500]   in women's health.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.700]   - Great, nothing succeeds like a group.
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:56.940]   - It's like the old menopause versus the new menopause.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.400]   - I love it, love it.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:04.260]   So hormone therapy to increase estrogen,
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.640]   how does it make women feel psychologically, physically?
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.460]   What are some of the positive changes that can occur,
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:12.820]   aside from just offsetting some of the negative?
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.700]   And I wanna make sure that I remember to ask,
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:18.180]   what if a woman has been in menopause for,
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.580]   has passed that point?
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.940]   'Cause as you said, it's a day.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.860]   So they passed that point a year earlier,
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.020]   two years earlier, three years earlier.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.260]   Given the results of this first study,
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:32.500]   which as you explained, are problematic
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.220]   in their interpretation, the way it was interpreted,
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.060]   as opposed to--
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:36.880]   - Initially, yeah.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.820]   - What's too long?
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:44.820]   Should women start estrogen therapy in their 40s,
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:47.420]   just to smooth the transition?
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.300]   - Maybe, we need more studies in this area.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.980]   Like, should we just, the minute we figure out,
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:55.420]   like I would love, like I wear a glucose monitor,
[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.620]   I have insulin resistance, so I--
[01:24:57.620 --> 01:24:58.620]   - For those listening, there's just,
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:00.980]   it looks like a little button sized sticker
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:01.820]   on the back of the arm.
[01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:06.220]   - I would love to develop one to track estrogen levels,
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:08.900]   starting your 30s, just see where you're at.
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.860]   Start seeing, are you having aberrations in your cycle?
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.620]   And we can start the perimenopause journey
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.860]   and talking about, should we begin supporting?
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.100]   I think there's a tremendous amount,
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:21.180]   opportunity for research in this area.
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.700]   But typically, we are not starting patients
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.460]   until they're very symptomatic of their perimenopausal
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:30.260]   or their postmenopausal, so in general.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.580]   - So if a woman is in her, let's say late 30s,
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:39.900]   she is anticipating perimenopause,
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.860]   or maybe is in perimenopause,
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   and wants to start low dose hormone replacement therapy,
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.900]   I think it's something worth mentioning that not all,
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.360]   presumably the dosages are tailored, and then blood.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.900]   So a given dose is tried, blood is drawn,
[01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.740]   you measure estradiol.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.940]   - So we're not, we don't have established levels
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:01.060]   of like therapeutic ranges of estradiol.
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.860]   What we found is that when we do that so far,
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.100]   I think we have some opportunity here.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:08.220]   If my level's 50 and your level's 50,
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:09.380]   I could feel like I'm on top of the world,
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:11.660]   my symptoms are gone, you still need more.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:14.340]   So we are titrating from symptoms.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:15.380]   - I see. - Yeah.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.340]   - Interesting, similar to what is done,
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.380]   similar-ish with testosterone replacement therapy,
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:24.620]   which these days, you know, I sort of half joke
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:29.300]   that you can change out the R in testosterone replacement,
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.620]   because a lot of people, a lot of men are taking testosterone
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.940]   not as a replacement, meaning their levels are not lower
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.740]   than 300 nanograms per deciliter,
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.380]   which is kind of lower range.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.540]   They're sort of low, middle,
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.260]   and they're trying to get high, you know, higher range.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.500]   But hormone replacement therapy, as I understand it,
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.300]   has never been strictly in men or women,
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:51.860]   strictly for people who are out of range,
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:55.340]   that in theory, it can be to optimize,
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.060]   reduce symptoms and to optimize well-being.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.860]   And I don't know if the medical establishment
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.340]   wants it used that way,
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:05.140]   but certainly in the case of testosterone replacement therapy
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.780]   in men, it's being used that way quite often, in fact.
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:12.940]   So we don't have established therapeutic ranges
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:13.780]   for estradiol.
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:17.300]   If she's POI, premature ovarian insufficiency,
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:20.780]   we know we want to get her to 100 or around 100 or higher
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.620]   in picograms per deciliter.
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:28.220]   But in the menopausal patient, we're rarely checking levels,
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.860]   but I do think we have an opportunity to learn a lot more
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:32.140]   now that we're able to track,
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.580]   how is it affecting your cholesterol?
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:35.660]   We need to look at those numbers.
[01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:37.500]   Like, what's the optimal dose for cholesterol?
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.380]   What's the optimal dose for cardiovascular disease?
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:43.380]   All these studies have looked at was, was she on it or not?
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.580]   So that's where I think the opportunities can come.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.820]   - So if a woman goes on hormone replacement therapy,
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:51.460]   how often is she coming in for blood draws
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.580]   or are you just, you know-
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.860]   - Well, it depends, like testosterone,
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:56.100]   we tend to check more often.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.620]   We don't have an FDA approved option
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.340]   for women for testosterone.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:00.180]   And so- - Really?
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.220]   - No.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.140]   So we either try to get her T-stem
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.620]   or she's finding someone to insert a pellet or something.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.700]   And there's other issues with that.
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.780]   What I do in Texas, it's really hard.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.900]   The pharmacists do not like to do the T-stem for patients.
[01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.300]   And I've even been- - T-stem?
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.020]   - T-stem is the gel, you know.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:23.260]   And I end up compounding it in a cream
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.900]   and do a transdermal cream for the patients,
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.580]   but there's such variable absorption.
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.620]   We do tend to check more levels of that
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:30.940]   just to try to get her therapeutic.
[01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.060]   So what for women at peak dose
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:39.420]   is somewhere in a healthy female, you know, 35 to 70.
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:41.140]   And so I had a woman coming in
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.620]   with signs of hyperandrogenism.
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.500]   You know, she's, you know, deep voice,
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.300]   hair growth, whatever, acne.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.140]   And I'm gonna check a level.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:51.060]   If it's above 90 for females, I need to look for a tumor.
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.500]   Like that's too high, okay?
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.820]   Or PCOS, it can get that high.
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.300]   Certainly above 200, that's outrageous.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:29:00.860]   So I'm trying to get my patients, you know, 60, 50, 70,
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.020]   but if she's like 50 and she's got her libido back
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.220]   and she feels great and everything's wonderful,
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.460]   then I'm hold, you know, 'cause the higher we go,
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:11.500]   the more likely you are to have side effects.
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.740]   So you're losing hair, you know, temporal hair loss,
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.980]   voice deepening, acne, new chin hair, you know,
[01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:17.940]   losing hair where you want it,
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.460]   gaining hair where you don't want it
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.020]   is how I explain it to patients.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.540]   - And so when you say 50,
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:24.780]   that's 50 nanograms per deciliter.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:27.060]   I think many people, including myself,
[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.220]   were surprised to learn
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.020]   that women actually have higher levels of testosterone
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:34.500]   than they do estrogen outside of-
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:35.340]   - In absolute ranges, yeah.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.580]   - Right, in absolute ranges.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.100]   - And I can tell you right now,
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.740]   your natural level of estradiol is higher than mine.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:43.140]   Now I supplement, but you know,
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.740]   like when I go through menopause,
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.660]   your residual estradiol is now higher
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:48.180]   than a post-menopausal woman.
[01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:51.380]   - So this is the estradiol that I have
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.380]   because testosterone was aromatized into estrogen.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.220]   - Yeah.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.740]   - Interesting, interesting.
[01:29:56.740 --> 01:30:00.660]   - So much is breaking down around the old stereotypes.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.940]   - Right, the man hormones and female hormones.
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:04.340]   Like testosterone is a human hormone.
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:05.180]   - Right.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.020]   - Estrogen is a human hormone.
[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.740]   - And they exist in both biological sexes.
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:12.460]   Yeah, it's sometimes unfortunate
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:15.940]   that compounds in the body get names like steroid hormones
[01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:17.260]   because then people hear steroids
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.180]   and then it has a gravitational pull
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.620]   toward anabolic steroid use.
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:25.500]   Or even the word fat.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.860]   You know, it's like, you know,
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.140]   dietary fat versus subcutaneous fat versus-
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:30.980]   - Visceral fat.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:31.820]   - Visceral fat.
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:32.640]   - You just have this negative connotation.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.700]   - We need better nomenclature
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:36.500]   to avoid a lot of the confusion that exists out there.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:40.060]   What are some of the other hormones that can be reduced
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.820]   and can possibly be replaced by hormone therapy?
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.780]   Like progestins, you know,
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.220]   is there a role for, you know,
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:49.700]   adjusting things like prolactin?
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.540]   Or is there a role for other hormones
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:57.100]   in what sure is to be a multifactorial thing?
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.220]   I mean, I think menopause is a process, not an event.
[01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.580]   - It's hypogonadism for females, right?
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:05.020]   And so we know that, you know,
[01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.640]   because the pituitary and hypothalamus are involved
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.460]   and that GNRH, you know, there's some cross reactivity.
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.280]   So for example, hypothyroidism.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.900]   When I have a patient who's on her
[01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:16.620]   and doing well on hormone therapy for her thyroid,
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:19.240]   so she's on T3, T4, whatever she's on,
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.680]   I'm like, listen, you know,
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.020]   we need to recheck your thyroid levels in six weeks
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:26.760]   because giving you back estrogen
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.700]   is gonna mess with a little bit of that feedback cycle.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:32.120]   So we need to make sure you're still therapeutic.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.960]   So I think we've got more work to do
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.040]   with some of the other hormones.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.760]   But when we talk about replacement and menopause,
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.120]   we are mostly looking at your estrogens,
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.120]   your androgens, and your progesterone.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.920]   So the formulations can differ.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.640]   But you know, there's a lot of misunderstanding
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.880]   around what is bioidentical versus synthetic.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.640]   And I think a lot of cottage industries
[01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.160]   in this little bubble that we had for 23 years
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.640]   where doctors were afraid to prescribe hormone therapy
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.080]   and then women were desperate for care.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:05.320]   We had some little cottage industries of people,
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.380]   I think were well-meaning and trying to help,
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.120]   but kind of developed terminology
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:11.920]   that really isn't medically specific,
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.760]   like estrogen dominance, you know, and what that really is.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.520]   And so that is not a term that is in any medical journal.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:19.040]   It's kind of something coined, I think,
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.480]   from a well-meaning provider trying to explain
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.800]   what's happening in perimenopause,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.560]   that you're having more estrogen produced
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:26.720]   than progesterone than you used to have.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:28.920]   So PCO patients do the same thing.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:32.280]   You know, there's multiple reasons for that to happen.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.460]   So when we talk about, you know, in the menoverse
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.520]   of what we're trying to replace,
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:41.240]   we all agree that we stick pretty much with estradiol,
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.320]   which is trying to give you back the water you were drinking.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.680]   So I want to get as close to what your body used to make
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:47.360]   because that's what the receptor's like.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.400]   I'm trying to give you progesterone, you know,
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.540]   rather than a synthetic.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:51.840]   Not that they're all demonized.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.120]   Progesterone doesn't work for everyone.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.660]   I'm glad I have options.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.400]   And then for your androgens,
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.280]   we pretty much just do testosterone
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.000]   and we do a transdermal again
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.960]   because the oral can be hepatotoxic
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.960]   unless it's undecanoate, which isn't available in the U.S.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.500]   So, but there's no FDA-approved option for women,
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.800]   so it's not covered by insurance.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:13.800]   We know it works for hypoactive sexual desire disorder,
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.500]   what your followers would call libido.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.200]   We think, we know it helps. - Testosterone does.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.120]   - Yeah, women at the highest quartile of testosterone
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.220]   have better bone density and stronger muscles.
[01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.620]   So I'm using it off-label for my patients who come in
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:28.240]   with osteoporosis, osteopenia, or sarcopenia.
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.360]   I'm using it off-label and telling them,
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.500]   this is probably a, it's not a Hail Mary.
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.480]   We think it works, but we don't have the, you know,
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.280]   it's not approved for that yet yet.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.920]   We know it has receptors in the brain.
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.680]   My patients are saying that they're more clarity of thought.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.520]   They're sleeping better.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.660]   They really, really like the testosterone.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.880]   So there's, you know, DHEA,
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.140]   there's a great vaginal preparation for DHEA
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:52.620]   called Intrarosa, and then the receptors there
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.800]   will start converting it into both testosterone
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.040]   and estradiol, you know, through the process.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.160]   And so the sexual medicine docs really like Intrarosa,
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:02.580]   especially for breast cancer patients
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.740]   because they get that little boost
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:05.460]   of testosterone in the vulva.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:06.440]   - Intrarosa?
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.760]   - Intrarosa's the brand name.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.400]   I think it's Prasterone, Prasterone?
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.640]   - And this is a prescription drug?
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.560]   - Yeah, these are prescriptions.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.200]   So Intrarosa's prescription DHEA, which sits for--
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.760]   - Specifically formulated for the vagina.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.840]   - Got it, which sits further upstream
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.200]   to the production of testosterone and estrogen.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.760]   - Right, and so fortunately, what's left in the vagina
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.280]   is able to, you know, plug that guy in
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.320]   and get it to produce both testosterone and estradiol,
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.360]   which testosterone is the immediate precursor.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.460]   We have to aromatize it, right,
[01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.540]   to make estradiol in females as well.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:40.640]   - These local effects on tissues are interesting.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.140]   They make perfect sense if the highest concentration
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:47.080]   is at the site of release from the patch or the gel
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.220]   or the whatever, the, you said intravaginal.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.060]   What is it?
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.040]   It's like a capsule?
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.200]   - I think the Prasterone is a insert,
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.100]   like a little gel-looking, not a gel,
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.960]   but I forget what the binding material is.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.720]   But it's like a little insert you put in, and it melts.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.860]   - Okay, so the local effects,
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.320]   because I guess, you know, it stands to reason
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.600]   that the highest concentrations can be at the site
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.320]   of the thing that's releasing the hormone,
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:11.600]   but then it also goes systemic
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.520]   by getting into the bloodstream.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.720]   - Actually, so the local formulations,
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.120]   the Prasterone and the Enterosa,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.480]   and as well as the estradiol formulated for the vagina,
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.240]   do not absorb systemically.
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:25.440]   They're so low dose.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:28.440]   There's not been clinically significant tissue absorption.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.400]   I have a formulation for my face as well.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.280]   - So it's a cream?
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.520]   - A cream that I put on my face.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.080]   It's Estriol, and so there's some decent studies
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:37.840]   with Estriol, but we lose 30% of our collagen.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.400]   It's a very big pain point for women
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400]   when they go through menopause,
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.160]   that we lose so much collagen so quickly
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.880]   in the first five years of menopause,
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.640]   and so we can slow that process down.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.960]   We can't stop it completely.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.300]   We can slow it down by using a topical estrogen,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.000]   and the topical really seems to help
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.320]   with the elastin concentrations as well.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.960]   - Interesting, so you will often prescribe
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:57.280]   a lot of local treatments for hormone.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:35:59.440]   - Yes, and really, it's so safe.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.300]   So we can take breast cancer off the table,
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.640]   all the discussion around blood clots and everything.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:06.600]   Everyone can use vaginal estrogen, and they should,
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.440]   and I'll tell you why.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.160]   - Starting at what age relative to menopause?
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.280]   - You know, the old menopause thoughts
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.040]   is do not give vaginal estrogen until she's symptomatic.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.640]   Now, all of us will become symptomatic from GSM,
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.760]   so that's genital urinary syndrome of menopause,
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.080]   so from the pubic bone all the way to the sacrum,
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   all of that tissue is heavily tied to estrogen testosterone,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.560]   and when those levels decline,
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.760]   we see thinning of the tissue, loss of elasticity,
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.320]   loss of mucus production,
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.560]   as well as the health of the urethra,
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.760]   and so UTIs, like the best treatment for recurrent UTIs
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.880]   in a menopausal patient is vaginal estrogen.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.720]   - Interesting. - Not recurrent antibiotics.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.280]   - And what about- - So it's preventative.
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.360]   - Very interesting. - And we can probably
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.800]   keep 50% of women out of the ER and out of urosepsis
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.400]   if we gave them all prophylactic vaginal estrogen.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.960]   All these little ladies in nursing homes
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.640]   should be on vaginal estrogen,
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:58.960]   so just to protect them from getting urosepsis.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.520]   - Interesting, what about urinary incontinence
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:04.840]   and some of these other symptoms
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.720]   that are associated with more elasticity,
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.600]   presumably more elasticity of tissue in that region?
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.480]   - If you're early in a, so we have stress incontinence,
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.680]   and then we have overactive bladder urge incontinence,
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.440]   and so it definitely helps with urge incontinence.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.840]   It helps to relax and decrease the inflammation
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.880]   in the wall of the bladder, so thumbs up there.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.080]   So people are getting up at night
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.920]   and having that urge to go,
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.280]   but stress incontinence is an anatomical problem.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.320]   We've lost the sling that holds up the urethra,
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.000]   and the female fails, right,
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.440]   from herniation and poor tissue health.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.040]   We can build up that health,
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.320]   and there's physical therapy, there's lots of options,
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.280]   and no urogynecologist wants to take a woman to the OR
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.240]   to do a lift if she's not estrogenized.
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.280]   They're all gonna get vaginal estrogen,
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.400]   pre, through healing, and then forever
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.760]   to keep the tissue healthy.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:58.640]   - Everything that we've been talking about
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.560]   for about the last 15 or 20 minutes
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.240]   seems to go directly opposite this large-scale study
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.760]   that was discussed at the Watergate Hotel.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:11.800]   Is your read that the medical establishment,
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:15.920]   in particular the OBGYNs in the US and in other countries,
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.920]   understand now that that study was flawed
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.300]   to some extent in its design,
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:26.320]   or is what we're talking about here really cutting edge?
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.280]   I mean, if we were to gather a roomful of 1,000 OBGYNs
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.800]   trained in various decades and put them in there-
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:33.660]   - Maybe 10% would have any idea, but here's why,
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.600]   and I'm gonna call out the American Board of OBGYN
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.960]   directly on this.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.060]   We take our board certification exams every year
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.760]   in our specialty, as every specialty does,
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:42.440]   and they give us a set of articles
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:44.800]   of the cutting-edge, newest research,
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.480]   and it's divided into categories.
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:48.680]   Obstetrics, office practice, gynecology,
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:51.960]   GYN surgery, pediatrics, oncology, you know.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.680]   There is no menopause category.
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.160]   Nothing.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.200]   So I went back over like 10 years of all my green journals
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.600]   and looked at how many articles
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.280]   were anything to do with menopause,
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.480]   and it was less than 1%.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.480]   So they were not systematically trying to put
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.760]   the latest menopause information in front of us.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.200]   They don't even recognize the Menopause Society
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.240]   as a entity.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.440]   - Well, now they have to contend with the menopause-y.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.280]   - They do.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.120]   - And because-
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.600]   - You might see me banned from the A-Box,
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.440]   but you know what?
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.260]   - No, no, no, but-
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:30.760]   - I'm so proud of what I learned.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.920]   I learned amazing things.
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:34.280]   I am a boss at delivering a baby,
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.560]   at taking care of a pregnant patient.
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.200]   I am great at pediatric gynecology.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.120]   I was so good with adolescents.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:43.400]   Where I failed, and where I let the system let me fail,
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.620]   was in the care of a woman after reproduction,
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.520]   outside of surgery, outside of her surgical needs.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.160]   - Well, I have to imagine that given the medical profession
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:53.500]   is interested in the well-being of people
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:56.780]   and in, for sake of the discussion today, women,
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:01.200]   that they will be grateful that now you have a microphone.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.360]   Many microphones in various contexts.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.400]   So that is surprising to me, however.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.640]   I would think that given the exciting findings
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.560]   around hormone replacement therapy,
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.040]   and the kind of obvious,
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.840]   at least when you described them to me,
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.040]   obvious flaws in these earlier studies
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.360]   of starting hormone replacement therapy
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.560]   when women are already 61,
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.320]   when they've already accumulated, in many cases,
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.400]   some health issues, that it would be kind of obvious.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.400]   - You miss the ability to measure the protective benefits.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.800]   But fortunately, we've got great studies
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.920]   coming out of the Danish data, the Scandinavian data,
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:44.960]   that are really looking at this again,
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.640]   and showing the protective benefits.
[01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:51.640]   - Is it generally the case that the studies out of Europe
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.880]   and Scandinavia are more forward-thinking?
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.120]   - It depends.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.640]   Some of the most forward-thinking, shockingly,
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.200]   is come out of Asia, a lot out of China.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.040]   And I asked my husband, he's worked there before,
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.480]   and he said, "There's as many researchers in China
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.680]   "that are female as male.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:10.640]   "It's not like they have a big stay-at-home culture.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:15.060]   "Women are expected to work, and they're getting PhDs,
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.660]   "and they're doing the research."
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:20.440]   And he thinks, in of one, his humble opinion,
[01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.560]   and he's an engineer, that's why.
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:24.200]   I was like, "Why do you think you've worked over there?"
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.660]   He goes, "I think because there's just as many women
[01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:28.640]   "who are writing the papers as men."
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:29.720]   - Interesting take.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.560]   I like it.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.680]   It makes good sense.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.600]   What are the various things that people can do
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:40.000]   in terms of non-hormone replacement therapies
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.480]   that can support them through,
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:45.900]   really into and through perimenopause and menopause?
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.400]   We talked about nutrition earlier.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.080]   Maybe we could touch on that a little bit more.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.000]   We talked about behaviors, resistance training,
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.400]   maintaining, maybe even increasing muscle mass.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:57.180]   There's no pressure to include them,
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.820]   but what about the various supplements that we hear about
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:01.900]   that can touch on, or we are told,
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.260]   can touch on these hormone pathways?
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:06.300]   Things like DIM, things like grapeseed extract,
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:09.900]   things like evening primrose.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.340]   - I don't think they're harmful,
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:14.300]   but there's just not robust data to really support.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.140]   So menopause society went and looked at all of them,
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.460]   even soy and everything,
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.100]   and they just, outside of cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:24.300]   which can be helpful, but it's not a menopause cure,
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:28.580]   they didn't find much in the supplement world
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.940]   that would stop.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.860]   Remember, we're defining menopause as hot flashes
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.860]   and general urinary syndrome of menopause.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:38.500]   So when I'm recommending supplements to patients,
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.860]   I do think there's some okay data on turmeric
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.140]   for maybe hot flashes,
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.700]   but I'm not saying to take that
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:45.260]   instead of replacing the estrogen
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.020]   your body is missing greatly.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:52.360]   I like the anti-inflammatory benefits of that supplement.
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.040]   I'm recommending fiber.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.280]   80% of my patients are deficient in vitamin D
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.040]   and struggling to get it absorbed.
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:03.240]   I'm recommending creatine for muscle.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.720]   I'm recommending, there's a specific bioactive collagen
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.040]   that was studied in menopausal women with osteoporosis
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:11.240]   where they saw improvement in bone density.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:13.540]   So I'm recommending a weighted vest.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.520]   Great studies, elderly women,
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.160]   but saw improvements in bone density.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.560]   And I'm like, why do we wait until we're osteoporotic
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.600]   to make the diagnosis?
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:21.440]   - Yeah, this is interesting.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.520]   So they looked at a weighted vest.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.360]   - A weighted vest.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.720]   They looked at creatine, weighted vest,
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:27.680]   vibratory training in nursing home dwellings.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.160]   So they were kind of a population
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.120]   where they couldn't go anywhere.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.840]   - Vibratory training is the shake plate.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.680]   - The shake plate.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:34.880]   And so, anything that stimulates
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.740]   that musculoskeletal unit will send the signal
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.360]   to get stronger.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.840]   What most women don't realize,
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.760]   I mean, they know about osteoporosis, right?
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.000]   And they don't wanna have it,
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.240]   but they don't understand that like your habits
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:49.580]   in your 30s and 40s are gonna put you on that path.
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:52.580]   And that your body's gonna fight to lose muscle and bone
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:54.160]   naturally through the aging process
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.060]   and accelerated with menopause.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.320]   It doesn't have to be that way,
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.100]   but you have to do the work, you know?
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.480]   And there's some hacks.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.020]   And so I love the weighted vest for a hack.
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:04.860]   I'm like, do the dishes with it on, go walk the dog.
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:05.700]   You know, like--
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:06.540]   - How heavy?
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.900]   - So you want, in the nursing home,
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:10.020]   they started at 10% of their body weight.
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.180]   So I'm like, 10 pounds, 12 pounds, start with that.
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:14.820]   So now my husband's obsessed and we have six of them
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.620]   and they go from eight to 35 pounds, you know?
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.100]   So I have different weights that I wear.
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:21.340]   Like if I'm doing leg day, I'll put the heavier one on
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:23.060]   so I don't have to hold as heavy.
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:26.340]   - So you'll use a weight vest when you're doing leg day.
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.180]   Wow.
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.900]   - So I can't, 'cause I don't have great grip strength
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.820]   and you know, and so it'll help me
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.780]   be able to squat heavier, you know?
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:33.660]   But now I'm getting better.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.980]   I've got the bar going, so I'm getting there.
[01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:37.660]   - I'm gonna tell my sister and my mom this.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:38.500]   - Yeah, and you know--
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.860]   - I've got my sister, yeah, doing some resistance training.
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:42.680]   It's been--
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:43.520]   - And it's just a cheat.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.400]   I'm so, it's so cute on social 'cause they'll post
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.060]   and tag me and they're walking their dog
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:49.380]   or they're doing whatever with their weighted vest on.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:51.080]   And now in Galveston where I live,
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.500]   you can't go, you see it all over the sea
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.340]   while everyone's walking with their weighted vests on.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.180]   - I love it.
[01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.020]   And it's hot down there a lot of the year.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:57.840]   - Yeah, it's warm, yeah.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.860]   - So no excuses people outside of Texas
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.180]   or in Texas for that matter.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.680]   But my experience is that people in Texas
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.500]   don't tend to make excuses.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.920]   Anyway, that's said like a real Californian here.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.340]   We were talking about this a little bit earlier
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:13.020]   and female specific weight vests.
[01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.060]   - I would love to develop one
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.780]   because the ones were made for men and they're okay.
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.460]   But if you have larger breasts,
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:21.040]   it's hard where the snaps are to get it on right.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.460]   And I know there's a big trend with rucking,
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.440]   but that puts all the weight on your back.
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.780]   And I really like the weighted vest 'cause I feel,
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:29.660]   and this is my opinion really,
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:31.620]   but that the reason why it's helping
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.740]   with their bone density is it's putting the weight
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.180]   on the entire axial skeleton
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:37.700]   rather than just the muscles on your back.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:40.740]   So we're putting the force more evenly supported.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.660]   - Yeah.
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:44.340]   - And so, but some of my followers
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:45.700]   have written in and said they're struggling
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.860]   because they have larger breasts
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:47.700]   and how to get this around.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:50.500]   I'm like, I got to make one that's going to accommodate,
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.260]   you know, have longer, you know,
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.460]   distract down here underneath the breast.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.540]   - Yes, someone should develop that.
[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.020]   You should develop that.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.160]   Not that you don't already have enough
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.260]   on your plate already.
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.140]   Along the topic, I like rucking.
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:04.180]   It is sort of backloaded, you know, by definition.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:07.020]   Some of the weight vests that are out there
[01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:08.540]   are evenly distributed in a way
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:09.740]   that makes them pretty comfortable.
[01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:10.920]   They're not all loaded up upfront
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.900]   like a special operator or something would wear.
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.180]   - So positive effects of the weight vest
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.760]   would be increased bone density.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.600]   You're doing more work.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.020]   - You are burning a little more calories, right?
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.860]   - You're doing more work.
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:24.700]   - You're getting stronger.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:28.300]   But I coach to it, you know, with my followers
[01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:31.940]   for this is part of my osteoporosis prevention pack.
[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:32.780]   - Love it.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:33.980]   Are you willing to share a few other things
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:34.820]   that are in the prevention pack?
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:36.780]   - So, you know, eating adequate protein,
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:37.940]   doing resistance training,
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.780]   wearing your weighted vest, creatine,
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:42.060]   five grams a day where most of the studies were done
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:42.900]   in the women.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:43.940]   - Creatine, monohydrate.
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:44.860]   - Monohydrate, yeah.
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:49.100]   And then that collagen, consider that collagen.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.660]   Full disclosure, I do sell that one.
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:53.860]   But really good investment, I think.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:56.260]   - Maybe we can talk about collagen for a moment.
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:59.500]   It's a complete protein?
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:03.620]   - No, no, it's missing one, I think one or two amino acids.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:05.880]   So it's not a complete protein.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.060]   It's better than none.
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:09.700]   So I do like include my collagen
[01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:11.140]   in my protein intake for the day
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.940]   'cause I eat all animal-based protein, pretty much.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:18.620]   So I figure I'm covered my bases to have 10% of it coming,
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:19.980]   which is missing two amino acids,
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.540]   or I think it's one valine.
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.020]   I have to look it up, so.
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.940]   - And what are the specific effects of a quality collagen?
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.100]   - So, you know, there's a lot of controversy there.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:29.260]   I've seen the videos.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:32.180]   It is broken down into its component amino acids
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:34.420]   through the digestion process.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.540]   But the first ones I looked at were totally for vanity.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:41.580]   I was changing bathing, I was trying on bathing suits
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:43.740]   with my daughter, who was a little girl at the time.
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.660]   And I was complaining about the appearance of my cellulite,
[01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.140]   even thin people have cellulite.
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:50.460]   And she's like, "Oh, mommy, it doesn't look that bad."
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.820]   And I, you know, scientist in me was like,
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:57.780]   goes on PubMed and starts looking up articles on cellulite
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.800]   and how to decrease the appearance of it.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.740]   And so I found these articles on something called Verisol,
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.520]   and it was a collagen made in Germany.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.740]   And they'd studied, actually done
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:07.180]   like really high quality studies,
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.100]   like laser measuring wrinkles and cellulite.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:10.940]   - Germans are precise.
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:14.100]   - And they, and it looked, they had positive outcomes.
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.100]   I'm like, well, it won't hurt me.
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:16.300]   So I ordered some, I Googled,
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.740]   "Where do I find this Verisol collagen?"
[01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:19.260]   I find this company, I order it.
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.540]   And then one day I talked about it on the internet.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:23.660]   And the company called me and said,
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.860]   "Would you please let us know when you do that?"
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:29.280]   'Cause they sold out of their supply for like three months.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   So the same like manufacturer of that particular Verisol
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:38.740]   made this FortiBone, did the studies,
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.820]   five years doing bone density scans on these women.
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.060]   It was a small study, but they saw improvements.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:46.460]   We know what happens to bone density if you do nothing.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:47.460]   It goes down.
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.580]   These went up.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:50.380]   And I thought, okay, I wanna do,
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:51.620]   and I wanna offer this to people.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.760]   Like, if not them, me, this is a high quality product.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.260]   I can, you know, and that's, so that's part of my,
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.980]   what I offer to people or what I recommend.
[01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:01.900]   You can get it anywhere.
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.220]   Other people sell it, not just me.
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:07.540]   - Great, so I'm perplexed.
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.460]   This isn't a challenge, but I'm perplexed.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.380]   How would a protein that's not a complete protein
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.460]   be beneficial for a body organ like skin,
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:17.700]   whereas the complete proteins
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.420]   don't seem to do it on their own?
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.500]   Nobody knows, okay.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:22.340]   - I don't know.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:23.160]   - Interesting.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.000]   - Are they not studying the right thing?
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.340]   Are they not really looking at it?
[01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:27.260]   So I don't know.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.140]   - It's great when I hear, I don't know,
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:32.780]   and the scientist in me says great area for exploration.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:35.580]   'Cause we don't really believe, in fact,
[01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:40.580]   we don't believe that amino acids
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.100]   that are derived from- - Target tissue, right?
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.840]   - Are derived from a particular body part
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.720]   target that tissue.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.540]   We've heard this argument before.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:50.460]   Dr. Lane Norton and I have both gone on record publicly
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:52.300]   saying there is basically zero,
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:53.620]   not basically, delete the basically.
[01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.580]   There is zero evidence that when you ingest heart,
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:00.300]   let's say you like eating liver or heart or skeletal muscle,
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:02.940]   that somehow the amino acids are selectively trafficked
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:05.300]   to the organ of the heart or the liver
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:06.340]   or the skeletal muscle.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.160]   There's no evidence of that whatsoever.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.380]   Certainly not in humans.
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:11.320]   If there is evidence, I'm sure they'll let us know
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.260]   in the comment section on YouTube and let us know.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:17.580]   But yeah, it's perplexing why collagen
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:20.740]   would have a selectively beneficial effect on skin.
[01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:22.660]   - They didn't study it versus a steak.
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:25.760]   You know, they just looked at bone density
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.020]   if they took this product every day for five years
[01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:28.900]   and what happened.
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.640]   And they weren't, you know,
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.580]   they weren't having tremendous cardiometabolic disease.
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.440]   They weren't on bone building medications.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.900]   They weren't on HRT.
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.040]   So, you know, they did a pretty clean.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.620]   So there's, you know, not a huge study,
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:41.580]   but it was interesting.
[01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:44.300]   And I thought, okay, you know, I don't want to break.
[01:50:44.300 --> 01:50:45.620]   'Cause if I break my hip,
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:48.960]   well, 50% of women will have an osteoporotic fracture
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.020]   before they die.
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.240]   - 50%. - 50.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.500]   - What about men do we know just by way of comparison?
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.820]   - I think it's 25.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.100]   - Wow. - But don't quote me on that.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:57.300]   I need to look that one up. - That's okay.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:59.380]   - So it's about half, okay?
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.360]   And then hip fracture, if you break that hip,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:05.480]   if over the age of 65,
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.020]   you have your one-year mortality
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:10.500]   with surgical repair is 30%.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.420]   If you're not healthy enough to have the repair,
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.860]   you can't afford to have it, it's 79.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.700]   - Goodness.
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:20.700]   - So that's what we're trying to avoid is that, you know.
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:24.320]   And the tremendous, if you've seen the women
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:27.140]   who have tremendous osteoporosis in their spine
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.500]   and just how their lives are so hard
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.420]   and how much pain they live in every single day.
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.820]   You know, a lot of this is avoidable with aggressive,
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:39.980]   you know, being aggressive and intentional about this.
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:42.500]   And HRT can be a huge part of that as well.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:44.660]   - What I'm about to ask is a little bit outside the box,
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:48.740]   but I feel fair asking it given that, you know,
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:51.100]   I'm not a clinician, but I have some background
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.300]   and certainly understanding
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:56.380]   of neurodegenerative conditions of the eye and vision.
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.660]   Have you ever observed in your patients
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.900]   that when they get on hormone replacement therapy
[01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:04.100]   for menopause, that things that are typically associated
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.700]   with aging, like diminished visual function,
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:10.260]   hearing, you mentioned tinnitus, also called tinnitus,
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.100]   I understand, but tinnitus.
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:11.940]   - Right, I can't.
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:12.780]   - We'll do both.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.620]   Tinnitus, tinnitus, tomato, tomato.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:15.000]   - And E.T. corrected me and said tinnitus.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:15.900]   And I was like, okay.
[01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:17.460]   - We'll do both.
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:22.460]   Here that they report seeing better, hearing better,
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:24.500]   and any kind of sensory improvement
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.900]   or offset of sensory loss.
[01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:29.380]   - So we know the data's clear on dry eye
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.140]   and how that can affect,
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:35.180]   but how it affects like the optic nerve, you know,
[01:52:35.180 --> 01:52:37.300]   we know that estrogen is anti-inflammatory.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:40.220]   So any kind of like inflammatory condition
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:43.180]   in and around the eye does tend to get better,
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.540]   but we need, you know, probably more data in this area.
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.900]   For hearing, most of the research
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:51.300]   is around tinnitus and vertigo.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:54.700]   So the rate of which the crystals break off in the ear
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.060]   accelerates in menopause and people on HRT
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:59.140]   have less vertigo, new vertigo,
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:01.220]   than they would have had before.
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.340]   And I forget what the pathophysiology,
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:06.100]   I wrote it in the book, but I can't think of it right now.
[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:08.020]   What the physiology was behind
[01:53:08.020 --> 01:53:11.700]   why tinnitus increases in menopause,
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:13.660]   but it's due to the estrogen levels declining.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.940]   - You mentioned dry eye.
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:15.780]   - Yeah.
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:16.600]   - A lot of people might hear dry eye
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.440]   and think, oh, no big deal,
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:21.980]   but actually dry eye is one of the most frustrating things
[01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:25.700]   to have, and it's a, I believe,
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:28.220]   a many billions of dollars a year industry
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:30.540]   to find treatments for dry eye.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.340]   So does estrogen replacement therapy improve dry eye?
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.180]   - It does seem to.
[01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:35.460]   They have less incidents.
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.300]   Most of the studies are just retroactive
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.140]   and they're looking at the incidents of those things
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.940]   on women on HRT for other reasons or not.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.980]   And they just see, especially like frozen shoulders,
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.620]   the best data there, I think.
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:49.260]   And what they see is a decreased risk of occurrence.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:50.460]   And then if they do have it,
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:52.740]   they have a shorter duration and easier course,
[01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:55.900]   you know, easier to treat if they're on HRT.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:56.740]   - Fantastic.
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:59.540]   So what are some of the cases
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:03.860]   where a woman can't or shouldn't do
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.100]   hormone replacement therapy?
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.060]   And here we're using hormone replacement therapy
[01:54:07.060 --> 01:54:09.560]   as kind of a proxy for estrogen therapy.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.580]   - Yeah, so any hormone sensitive cancer,
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.660]   A, one of the things a lot of women don't understand,
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.680]   if you have dysfunctional uterine bleeding
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:18.140]   that has not been evaluated,
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.580]   you should not start hormone therapy
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:21.540]   'cause we don't know if it's cancer.
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:23.340]   So if you're having really heavy,
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.020]   especially if they're heavy bleeding,
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:26.820]   clots out of nowhere, you know,
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:28.820]   something unusual about the volume
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.900]   or the frequency of your bleeding,
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:32.300]   you need to go see a gynecologist
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:35.300]   and get that evaluated before you start hormone therapy.
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:37.500]   Okay, it may not be anything cancerous or tumorous.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.160]   It might just be the hormone changes,
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:41.320]   but that needs to be evaluated.
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.500]   If known breast cancer,
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.500]   no, if you're actively having a blood clot
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.540]   that you're being treated for,
[01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:49.560]   they're saying let's hold off until that therapy is over.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:53.820]   Even if you've had a hormone sensitive cancer,
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.020]   including breast cancer, depending on the stage,
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.540]   the type, and it's a very nuanced conversation,
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:01.360]   does not mean that you were automatically disqualified
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.020]   for hormone therapy after your treatment.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:07.020]   So that is one of the biggest misconceptions out there.
[01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.960]   If you have really severe liver disease,
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:10.780]   I'm not talking about mild fatty liver disease,
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.820]   lots of menopausal women have that.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.140]   And it does tend to get better with HRT.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:16.980]   If you have severe liver disease,
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:19.720]   that is where estrogen begins to be metabolized.
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.360]   And so you could have abnormal metabolism.
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:23.200]   You don't want that.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:26.280]   So that's gonna keep you from being a candidate.
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.480]   - Why do you think we're seeing,
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.340]   or at least hearing about, in my case, PCOS,
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:35.740]   polycystic ovarian syndrome, so much more?
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:37.360]   Is it because people are aware?
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.400]   Is it because-
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:39.300]   - I think two reasons.
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.560]   One, the obesity epidemic had led to more PCOS.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:45.840]   That is definitely a risk factor for, you know,
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:50.040]   insulin resistance is usually the main pathophysiologic cause
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:51.600]   behind PCOS.
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.320]   And I'm a PCOS, thin PCOS sufferer.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:57.940]   So I had it my whole reproductive life.
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:55:59.360]   - But you're not obese at all.
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.400]   - No, no, they missed it forever.
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.360]   I was just stressed out medical student.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:05.200]   - Which can potentially cause PCOS.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.040]   - With acne.
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.880]   Yeah, I mean, you can have,
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:12.040]   PCOS is a symptom of something biologically aberrant.
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.680]   Turns out I'm insulin resistant,
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:15.720]   which is why I, you know, even though I'm thin.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:19.320]   And so we've had higher, increasing levels of obesity,
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.760]   which is a risk factor for that.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.640]   Also, people are talking about it
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.740]   and writing books about it.
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:25.480]   Karen Tang just published,
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.520]   it's not hysteria, wait, hysteria.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:30.500]   It's not hysteria.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:32.460]   And she's a gynecologic surgeon,
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.120]   does a lot of work around endometriosis.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.440]   So she has like huge chapters on PCOS
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.120]   and how to advocate for yourself
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:39.760]   and, you know, all about the disease process
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:41.520]   so people understand.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.600]   - Interesting, what are some of the primary treatments
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:44.440]   for PCOS?
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.920]   Is it gonna be blocking androgens?
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.320]   - So, yes.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.320]   And so for me, you know, in all my training,
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.160]   it was always put them on birth control
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:56.220]   because it will suppress ovulation
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.360]   and suppress the overproduction of androgens
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.320]   in their system.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.680]   So I was a very happy birth control patient
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.920]   'cause I was thin.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.240]   For the obese patients, if we can help them lose weight,
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:09.160]   it does tend to, they start ovulating again.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.960]   And so now with the new GLP-1s,
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.560]   a lot of PCOS will probably resolve itself
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.800]   and they'll start ovulating again
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.200]   and go back to normal cycles.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.040]   That's the pregnancies that are happening from GLP-1s.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.880]   - I see, so GLP-1 associated pregnancy.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.600]   - GLP-1 babies, yeah.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.400]   We saw a surge of that when all the patients,
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.480]   the obese patients were getting the gastric bypasses,
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.760]   then they get pregnant.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:36.320]   And so we were advising them to not be pregnant
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.760]   until their weight was stable for a year after surgery
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.320]   because of the medical implications
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.000]   of nutrition and pregnancy.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.160]   But they were so excited and cute
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.240]   and now their libido's up and they're getting pregnant
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.800]   and never really needed contraception before
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.720]   and just assumed they'd still have trouble.
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:56.080]   And so now they're ovulating and getting pregnant
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.520]   and we're seeing the same thing with GLP-1.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.360]   So anyone listening out there who's prescribing a GLP-1,
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:03.100]   please talk to your female patients about contraception
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.680]   if they don't wanna be pregnant.
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:09.360]   - Very interesting and admittedly unforeseen implications
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:10.240]   of GLP-1.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.320]   As long as we're there, what are your thoughts
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.440]   on Zempik, Monjaro?
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:17.480]   - I think that they can be a really important tool
[01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:18.740]   for a lot of patients.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.160]   I don't think they're for everyone.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:22.640]   I don't think people are being counseled adequately,
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:23.460]   a lot of them.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:26.800]   I mean, in my area outside of Galveston where I live,
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.080]   there are med spas giving out GLP-1s.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.480]   And as far as I can tell, they're just giving them the meds
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:32.320]   and sending them out the door.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.780]   I've had patients coming in on it
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:35.960]   who were never counseled about the potential
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.800]   for muscle loss.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.820]   So when I look at a patient's health,
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.920]   I look at a 30-year plan, right?
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:44.680]   And so they come in with a lifelong history usually
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:47.240]   of having a weight problem and a fat problem
[01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:48.660]   and here's this medication
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:49.960]   that's gonna take the food noise away
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.160]   and help them focus on the habits
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.400]   that are gonna keep them healthy longer.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.440]   So I do have patients that I've prescribed it to.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:57.040]   We have a very long discussion
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.360]   about adequate protein intake, resistance training.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.820]   I have a way to measure their muscle mass.
[01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:05.920]   We are tracking that every month for them,
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:09.580]   every month to six weeks while they're on the medication.
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:12.660]   So women who are on HRT with the GLP-1
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:14.740]   have a 30% increased weight loss.
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.620]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:18.420]   - Yeah, I appreciate that you mentioned
[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:22.180]   that the use of Ozempic Monjaro
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:24.980]   is not mutually exclusive with resistance training
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.820]   and improved nutrition.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:26.980]   - No, I think it's-- - The way it shows up
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.620]   on social media, it's sort of like people assume,
[01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:31.060]   well, you know, you gotta take great care of yourself
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:32.320]   and exercise, well, great.
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.760]   But there are also a number of people
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:35.360]   that are carrying excess weight to the point
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:39.680]   where they are at risk of injury when they exercise.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:41.840]   I mean, everyone's at risk of injury when they exercise.
[01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.520]   But what I'm hearing is that you basically take the view,
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:47.800]   whatever can get people in a kind of forward center of mass
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.160]   around management of blood insulin levels, et cetera,
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:52.360]   'cause it wasn't that the original FDA approval was for--
[01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.360]   - Yeah, diabetes. - Type 2 diabetes.
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:55.480]   - Type 2 diabetes.
[01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:57.840]   - And there's also some data, as I recall,
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:01.840]   that Ozempic Monjaro can reduce alcohol cravings.
[02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:05.400]   - So yeah, the reward center in the brain are the noise.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:08.080]   So they're looking now, I guess,
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.280]   my friends who are like obesity medicine specialists
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.680]   and are all like reading every study that comes out,
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.000]   any kind of impulsive behavior or reward-seeking behavior,
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.440]   gaming, gambling, alcohol, you know,
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:23.120]   people are tending to do less of those behaviors
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:26.400]   because whatever's being blocked in the brain,
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.000]   and you know more about this than I do,
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.560]   seems to help with that, those drives.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.360]   - That's interesting that the hypothalamus
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.480]   is a chock-a-block full of neurons
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:36.680]   associated with all sorts of drives
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:37.720]   and temperature regulation.
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:38.880]   You mentioned earlier, you know,
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.500]   the preoptic area of the hypothalamus
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:42.760]   involved in temperature regulation.
[02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:46.120]   And we've always viewed those as somewhat separate,
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.840]   but they're actually quite interconnected.
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:51.360]   And so I'm not entirely surprised
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.200]   that a drug that would reduce cravings for food
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:55.920]   might also reduce cravings for other things.
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:58.280]   It's gonna be really interesting to see
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.720]   what the science and the animal models
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:01.040]   and humans shows us over time.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.800]   - Over time, yeah. - It's definitely happening.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:05.600]   I mean, this is, has it hit a trillion dollar industry yet?
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.440]   It's probably hundreds of billions of dollars.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:10.920]   - I know that the majority of big research and funding
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:13.020]   is being funneled into this.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.960]   Maybe not all for the right reasons,
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.920]   but the obesity medicine specialists
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.000]   who are kind of who I turn to for how do I do this?
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.760]   How do we do it right?
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.080]   How do I not hurt someone just to get them to lose weight?
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:30.080]   And are very excited because these new levels,
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:32.880]   they say it's like the iPhone 12, the iPhone 13,
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.080]   they're just gonna get better and better
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:38.400]   with lower side effects, better profiles as time goes on.
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:40.320]   That we're gonna look back at the Monjoro
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.760]   and these earlier meds and be like,
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:44.680]   "Oh my God, what were we doing?"
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:46.160]   Because of the side effects.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:47.120]   - Well, if nothing else,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.120]   they're very interesting to pay attention to
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.120]   because it's clearly in the cultural zeitgeist right now.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.200]   So every once in a while when a guest
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:01.320]   for whom the topic is of immense interest
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.160]   coming on the podcast,
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:04.800]   I'll put out a call on social media for questions.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.200]   And so if you're willing,
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:10.960]   I'd like to just ask you a few of the audience questions
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:14.000]   and we can treat these as rapid fire
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.260]   or as much depth as you like.
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:19.720]   First off that many of the questions
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:20.920]   you've already answered,
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.360]   things like what is the role
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.840]   for testosterone replacement therapy in women
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.400]   as opposed to just estrogen replacement therapy.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.440]   But one of the more common questions in here
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:32.020]   that we've touched on,
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:37.020]   but I think could deserve a bit more attention is,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.020]   if a woman is in her 60s
[02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.160]   and has already gone through menopause,
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.800]   is it appropriate for her to consider
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.200]   or at least just talk to her doctor
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:45.680]   about hormone replacement therapy
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:47.400]   or is she putting herself at risk?
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.360]   - There's definitely worth the conversation.
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.520]   So if I have a patient who comes in
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.400]   and she's more than 10 years past her menopause
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.000]   or over the age of 60 and has not been on HRT,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.520]   then we start looking at risk factors
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.600]   for cardiovascular disease or stroke.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.840]   And so we're looking at her blood pressure,
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:09.680]   her lipids, her cholesterol and triglycerides
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:11.240]   and looking for things
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:13.600]   that are gonna put her at higher risk.
[02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.980]   She's lost probably the maximum cardiovascular benefit,
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:19.280]   but we don't wanna put estrogen
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.160]   on top of severe atherosclerotic disease.
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.240]   So if she has abnormal cholesterol,
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.760]   I'm gonna send her for a calcium cardiac score.
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:30.760]   I wanna see if there's calcified plaques around her heart.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.920]   I may even, if stroke is a risk,
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:34.760]   we may even send her for an ultrasound,
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:37.440]   looking at the intimal thickness of the carotid.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:41.360]   So if those are normal or low risk,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.760]   then we will talk about the benefits of,
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.400]   what would the benefits be for her after the age of 60?
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:49.080]   Well, we probably lost the best
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.560]   of the cardiovascular protection,
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:53.400]   but it will always protect her bones.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.740]   It will always protect her genital urinary system.
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:57.200]   It will always protect her skin.
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:00.480]   I mean, there's things that estrogen will do for us forever.
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.480]   And so, and then let her make the decision,
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:04.400]   certainly if she's still symptomatic,
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:07.160]   meaning hot flashes or things we can easily identify
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.200]   that we know estrogen will help with.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.200]   But that first 10-year window is kind of critical
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.600]   for the preventative benefits,
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:16.780]   but it doesn't mean she's not gonna benefit forever.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.560]   Now, when do we stop?
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:20.720]   Used to be, doctors make up numbers,
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.040]   three, 10 years, whatever.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:26.160]   If she's been on it since early in her menopause
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.720]   and has not developed any of these diseases,
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:31.280]   and she wants to keep going, we're gonna keep her on.
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.000]   I will probably die with my estradiol patch on
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.400]   if I don't develop a reason to take it off,
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:40.040]   'cause I know it's protecting me in so many levels,
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:41.440]   and I wanna keep that going.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:44.300]   - In so many ways, it sounds very similar
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:46.360]   to testosterone replacement therapy in men.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:47.760]   The idea is that people get on it and don't--
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.040]   - Yeah, well, you stop at 70.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.780]   Why would you do that, you know,
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:53.600]   if you didn't develop a contraindication to it?
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.480]   - Very clear and potentially very actionable answer.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.720]   Thank you.
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.240]   A number of the questions related to
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:06.280]   the relationship between menopause, hormone therapy,
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:08.560]   and mental health, mental wellbeing.
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:13.080]   But let's just keep it simple for now and ask,
[02:05:13.080 --> 02:05:15.000]   what are the things that women can do
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000]   in order to optimize their mental health
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.120]   in perimenopause and menopause,
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:25.300]   and that they can do to offset any mental health issues
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:27.680]   that might arise during perimenopause and menopause?
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.760]   And there's a reason why I asked
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:29.880]   about those two things separately.
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:30.720]   One is just to--
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:33.760]   - Peri's very different than menopause for mental health,
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:35.640]   so it's a great question.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:38.320]   So I just went to a menoposium,
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.440]   menopause conference in Chicago,
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:44.680]   and there was a whole section on mental health,
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.360]   and it was neuroscientists, psychiatrists,
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.840]   and menopause specialists all up there
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.160]   discussing the latest data.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.120]   It was so fascinating.
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:54.280]   And so there really is a big difference
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:56.320]   as far as mental health for what's happening
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.800]   in perimenopause and what's happening postmenopause.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.240]   And as we talked about earlier,
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.880]   in perimenopause we have that hormonal zone of chaos,
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.480]   and we see this, you know, in the Australian data,
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:08.960]   it's a four times risk of mental health disorders,
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.960]   especially depression.
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:14.360]   And then in postmenopause,
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:17.280]   a lot of these things tend to stabilize or get better,
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:19.400]   probably 'cause just the estrogen is bottomed out
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:22.280]   and the brain is not having to deal with these fluctuations.
[02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:27.280]   So we think that the data is looking like
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:30.640]   the best treatment for the mental health issues
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:35.640]   in perimenopause is going to be estrogen for stabilization
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.360]   and not the traditional SSRIs, SNRIs,
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.480]   you know, the antidepressants and the anxiety meds.
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:46.360]   - Not incidentally, one of the more common questions was,
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.480]   in this case, very specifically worded,
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:50.680]   I've been on HRT for five years and I'm 61.
[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:53.640]   I feel great, but how long is it "okay" to be on them?
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:55.080]   Seems like I hear conflicting opinions.
[02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.160]   Well, we just heard a very straightforward opinion.
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:58.120]   So thank you for that.
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.760]   - As long as you want to be, as long as you're still healthy.
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:03.800]   - How can I stop waking up in the middle of the night?
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.960]   This is a problem since entering menopause.
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:12.800]   So we see sleep disruptions definitely from,
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:15.140]   not only from the vasomotor symptoms,
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:17.300]   which will wake you up, okay?
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.460]   If we can get those under control, you know,
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:22.440]   your sleep function should not be affected by that.
[02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:26.160]   What we're seeing though, is people, even with HRT,
[02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:27.780]   even with estrogen are still having
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:30.000]   middle of the night awakenings or racing thoughts
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.100]   or having, they get up to pee or something
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:33.680]   in the middle of the night and they can't go back to bed,
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:35.760]   usually 'cause their brain is going on.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:37.560]   What we found is that progestin,
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:39.920]   probably through the effects of GABA,
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.000]   is very effective at settling your brain down
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.120]   and allowing for sleep.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:48.520]   So I'm having my patients take their progesterone
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:50.800]   orally at night before they go to bed.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.920]   And we're seeing better sleep with that.
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.280]   And that was also something covered in detail.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.520]   I was so excited by the neuroscientists
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:59.080]   as part of her area of research,
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.320]   that they are showing clearly,
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.120]   and she can point to the neuroreceptors
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:03.520]   of where that's happening.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.800]   That progesterone seems to be
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:06.960]   really protective for our sleep.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:10.000]   Now, take hormones off the table.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.400]   Sleep hygiene is still hugely important.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:15.180]   And I need to see the studies to prove it,
[02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:17.680]   but I'm telling you, we do not tolerate alcohol
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:20.360]   like we did pre-menopausal.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:22.440]   Women are in at least 90%.
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.880]   Every time I post about it online,
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:25.840]   I see thousands of comments of,
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.140]   "I quit, I had to give it up, I cannot sleep."
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:29.200]   And even in my own life,
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:32.080]   if I choose socially to have more than a glass of wine,
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.520]   I am giving up sleep.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:34.600]   Like, it is a choice.
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:36.020]   I'm choosing not to sleep that night.
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:38.700]   I will wake up 2.23, 3.35,
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:40.360]   whatever time in the morning, sweating,
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.520]   and I'm like, you know,
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:45.320]   too much champagne at New Year's or whatever.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:47.160]   So, you know, that is a choice,
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.680]   and it's something I counsel my patients about.
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:51.560]   Like, you probably can't tolerate alcohol like you used to.
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.900]   Aging's a factor here, our body composition changes,
[02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:55.760]   and there's probably something hormonally that's going on
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.200]   we don't understand yet.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.200]   But like, you choose this,
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.320]   you're gonna choose not to sleep, more than likely.
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:03.000]   - Interesting, I wonder whether or not
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.960]   estrogen modulates the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme,
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:07.560]   but time will tell.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.720]   - I haven't seen the data yet, but I'm sure it's coming.
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:11.320]   - Here's an interesting one.
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:13.840]   How can men help their female loved ones
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:15.860]   navigate these stages?
[02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:17.040]   You get that question a lot?
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.840]   - My, and it's great.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.000]   And it always comes on the,
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.560]   when I'm being interviewed by a male.
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:23.700]   You know, when I'm interviewed by a female,
[02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:26.320]   they're wonderful, but they have their own experience,
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.600]   and they have to talk about it.
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.280]   And that's fine, that's my job, you know,
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:31.220]   is women have to unpack their menopause trauma
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:33.280]   to me, but the men are just so curious,
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:34.340]   and just have so many questions,
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:36.480]   and then how can I support a partner?
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:38.480]   And, or my mom, or whomever in my life,
[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:39.840]   who's dealing with this.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:42.360]   One is acknowledge that this is happening,
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.840]   and try to educate yourself.
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.160]   There's my book, other books,
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.000]   there's lots of information now on the internet
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.480]   about the subject, but she is going through a transition
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.940]   that is rocking her world, more than likely,
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:54.800]   and is affecting her brain, her bones,
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:56.600]   her heart, her kidneys, her skin,
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:58.920]   her ability to relate, her ability to tolerate,
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:00.460]   and it's probably gonna affect her relationship
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:01.300]   in some way.
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:04.580]   Go there with her, go to the appointments with her,
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.760]   be there to advocate for her, you know,
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:08.440]   be a partner through this with her,
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:10.000]   'cause you will get her back,
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.560]   but it's gonna take, you know,
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.920]   changing the way that you address things.
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.800]   - A couple of questions about, quote,
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:17.920]   "How to rekindle libido."
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.600]   - Oh yeah, no, it's a great-- - This person in particular
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.320]   says, "It's packed its bags and moved out
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.660]   "since I started menopause."
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.580]   They're reporting their individual experience,
[02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:28.520]   but you touched on testosterone therapy earlier.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.060]   Any woman in her menopause journey,
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:36.840]   at any time, there's a 50% sexual dysfunction rate,
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:40.180]   meaning she's not happy with whatever's going on.
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.660]   Now, when we look at the buckets
[02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:42.980]   where sexual function fall into,
[02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:45.120]   we have orgasmic disorder.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.900]   Now, in menopause, when we lose blood flow to the area,
[02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:49.900]   people can have delayed orgasms,
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:54.020]   or less, the peak of the orgasm is lower,
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.900]   you know, less vibrant orgasms,
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:10:57.200]   for lack of a better word.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:00.380]   They have decreased blood flow to the area,
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:03.260]   they lose elasticity, so pain is another bucket.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.780]   You know, it hurts, the skin gets torn,
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:07.840]   it's very fragile, it's very friable,
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.660]   so vaginal estrogen therapy can help there.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:13.900]   There is arousal disorders where you want to do it,
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.860]   but the blood's not getting where it needs to go,
[02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:18.860]   so you're not having all the arousal-type symptoms,
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:21.300]   so sometimes Viagra, Sildenafil,
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:24.060]   topical Sildenafil can be helpful there.
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:25.900]   But the most common thing that women have
[02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:28.940]   is HSD, or of course, relationship disorder.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:30.840]   You don't love your partner, you don't feel supported,
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.240]   it's gonna be hard to, you know--
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.000]   - Relationship disorder. - Yeah, relationship disorder.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.200]   - The official term, yeah.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.980]   - But then HSDD is hypoactive sexual desire disorder.
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.160]   That's in the brain.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.800]   And so first thing I ask is,
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:43.400]   did you used to have a good libido or a drive?
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.600]   Yes, you know, and you have a good relationship
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:46.840]   with your partner, it doesn't hurt,
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:49.120]   you don't have to rule out the other things.
[02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:51.100]   That's where testosterone comes into play.
[02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.460]   That is those patients it does tend to help.
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:55.820]   There are two FDA-approved medications for libido,
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:58.600]   one is Vilese, it's an injection you give yourself
[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.680]   and actually works for men as well,
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:01.200]   about 30 minutes before.
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:02.840]   - It's in the alpha melanocytes stimulating hormone pathway.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.040]   - Yeah, so melanocortin.
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:07.520]   And then there is Addy, A-D-D-Y-I,
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:10.140]   works at the level, I think of dopamine, in the brain.
[02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:13.640]   So it's more in the family of SSRIs that, you know,
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:15.020]   so it affects neurotransmitter.
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.960]   And so you take that every day.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.640]   And it works, it was only studied in premenopausal women,
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.040]   but it does, you know, it's modest,
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:25.360]   but it does seem to have an effect.
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.660]   So, but most of my patients,
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:30.700]   because testosterone has so many other benefits,
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:33.760]   and then the cost, to get it compounded in Texas
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:35.120]   is maybe 30 bucks a month.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.640]   So it's really reasonable.
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.200]   And the Vilese and the Addy can be very expensive
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.600]   and usually not covered by insurance.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:43.680]   So because of cost and potential other effects,
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.720]   most of my patients choose testosterone if it's HSDD.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:47.560]   - I see.
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:50.520]   This is a question about the side effects
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:54.160]   associated with estradiol hormone replacement therapy.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:57.800]   In this particular instance, the person says,
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:00.560]   what are the best alternatives to estradiol?
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:02.640]   I've tried tiny amounts and the side effects,
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.840]   in this case, skin rashes and hives
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.120]   are what they are describing.
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:07.720]   - So I wonder if it's the patch.
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:10.320]   So there's a certain percentage of patients who,
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.520]   it's not the estradiol,
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.680]   it's actually the adhesive in the patch.
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:15.360]   They will have a reaction to it.
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.940]   So one is try an alternative form.
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:20.520]   Another thing that one of the members on my team
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.520]   saw in her chat group is they get the Flonase,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:25.680]   the corticone nasal spray over the counter
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.400]   and they spray it on and let it dry.
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:29.800]   Then they put the patch on and it decreases the risk
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:32.160]   of the reaction to the glue.
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.880]   I don't know how, if that lasts forever,
[02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:36.160]   but I thought that was a cool thing to know about.
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.640]   And, but what I typically do for my patients
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:41.160]   is change them to an alternative form.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.360]   - Interesting.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:43.200]   Thank you for that.
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.020]   They went on to ask about trying a new supplement
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:49.600]   called Equel, E-Q-U-E-L-L-E.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.280]   - I think I read about that one.
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:54.080]   Again, I don't know what's in Equel,
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:56.480]   but again, not really robust studies,
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.420]   but most of these things are not harmful,
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:01.140]   but you may just, it may be a little snake oil,
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.760]   you know, throw your money away.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.000]   Really the thing that's gonna fix the problem
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.880]   for most women is restoring your estradiol.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.560]   - Yeah, because there were other questions about,
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:14.560]   you know, wild yam and things more in the supplement space,
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:17.200]   as well as things like acupuncture and herbal medicine.
[02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:20.900]   - So acupuncture can really be helpful,
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:24.280]   but again, it's hard to access
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:26.000]   and can be expensive for a lot of patients
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.440]   and it's not treating the root cause,
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:28.880]   but it definitely can help you deal
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:31.440]   with some of the symptoms and make you more comfortable.
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:35.440]   - And then last question, how best to attack,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:36.280]   and here I'm quoting,
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.760]   "Attack the fat distribution problem at this time."
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:42.080]   - Yeah, you need a multifactorial approach to visceral fat.
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.560]   So nutrition, exercise,
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.060]   women on HRT have less visceral fat, you know,
[02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:50.600]   those are kind of the key things.
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:53.640]   And the way you approach your nutrition with the exercise,
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:54.880]   with the stress reduction,
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:56.040]   getting those cortisol level down
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.920]   are gonna make you healthier in every other way as well.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.340]   - Great, well, Dr. Mary Clare,
[02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:07.760]   thank you so much for giving us just a wealth of knowledge
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.600]   about perimenopause, menopause,
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:13.280]   really explaining what those are clearly
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:15.080]   for the first time on this podcast.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:18.760]   And really illustrating the things that people can do
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.520]   to think about these stages of life
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.080]   and to, I don't know if I should say tackle,
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:25.240]   or to dance with the stage of life,
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:27.880]   whatever term one prefers,
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.320]   in order to offset the negative effects.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:33.280]   And it sounds like, in fact, it's very clear
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.120]   based on what you've told us
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.440]   that there are real levers of control,
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.920]   including hormone replacement therapy,
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:43.280]   but other things as well, nutrition, exercise.
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:45.040]   Sounds like when we put all these together,
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.280]   there's almost like a mindset
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.920]   around perimenopause and menopause that you are promoting,
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:53.080]   which is one of real agency,
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:54.200]   that this is not something
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:57.720]   that is going to bury us mentally and physically,
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.360]   that's something that really can be worked with.
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.360]   And I just wanna say on behalf of myself,
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:02.800]   'cause I've learned so much from you here
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:06.160]   and the listeners and viewers of the podcast,

[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:20.080]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:21.600]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.000]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.920]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:26.200]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.

[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:46.600]   to how to improve your sleep, to optimizing dopamine,
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:48.680]   deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:50.920]   We have a foundational fitness protocol,

[02:18:09.380 --> 02:18:11.560]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.520]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:16.100]   (upbeat music)
