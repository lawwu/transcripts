[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   - All right, next question we got from Michael.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.400]   He's in operational technology,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.240]   and he's got a question about estimating time
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.000]   to complete a task.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.040]   - Hi Cal, Michael from sunny Ballarat, Australia here.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.560]   I work in operational technology
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   where the real things happen.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.620]   So studies suggest we're terrible at estimating time
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.860]   required to complete a task,
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.760]   and that getting started is half the battle.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.440]   I feel like there is competing thoughts
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.000]   on how to deal with this.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.620]   On one hand, a task will expand to the time allocated to it.
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.920]   So allocate a short time
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.860]   and just get what you can done as a forcing function.
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.440]   On the other hand, take your estimate of time
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.000]   needed to complete it and double it
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.240]   to make sure you don't over commit or over schedule yourself.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.980]   I'm always running out of time in a block
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.240]   or finishing early.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840]   How do you approach this tension?
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.380]   - Well, Michael, the good news is that you are time blocking.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.740]   So if you're time blocking,
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.900]   you have a hope of actually figuring out
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.900]   how long things actually take.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.860]   It's one of the great advantages of time blocking
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.380]   is that you get real time feedback.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.360]   I gave this type of work this much time
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.860]   on my time block plan for today,
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.240]   and I did not hit that time.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.080]   How do I know?
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.360]   Because I had to build a repaired schedule next to it
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.860]   because I blew past that time.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.520]   Most people don't get this feedback, right?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   They're just like, what do I want to work on next?
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.080]   They kind of work on something
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.120]   and it takes longer than they think,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.160]   and then they're scrambling at the end of the day.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.100]   But they don't get that clear feedback
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.080]   for three weeks from now
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.280]   when that same thing is on their plate that they think,
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.680]   oh, wait, I actually need to start this
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.520]   a little bit earlier.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.060]   This really takes this much time.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.320]   If you're not giving every minute a plan
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.800]   and seeing how well that plan unfolds,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100]   you're really not internalizing this feedback.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.900]   So this double the time you put aside rule,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.560]   that is useful when you are new to time blocking,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.960]   or at least when you're new to time blocking
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   a particular type of activity.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   Yes, our instinct is we schedule not enough time.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.040]   What I usually tell people
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.920]   if they're new to time blocking is 50% more,
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560]   doubling would be a little bit more conservative,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.440]   but people really underestimate at first.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.400]   However, and this is the real benefit,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.580]   you won't have to keep doing that forever
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.820]   because you will get better at these estimates.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.720]   So you put down time, when you hit it, you're happy,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.020]   when you don't, you don't.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.180]   You're getting reinforcement here.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.740]   Do this for a few weeks,
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040]   you're putting down the right amount of time.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.900]   So if you're time blocking,
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.740]   yes, there's a place for this heuristic
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.500]   of just add more time than you think,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.040]   but it's only when you get started.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.900]   If you're more or less hitting it just about right,
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.260]   then you say, okay, I know how much this takes.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.840]   And then you can stick with that time.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.980]   So that's what I would suggest is
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.460]   if you're blowing past your blocks, use a 50% rule.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.140]   If that's working, then stick with it.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.980]   You're probably right about where you need to be.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.020]   So you'll get better at this
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.880]   as you keep practicing with your blocks.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.660]   All right, we're pretty technical today, Jesse.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.140]   I think we had a call about process consulting.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.620]   We got an operation technologist talking about time blocking.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.580]   So we're sort of in the business weeds today.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.740]   Are we keeping that up with the next one?
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.580]   What's the next one?
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.160]   (upbeat music)
