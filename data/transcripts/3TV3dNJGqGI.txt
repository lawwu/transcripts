[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   We don't have a cold open.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Well, since you guys decided to go rogue, and agreed on a
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880]   vacation week and then decided free bird decided he would go
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.160]   rogue, it gave me a little extra time when I was whitewater
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.280]   rafting. Hold on a second. Friedberg did not decide to go
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.680]   rogue. He went rogue. Your two peers decided to go rogue. I was
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.560]   taking the week off. They both sent on the text stream. We want
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.080]   to do a show this week. And I said, Sure, I'll do it. I mean,
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.040]   but I'll do it. It's fun. You went rogue. Yeah, that's what I
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000]   said. There was no vacation agreed to.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.040]   I don't even know your schedule. You're too busy writing 30 tweet
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.320]   storms about hunter Biden. Why would all of a sudden there be a
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   skip week in the middle of July? It's just because you were off.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.360]   No, we said,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.480]   vacation. No, you'd agree. I also have to give my producers a
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   week off now and again, because they work into the weekend
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.840]   editing the stuff. So your editors, you can just swap them
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080]   out. I have two editors. Yes, I gave everybody the week off. The
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000]   point is that when one of us said no, no, is off on a given
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.560]   week, the show goes on. That's what you always say. But then
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.000]   when you have a need to go on vacation, no, then you know, it
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   gets canceled. No, what would have happened was what would
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.720]   have happened was I would have put one of my producers on for
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.000]   that we're gonna give the other one off. But because we all said
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.720]   we're gonna be off that week, I gave everybody off that week
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960]   because I said, Let's take advantage of this. That's what
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.320]   actually happened. But that's fine. Because you didn't go back
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.480]   to us. We had to have
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   literally both said to you in the chat, we're off this week,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.400]   we're off this week. And we confirmed with your teams.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.440]   Multiple times we were off this week. It's no big deal. If you
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.680]   want to go 52 weeks later, we want to record this on
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.760]   Wednesday. On Wednesday, when everybody had already been
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.800]   given off. I know that everybody who works for you is
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.040]   just you just went dark. I
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.400]   didn't respond to us. I we Nick and I both responded. We're off
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.160]   this week. Please don't pretend like you're a great boss. We
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.480]   don't know what about I know that you're I know that the
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.760]   search will work for you do not get days off. But I treat the
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.160]   people who work for me like part of your organization. Try to my
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   organization. What's the average tenure of one of your employees
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   is like six months. No, no, actually, it's more like four or
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.680]   five years. I mean, I have people for five to 10 years now.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.480]   It's pretty impressive. Actually, you know, what's
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.280]   interesting, my tenure is actually bimodal. It's either
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.480]   years and years and years and years or out the door one year
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.240]   or months. Yes, that's the way it should be. Either you hit the
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   notes or you don't and you should know quickly. There's
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.080]   nothing in the middle. Yeah, that's the way it should be.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.240]   Actually. I was sitting by the the river went whitewater
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.440]   rafting on the rogue river. When free bird went rogue. Why am I
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.920]   the one who went rogue? Because I don't like you. That's the
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.200]   reason I'm not blaming the other two guys. I'm friends with them.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.680]   It's obvious. So just joking with these 3pm. When did I become
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.040]   the enemy?
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.440]   Rain Man David
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.840]   sack.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:58.680]   All right, the big news this week is inflation has eased to
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.280]   3%. In June, we'll throw up a chart here. It's the slowest
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000]   pace in more than two years. So the feds increases have worked.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.160]   And I guess the question now is, are we going to have a sustained
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.480]   high interest rate? Or is it going to get cut slowly? Chamath
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.440]   and free bird, you've been talking to a number of people
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   about this, I think all in summit 2023. Speaker Larry
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.120]   Summers has been pretty vocal about this. What's your take
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.080]   free bird? Yeah, I mean,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.720]   I think Larry said publicly that he thinks that rates are going
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.480]   to need to be higher for longer than what the market is
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.960]   currently showing. We talked last week with Brad, obviously,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.120]   about what the market is showing rates to be and he's assuming
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.880]   some rate cuts will start to happen in December. And that's
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   really what the market is saying is going to happen. And Brad's
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.920]   point was the market knows better than the forecasters. But
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.040]   Larry Summers has publicly shared that he thinks that that
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.600]   is actually not correct. And you know, again, diversity of views
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.280]   is important to understand that there are structural things that
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.600]   are happening in the world right now, including a decoupling from
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   China, which is inflationary, because, you know, China provides
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.600]   cheap goods and cheap manufacturing for a lot of
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   industries. And many of those industries sell to consumers. So
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.880]   ultimately, those prices are going to show up in consumer
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.560]   costs, there's an increase in energy transition, expenditure
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.960]   and security globally. And Summers has pointed out that
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.040]   those are not free, they have to be funded. And obviously taking
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   on more funding means you're going to have to pay higher
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.000]   interest rates for investors to provide that capital to do that
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.400]   funding. So there are more structural, longer term trends
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.280]   that some folks in the Summers camp have been arguing are going
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.000]   to be driving inflation higher and keep rates higher for much
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.880]   longer than what the market is currently showing. And I think
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.440]   it's really worth noting that point of view, particularly
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.240]   given how quickly the market thinks rates are going to start
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.760]   getting cut.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.520]   Shemoth, you've been talking about the interest rates and
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   that you believe it will be persistent. So higher for
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.840]   longer, you're sticking with higher for longer on the interest
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.440]   rates, I assume?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.240]   Yeah, I think the more important thing from that J Cal is, so
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.720]   what do we do about it? And I think the most important point
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.080]   of view that I'm trying to get to is where do I think the
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.840]   equity market is going to go? And, you know, all roads, at
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.520]   least right now look like the market is getting set to go
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.880]   materially higher. And the reason isn't whether, you know,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.920]   terminal rates are at 2%, or 3%, or three and a half percent, I
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.800]   don't think that matters that much. What matters more are the
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   trillions of dollars that are sitting on the sideline or in
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.640]   other defensive assets that need to then pivot around and get put
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.080]   back into growth assets once you know that the worst is behind
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.400]   us. And I think that's what a market always looks for before
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.160]   real sentiment changes. And what's important to note is that
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.640]   by the time most people figure out that the sentiment has
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.760]   changed, it's already actually too late. And so I think right
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.000]   now in the next sort of like 12 to 18 months is really when the
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.080]   bottom is put into the market. It's before the Fed starts
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.480]   cutting. It's when rates are still going to be relatively
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   high. But the really astute sharp in this market will get
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.360]   ahead of it, and they will start to buy what they think will be
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.320]   an eventual rally. And then it's going to get supported by the
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.200]   fact that if not enough people are also long, you get caught on
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.760]   the wrong side, you don't necessarily have to be short,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.840]   you just aren't long enough. And what that does is put pressure
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.160]   on your business model. So if you're a mutual fund, or if
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.320]   you're a hedge fund, and you've missed most of this rally, which
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.840]   most people have, because it's really only been five or six
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.080]   companies. So I think that Larry is right. I think that I still
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.040]   believe what I've said for a while, which is rates will be
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.480]   higher for longer. But what I didn't believe before, was that
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.360]   the market was set to go up, I think we did a great job. I
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.400]   think literally that when I made that comment, November of 21
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.520]   about starting to sell, it was the absolute top of the market.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.880]   Yeah, you know, that one, you know, that one nailed it. Yeah.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   And I think my commentary now is that we're putting in the
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.880]   bottom. And I think the market is set to go materially higher,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.520]   even if rates are persistently higher for just to challenge
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.480]   you on that second point, the bottom really was put in maybe
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.800]   last summer, you're really speaking to the psychology and
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.520]   the dynamics of capital allocation, there are people who
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.760]   were scared, maybe and thought the bottom could get much worse.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.520]   And they didn't want to put money at play. There were some
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.600]   people who are brave enough to put money in play in the last 12
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   months. I'll give myself a pat on the back. I did J trading
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.360]   starting last summer, and I'm up whatever 25%, something crazy
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.960]   like that, because I picked all the big tech companies. But
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.160]   you're saying now, because I did that, but that's a good
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.960]   example. Just to pick on that. The reason you did well, was
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.040]   mostly because they were oversold. Meaning that was my
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.960]   perception. If you look at those big tech companies, and but
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.440]   that's not a sustainable thing. If you're trying to own great
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.240]   companies, the reality is those seven companies, one of them in
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.880]   video is actually firing on all cylinders. Everybody else just
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.520]   stopped acting like a fucking moron. And that's not a
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.160]   sustainable business strategy, meaning, you know, burning
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.400]   billions and billions of dollars a quarter totally wastefully
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.240]   with all kinds of random free stuff to a bunch of entitled
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.600]   side projects, side quests, and then taking that away, doesn't
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.880]   ensure long term success for anybody. All it does is just
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   tourniquets the bleeding. And so you have more material short
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.480]   term cash flow, and the markets are going to reward it,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.080]   especially in a moment where it's the trade off is against
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.600]   rates, short term rates that are five or 6%. But from here,
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.280]   right, the real long term value creation is still going to go
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.720]   to the companies that are building true product market fit
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.760]   in product value could well send our and are really growing in a
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.800]   material way from adoption and usage, not from cost cutting,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.720]   because people see through that. And when rates start to get cut,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.760]   they'll see through it even faster. The only time cost
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.680]   cutting gets rewarded is when short term rates are this high
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.480]   because people love short term cash flow.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.840]   Yeah. And it was when the the moment I saw Zuckerberg and
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.320]   Airbnb, Uber, other places just start and obviously Google and
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.480]   Microsoft start making cuts. You're like, okay, people are
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.880]   going to lower their costs. They're doing triage, as you're
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.800]   saying, to make the balance sheet to make the orange works
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.600]   in the final third of a bear market. Okay, so but triage does
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.840]   not work in a bull market. You don't get rewarded for triage in
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.200]   the bull market. I totally get it. You have to innovate, you
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.680]   have to build great products. So Saxman, you're looking at the
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.480]   overall market, I think we talked about the average
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.240]   recession or downturn is six quarters plus or minus one or
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.880]   two. Historically, we are entering the seventh quarter of
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.720]   the downturn, at least in tech started by tech in the first
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.840]   quarter of 2022. Here we are in the third quarter, starting in
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.080]   July of 2023. What's your take on what the next six quarters
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.040]   look like? Are we going to be sideways? Are we going to as
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.240]   Chamath saying, hey, there's a lot of people are trying to pay
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   catch up, they missed this bump. And now they're competing and
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.420]   they have to at the end of the year, capital allocators are
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.200]   going to show in their yearly reports what they did this year.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.680]   And now they're like, hey, we got to put some some bets into
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.000]   some high growth companies. Is this the setup for another mania
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.120]   and maybe unhealthy behavior?
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.240]   So Jason, I don't think it's gonna be a mania. But I do think
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.680]   that the market is ripping today because the market is basically
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.160]   pricing in the idea of a soft landing along with inflation
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.680]   being tamed. So you had a positive CPI report at 3%. You
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.160]   had a hot jobs report a week or two ago. And there's a
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.440]   interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today talking
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.200]   about the odds of a soft landing improving. And they have some
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.040]   data for that. I don't particularly agree with the sub
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.600]   headline.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.840]   The trying to latest data suggests a lot of past inflation
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.440]   was transitory. That seems
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   Yeah, that I think is is being too charitable to the Fed.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.400]   Because when they use the word transitory, they were using as
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.800]   an excuse not to raise interest rates. And we just had the
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.320]   fastest rate tightening cycle ever over the past year. That's
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.440]   the reason why inflation has gone down. It was not transitory
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.720]   until they jacked up interest rates from zero to 5%. So the
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.080]   Wall Street Journal, I think is doing a little covering for the
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   Fed there. But nonetheless, I think everybody is pleasantly
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:31.000]   surprised that a CPI is now down to 3%. And B, you have not had a
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.600]   significant cooling of the jobs market. So certainly the odds
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.240]   now of a soft landing have gone up. And the thing that's sort of
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.960]   surprising about what Larry Summers is saying is that if you
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.800]   believe that inflation is going to come roaring back, that's
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.080]   certainly a contrarian bet. That's not what the market is
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.400]   saying right now. What the market is predicting right now,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.640]   and the reason why stocks are rallying is what the market is
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.000]   thinking is, well, if inflation is down to 3%, and we can end
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.280]   the year at three or even lower, then the Fed can start cutting
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.360]   next year. And so they're starting to price in rate cuts.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.400]   But if inflation comes roaring back, you're not gonna get rate
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.280]   cuts. And so stock prices are going to go down. I don't see
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   how you can have a scenario of even higher interest rates from
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.520]   here, along with higher stock prices, I think you need lower
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.560]   rates to get higher stock prices. And one of Brad's charts
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.320]   shows this, if you look at the software index, the median
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   enterprise value divided by next 12 months revenue, what you see
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.920]   here is that the mean multiple is 7.7, excluding the COVID
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.720]   distortion, we're at 6.6. Now, so there is room for the
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.880]   software index to run up pretty nicely here, you could argue
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.360]   that it's undervalued or fairly valued. You see the 10 years at
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.760]   3.8%. If you compare it to where we were before COVID, when
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.920]   interest rates were in the mid twos to around 3%.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.040]   Yeah, we got to an 18x multiple. It was crazy.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.840]   Yeah. So basically, if interest rates go down, I think for sure
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.040]   you'll see multiples go up. But I think if interest rates going
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.400]   to keep going up from here, then you're not gonna get that rally
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.520]   or I don't see why you would
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.360]   well, the thing to keep in mind is I think this chart is not that
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.120]   helpful, because this is all unprofitable software companies.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.400]   So I think the more important thing is to look at the broad
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.000]   based index. The thing with these companies is that even if
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.280]   rates are at 3%, or 6%, or 2%, or 1%, that trick is over, these
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.880]   companies are not going to get out of this cul de sac until
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.040]   they figure out true product market fit, how to eliminate
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.960]   churn, how to drive medium to long term profitability. And
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   most of them, unfortunately, don't have a clear path to that.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.680]   And the problem is all of the old legacy software companies,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.800]   x of Salesforce, have still not got to profitability. So meaning
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   the ones that went public in like the early teens are still
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.720]   sucking wind losing money. So the idea that software
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.880]   businesses generate long term profits is so far, unfortunately,
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.840]   been a fallacy. So that chart, I think will stay exactly the same
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.040]   way it is, I think the bloom is off the roads, but where the
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.480]   money can go, we change that though, Chamath, which would
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.560]   what we need to stop at this point to look talk about the
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   SAS companies, because what would change that if they
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.760]   actually get to profitability? And sex, what's the chances they
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.920]   get to profitability, because that would make them look more
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.080]   like Microsoft or
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.200]   the biggest problem that software as a service businesses
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.000]   have is the same thing that it benefits from, which is cycle
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.120]   time. So the cycle time for a SAS business to build a feature
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.520]   set to get product market fit, and to get early revenue is very
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.760]   short. The problem with that is that is the equivalent amount of
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.680]   time it takes for a competitor or several competitors to
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.840]   compartmentalize and chop and slice and dice that feature set
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.160]   into a bunch of smaller subscale SAS products that then go after
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.200]   it and cannibalize that revenue. So I think the issue that they
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.960]   have is they show contractually, a lot of revenue expansion that
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   looks good on the service. But underneath, these guys are in
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.480]   this constant hamster wheel of trying to build features and
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.080]   trying to keep their head above water. And all of that dreading
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.040]   consumes enormous amounts of cash. And so from an opex
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.960]   perspective, the SAS businesses, they just suck, they don't
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.640]   generate free cash flow, except for a few.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.720]   Let me let me bring sex into the sex. Do you think that these
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.600]   companies will get to having a PE ratio because a lot of times
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.360]   you pull them up and it's like price earnings ratio not
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.840]   applicable for this company, because there are no earnings
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.280]   and you've dedicated your career to SAS and you built a billion
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.680]   dollar company. So give us the other side.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.120]   The other side of it is that software businesses have great
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.880]   gross margins. I mean, you spend all of your R&D creating the
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   first instance of the product and there, thereafter, every
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.120]   additional instance of the product is basically almost free
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.400]   to provision on the margin. So these are super high margin
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.320]   businesses. Once you achieve dominance in your category,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.240]   there's a bunch of different modes, you can create a
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.880]   platform, you have the largest sales and marketing operation.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.840]   Everyone wants to go with the market leader. So there's, you
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.840]   know, a bunch of different ways to lock in your advantage and
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.120]   not all those companies are losing money, a growing number
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.320]   of them are making money. I just think that's like a sweeping
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.400]   overgeneralization. So I still think software businesses are
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.480]   some of the best businesses. But why don't they get earnings?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.280]   We're off on a little bit of a tangent here, which is, I could
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.840]   have shown you a slide of almost any basket of gross stocks. And
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.920]   you would have had something similar, which is, they're still
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.440]   trading below their seven year mean on a multiple basis. And so
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.360]   my point was simply that if interest rates are coming down,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.560]   there is room for these stocks to write about that. Yeah, let
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.680]   me bring freeberg and freeberg in the summer's camp, and some
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.480]   other people's camp. They believe interest rates have to
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.360]   go higher, despite the fact that inflation has plummeted. And it
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.760]   feels like a for pal that this is a mission accomplished
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.960]   moment. The reasons they believe that are the infrastructure and
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.120]   chips bill are going to pour money into the United States.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.320]   And we're gonna have massive spending, we already have absurd
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.160]   50 year low unemployment, which is insane, we still have close
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.480]   to 10 million job openings, we have locked the borders, we now
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.960]   have Democrats and Republicans back to back saying we're not
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.520]   going to let people into the country we've. So I don't know
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.280]   who's going to work in all these factories if we don't have an
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.880]   immigration policy. So maybe you could tell us if you actually
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   believe this sort of let's call it the summers doctrine here or
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.120]   the the contrarian summers position, six, 7% interest rates
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.520]   are coming, because we're going to have persistent inflation.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.920]   And if you believe that contrarian take,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   I think there's a general statement that can be made that
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   we are coming out of a zero interest rate environment into
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:06.160]   which lasted for a very long period of time into a very
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:13.600]   stimulatory environment, because of government spending. And when
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.880]   you have government spending, stimulating the economy, you
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.800]   have a natural market force of inflation coming from the
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.840]   additional capital being pumped into the economy, and the
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.720]   purchasing and, and all that sort of stuff, like you pointed
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.280]   out 50 year low in unemployment, and we're trying to create a
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.680]   bunch of new jobs. And who's going to fill those jobs, you're
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   gonna have to pay people more to get them to take those jobs. So
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.840]   you know, you're gonna see a rising wages, and then you're
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.280]   gonna ask a question as a follow up to that, for a bird, you pay
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.720]   people more, but there's nobody looking for jobs. We're kind of
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.960]   that's I think the conundrum we're in people. You can boost
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.320]   the labor participation rate, right? You can attract more
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.400]   people to the workforce.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.320]   Yeah, and it drives wage growth. But ultimately, keep this in
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.360]   mind. So the lower wage workers, let's use a simple example,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.960]   people that work in fast food, there, if their rates go from,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.600]   you know, eight bucks to 15 bucks to 25 bucks an hour, the
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.920]   cost of fast food goes up. So on the food price index, you'll see
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.560]   a rise in food prices. So right now, it seems like the Fed and
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.600]   the market are all acknowledging and reacting to you know, these
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.360]   these I would kind of argue acute conditions that are being
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.240]   resolved from coming out of the COVID stimulation. But there are
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   in place as the comments have been made, increased spending
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.720]   to NATO because of global security concerns, increased
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.400]   defense spending globally, the current projection from the CBO
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.000]   showing what defense spending is going to be as a percentage of
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.280]   GDP or percentage of government spending. There are some folks
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.120]   as you guys all know, well, do you would speak to in DC who
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.560]   think that those numbers are BS, because we're going to increase
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.240]   defense spending not cut it. Because of global security
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.760]   concerns, particularly as we decouple from China, and all of
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.760]   the energy transition stuff, the IRA, the chips act, which is a
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.280]   security thing. These are all stimulatory. So the tides come
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.160]   in and out, but the sea levels are rising. And over time, that
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.200]   translates into a way to manage the inflation, but also to raise
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.280]   the capital, which means you have to pay higher rates. And
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.960]   this is this is in the EU and the US, that it seems this is
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.880]   going to be the case. So I feel like we've gone in a circle a
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.680]   little bit, which is good, I think, just to show how complex
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.400]   the issue is. And we're trying to predict the weather here, or
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.320]   at least understand the weather patterns. So let's talk about
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.520]   the driving force in this and CPI, the first word is consumer
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.120]   Chamath, stimmy check summer last year and the year before
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.600]   NFT crypto, you know, secure your bag summer, I think was
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.240]   the same sort of phenomenon. And unlimited, you know, double or
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:57.560]   triple bonus unemployment, plus deferring your student loans.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.880]   Those four things were, you know, pretty much defined the
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.640]   last two years, and all of them have come to a crashing halt,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.840]   you can't get unlimited unemployment, you got to start
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.440]   paying your student loans in September, from my
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:14.920]   understanding. And you're paying rent. Oh, yeah. Wow. Crazy
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.360]   concept. You know, so we have five factors there you have to
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.160]   you have to pay your landlord your rent. So let's talk about
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   the consumer for a quick second here. Is this the last hurrah
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.760]   summer, people consumers are going to need to get back to
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.800]   work in September, because it seems like the credit card debts
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.320]   going up. We talked about that over the last year. And if
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.080]   consumers aren't spending, you know, that's going to be the
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.960]   driving force. And that was the goal of raising the interest
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.120]   rates is to maybe get consumers to have a higher car bill, a
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.040]   higher mortgage bill and to get back to work. Yeah, I mean, I
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.120]   think that's very well summarized. I think that we are
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.800]   absorbing all the excess liquidity in the economy that
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.880]   would otherwise have gone into really speculative things. The
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:06.360]   extra vacation, the extra pair of shoes on Stock X or whatever
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.840]   the extra NFT, the extra this the extra that that's all out
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.080]   the window. A traditional home mortgage is probably doubled in
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.520]   terms of your monthly payments. So yeah, people will be forced
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.200]   to get back to work, they'll have to stay in jobs longer,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.360]   they'll have to just do a much better job of managing their
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.520]   finances. But all of that doesn't necessarily mean that
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.920]   the US economy falls off a cliff. I think that the thing we
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.600]   have to remember is that and I don't think we can explain it
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.520]   actually, very well, because every time an economist has
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   tried to do it, I don't think they've really figured this out.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.760]   But we tend to have a very resilient level of consumer
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.880]   demand. And when you look at the correlation between consumer
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.400]   demand and the underlying economy, even in periods of
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.600]   extreme shock, so even like the pandemic is one of those moments
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.560]   where Yeah, the demand fell off a cliff, but that's because we
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.200]   were literally prevented from doing anything, we could not buy
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.400]   the things that we wanted to, right? Or if you even go back to
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.880]   2007 2008, in the great financial crisis, the
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.400]   interesting thing about consumer demand is that it snaps back
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.280]   very quickly. So there's this weird dynamic where folks have a
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.040]   base level of spending, and they use an amount of debt to
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.200]   basically, you know, subsidize that. And then they're willing
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.280]   to work in order to make sure that that doesn't change. And I
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.000]   think that that's what we're getting back to, we're going to
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.240]   get people off the sidelines into the labor market. And yeah,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.680]   I think it's keep going.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.800]   sacks. I think it's all psychology. Like if you're, I
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.200]   think people spending is a function of their optimism. And
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.320]   like maybe their last trade, or their last bank statement. So
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.040]   it's like, oh, my NFT tripled. Therefore, it's going to triple
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.640]   again next month. And hey, there's a chance that my co 10x
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.040]   Oh, I invested in the startup. Oh, you know, I'm getting
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.280]   stimmy checks, I'll get another stimmy check. And now, if they
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.160]   get three or four moments in time where Oh, my NFT is now
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.600]   worth 10%. I can't defer my student loans anymore. Oh, I'm
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.320]   accruing interest. Oh, no, the house I bought now has a 15%
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.920]   mortgage, and I was on variable. So what's your thoughts on the
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.080]   psychology of the consumer here? And is everybody just still
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.760]   spending, but maybe downgrading a little bit? Maybe they buy the
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.720]   Tesla Model three, instead of the, you know, going for the
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.360]   Model S, and they take business class and sitting business
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.640]   class or economy plus they do a staycation and drive somewhere.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.880]   I've been surprised at just how resilient the economy has been.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.320]   I figured that after all the distortions we had in the
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.240]   economy, all the stimulus during COVID, we basically floored the
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.560]   accelerator and then slam on the brakes with this incredibly
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.560]   rapid rate tightening cycle, I thought for sure that was going
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.080]   to basically crash the economy. I was in the Druckenmiller camp
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.720]   on this. But I think, again, what you're seeing over the last
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   few weeks, it's just more and more evidence that it could be a
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:02.760]   soft landing, that we may not have a recession, and we might
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.880]   even get rate cuts next year. But I do think that right now,
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.080]   the risks are probably as balanced as they've been. So if
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.560]   you want to pull up, Nick, can you pull up that chart, the
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.000]   quadrants from the CO2 summit, I thought this was actually a
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.760]   pretty interesting chart that we saw at the CO2 summit as a
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.320]   useful framework for thinking about the scenarios for the
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.920]   economy.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.000]   Sportscast it for the audience listening.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.520]   Yeah, so basically, it's a two by two quadrant, where on one
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.920]   axis, you've got inflation, and inflation can be either low or
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.680]   high based on 3% being the dividing line. And then the
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.400]   economy can be either weak or strong with four and a half
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.440]   percent unemployment being the dividing line. So if you believe
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.880]   that inflation is coming down below 3%, and unemployment is
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.160]   going to stay below four and a half percent, I think it's
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.920]   already at like three and a half percent right now, then you're
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.640]   back in the sustained growth quadrant, in which case the S&P
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.600]   500 is going to keep ripping. On the other hand, if inflation is
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.240]   above 3%, with low unemployment, you're back in the overheating
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.640]   quadrant, which is probably bad for stocks. Now, you could have
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.160]   a situation in which inflation goes down and remains good, but
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.480]   unemployment goes way up, in which case that'd be the hard
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   landing. And then the final quadrant is stagflation, where
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.880]   you've got high inflation and high unemployment. So I think
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.000]   the quadrants right now are probably as balanced as they've
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   been in quite some time in terms of where we could end up in,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.880]   let's say a year.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:31.760]   Yeah, I think that for you, there's some early signals that
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.240]   you can look to to get a sense of where this may be going.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   Disney World is empty, the lines are really short. I don't know
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.120]   if you guys have any friends that have been to Disney World
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.040]   lately or Disneyland.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.200]   It was in the Wall Street Journal, the traffic has fallen
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.720]   off a cliff.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.920]   Yeah. And there's just
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.960]   there's another go broke, go broke company.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.160]   That's a really interesting point is do you think that Disney
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.200]   traffic has gone down because the conservative half of the
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.440]   country basically feels offended? And they're right. A
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.280]   lot, but light? Yes. Or is it a larger consumer spending
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.720]   problem?
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.360]   Everybody everywhere else is still spending like even if you
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.400]   go to like, look at the World Series of Poker main event this
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.960]   year had the historic number of entries, everything is telling
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.560]   you that people are getting their last hurrah. So the fact
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.080]   that Disney has been decaying for the past year, is more
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.160]   emblematic of the fact that they've gotten into this social
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.640]   culture war and half the population of America said,
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.840]   we're not going to support your business, like they did to
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.440]   butt light. And I'm not adjudicating the rightness or
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.200]   wrongness of either Bud Light or Disney. But the answer is in the
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.400]   actual results. The people are not walking into the store just
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.640]   to show this while we're on Disney. So here's a Disney chart
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.360]   for you just to show you the times at the different parks
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.960]   over the years it is in 2023, meaningfully shorter than 2022
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.800]   or pre pandemic. So I don't know if that's a function of their
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.640]   technology that they've been deploying, or if maybe
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.200]   conservatives are not going. But there's also another x factor,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.720]   which is the previous head of Disney who got ousted and Bob
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.360]   Iger's back was the guy who ran parks, and he just leaned into
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.240]   changing the pricing and it got absurdly expensive and they got
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.640]   rid of like, the California pass and all that stuff. So I think
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.720]   the jury's out on this one, Bob Chapin.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.920]   Yeah, but there's a broader consumer spending question that
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.080]   I'm saying there may be some early signals, most consumers
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.360]   rely on credit, as you guys know, interest rates are rising,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.080]   and that passes through to consumers purchasing goods. But
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.680]   other folks look at the metric of consumer credit card balance
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.080]   as a percentage of savings or percentage of earnings, which is
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.640]   actually a little bit lower given wage growth and savings
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.440]   that have accumulated. Regardless, there are other
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.160]   signals we can look to. So if you pull up this chart, this
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.840]   just shows a really important statistic. So 80% of new car
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.360]   purchases are financed, meaning you take out a loan to buy the
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.400]   car 40% of used cars are financed, and interest rates on
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.760]   car loans, as you guys can see in this chart, in just the last
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.000]   year or so, interest rates have spiked from under 4%, call it
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.800]   3.7%, to an average of 7% today. And that obviously translates
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:11.880]   into a doubling of the monthly payment needed to buy a car. And
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.800]   now if you go to the next image, so this is now playing through
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.480]   in terms of used car demand and used car prices. In the last
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.400]   month, it was reported by Cox Automotive that the pricing for
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:28.120]   used cars has declined by 4.2%. And so this starts to indicate
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.400]   that there may be a bit of a softness emerging, we could
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.520]   argue, yes, this is having a positive effect on the
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.120]   inflationary conditions. But it may also be an indication of
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.760]   consumer spending, and that we're starting to get to a point
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.920]   where credit is so expensive, and consumers ability to flex
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.840]   credit is being decreased. And that's starting to translate
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.040]   through into what everyone's been worried about, which is the
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.200]   recessionary or declining effect on revenue, declining effect on
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.520]   profit of companies that are selling goods and services. So
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.280]   that is obviously the challenge to taxes point on that two by
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.720]   two matrix on it, you know, if you if you reduce cost and
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.400]   reduce demand too much, you can have a recessionary effect and
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.360]   consumers are a big driver of this. And so many consumers
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.920]   depend on credit, it's a, it's going to be a big condition to
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.280]   watch.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.120]   Austerity measures are going to happen. Here's the chart of
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.840]   quarterly revenue for Disney. Yeah, still doing great. I
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.320]   bought the stock and it's the one thing in my J trading
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   portfolio, I've gotten crushed on that and Warner Brothers
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.360]   discovery, made two entertainment bets and what I
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.680]   think are the two best companies. I also did Netflix,
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.920]   but one out of three ain't good. Alright, so some breaking news
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.400]   here that we'll try to dovetail together with this. Lena Khan
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.320]   and the FTC losing their Activision case, apparently, and
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.440]   it's breaking news, a partial win is what it looks like. Let
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.200]   me read this here. Judge gives ripple partial win in SEC case
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.080]   over XRP currency ripple labs Inc violated federal securities
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.320]   law in its sale of cryptocurrency XRP directly to
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.240]   sophisticated investors, but it sells on public exchanges did
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.480]   not involve securities a US judge said in a ruling that sent
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.840]   the cryptocurrency soaring XRP was up 25% after the ruling. SEC
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.520]   had accused the company and its current and former chief
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.760]   executives conducting a $1.3 billion unregistered security
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.040]   offering by selling XRP, which ripples founders created in 2012
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.440]   us district judge who was based in New York on Thursday said the
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.360]   company is 728.9 million of XRP sales to hedge funds and other
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.120]   sophisticated buyers amounted to unregistered sales of securities.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:34.480]   But Torres ruled XRP sales on public cryptocurrency exchanges
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.840]   were not offers of securities under the law, because the
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   purchasers did not have a reasonable expectation of profit
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.160]   tied to ripples effort. Okay. Those sales were blind bid as
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   transaction she said, where the buyers could not have known if
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.280]   their payments I'm reading from Reuters here of money went to
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.880]   ripple or any other seller of XRP. Interesting. So the buyer
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.760]   becomes the the person who profits from it becomes the
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.560]   fulcrum here. XRP sales on cryptocurrency platform.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.800]   I'm gonna figure this out in real time. This is too
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.000]   complicated. The bottom line is that the headline is
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   trying to make sure the audience gets it. Yeah.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.240]   Look, the headline is I mean, the tweet ripple sales of XRP do
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.720]   not constitute offer investment contracts. According to judge,
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.880]   they won. There was a huge vindication for them. And that
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.800]   XRP is ripping 35%.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.600]   Yeah. And it really handcuffs the SEC. What are they going to
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.000]   do about Coinbase and every other exchange? I mean, if
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.800]   they're not selling securities, I think Coinbase and everybody
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.280]   else has always maintained they're selling tokens. This
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.680]   is the this was the fulcrum argument for the SEC and they
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.800]   just they just lost.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.560]   The whole crypto market is ripping right now.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.720]   It's an interesting one. The confounding part of this is that
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.920]   the initial sale to accredited investors and hedge funds was
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.720]   done. That they violated securities law there when they
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.640]   were selling directly to sophisticated investors. I just
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.720]   looking at it logically, you would think it was the reverse.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.440]   But this is a fascinating turn of events.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   I just texted with Brad Garlinghouse. And he says, Yes,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.640]   it does mean that they won. And he feels vindicated, vindicated
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.840]   and really happy.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.200]   About the future. J. Co.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.040]   Well, I feel like I'm going to launch J coin and sell a token
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.960]   to back startups. I mean, if it's a free for all, I will
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   tell you tell you what he said.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.760]   No, I mean,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.240]   I said you were using these guys as security fraud for like,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.880]   I think it is. They've been convicted of securities fraud
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.120]   here. So that's the judgment. ripple violated federal
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.240]   securities law and it's sell a cryptocurrency, the first line
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.400]   of the story that there's two judgments here, they violated
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.360]   federal securities on sale of cryptocurrency extra fee
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.640]   directly to sophisticated investors. But the sales on
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.440]   public exchanges did not involve securities. So what they're
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.400]   saying is, if you sold XRP to hedge funds, that was a
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.360]   security when they did the first offering. But when the public
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.280]   started trading it on public exchanges, they did not have
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.240]   according to the Howie test. This belief
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.200]   that that's where their vulnerability was, because if
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.440]   you sell to a professional hedge fund, they're accredited,
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.400]   that should not be an issue, you should be able to sell to
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.120]   write. So what's the problem? This is a
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.400]   general for them. The judge says they
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.680]   sound pretty happy. And the market seems to be indicating
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.720]   that this is the I mean, would you say the price is up 35%?
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.840]   Well, I mean,
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.280]   37% right now crypto trades, I wouldn't necessarily put too
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.720]   much on it. I would look at the the actual judgment here. But we
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.040]   all know people trade headlines. So let's let's see where it's
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.000]   at in five days. But
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.920]   a bunch of the alt coins are ripping right now.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.640]   Oh, boy, here we go.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.080]   It's a judgment that seems to indicate for a lot of folks that
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.880]   these are not going to be treated as securities. I think
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.720]   that this is a really important. Just think about how amazing the
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:50.400]   United States is that the government agencies, the
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.040]   administration in power can come after corporations. And then we
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.280]   have a court system that can adjudicate and make decisions
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.720]   that follow the rule of law. I know we're going to talk about
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.360]   Lena Khan and her agency's efforts at litigation. But I'm
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.560]   really encouraged at the fact that the court system in the
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.600]   United States doesn't just kowtow to whatever
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.200]   administration is in power at that moment, that they do
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.960]   adjudicate by the law, and ultimately provide greater
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.160]   clarity for business for individuals to operate going
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.520]   forward that there is a better sense now for the market.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.280]   There's a better sense now for individuals on what is an
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.000]   appropriate hour have they always a check and balance, right?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.120]   And that's the way I think that's what's so great is that
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.920]   there's now clarity because the courts provided that Yeah,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.480]   has this trend changed? I thought they thought America
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.120]   always did that.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.960]   Yeah, I think it's great. I think it's look, because you
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.360]   have you obviously have a very zealous administration, and a
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.080]   very zealous agency leader who is testing the boundaries. And
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.360]   you know, Lena Khan agency is pushing the limits on what
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.640]   constitutes antitrust. And in the effort to try and push those
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   boundaries, there is a pushback from the courts. Nobody
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.480]   includes Ben Gensler in the SEC. It's been getting on. Yeah,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.120]   sorry. Yeah. But but both agencies, right. And so it's
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.400]   good to see that there's clarity emerging and that the courts do
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.240]   their job. And that the administration's come in. I
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.480]   think the lead thing is, yeah, very different. I think this was
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.800]   a nuanced argument that the SEC made that required a highly
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.200]   sophisticated interpretation of securities law. And you're
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.120]   supposed to go to the courts for that. I think what the FTC has
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.000]   been doing is basically just emotionally reactive lawsuit
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:33.400]   filing.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.720]   Right. So let me just pivot over to Lena Khan's losing streak
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.240]   here on Tuesday morning, a federal judge denied the FTC is
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.720]   attempt to delay Microsoft $70 billion acquisition of
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   Activision Blizzard. And the FTC is arguments basically,
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.680]   Microsoft should not be allowed to acquire Activision because it
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.560]   would make Activision score assets, which is basically Call
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.280]   of Duty, one of the greatest franchises in the history of
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.240]   franchises, movies, or television shows or video games,
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.080]   and that it would be exclusive to the Xbox Satya Nadella and
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.120]   Xbox head Phil Spencer, both said under oath, they could not
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.560]   make COD and exclusive and they wouldn't. And not only that,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.200]   they said they would allow it made no sense. I mean, they also
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.120]   said they would put it on Nintendo, which chorus because
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.040]   Activision hands on Sony, because Nintendo and Sony are
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   the other number one and number two players in this market. And
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.760]   Sony alone is basically 50% of the market. So I think like, the
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.200]   crazy thing about all of this is if you look at the legal
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.600]   strategy of the FTC, it's basically that they view
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.720]   themselves as a hammer. And every deal, particularly if it's
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.520]   done by big tech is a nail. And so you know, Amazon Roomba
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.960]   lawsuit, Facebook, some rando little company, lawsuit,
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.320]   Microsoft Activision lawsuit, and it's that emotional
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:00.680]   reactivity that takes away faith and trust that this organization
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.960]   is intelligent, and sober and well run. And that's the shame
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.400]   of it. Because if you actually look across all of the deals in
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.040]   tech that have happened recently, this deal was frankly
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.640]   DOA from the start from a regulatory blocking perspective,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.320]   because of what I just said, the number three player a distant
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.440]   third, buying an asset, why would you take an asset that you
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.000]   pay $70 billion for an immediately turn it off from 50%
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   of all consoles, nobody would do that.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.880]   Hey, sacks, when we look at this, and let's widen this
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.280]   aperture to the faith and institutions, because we have
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:40.040]   the Gary Gensler, hey, do we actually believe that they're
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.400]   acting in good faith? Or are they trying to protect fiat
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   currency, and not let an alternative currency take some
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.240]   control, and sort of be a backstop against their behavior
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.560]   in the money printing machine, which is cryptos, you know, big
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.160]   sort of, let's call it the biology position. And then, in
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.400]   this case, Lena Khan was selected handpicked as a 32 year
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.680]   old wonder kid, who had this incredible thesis that she could
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.560]   predict, who would compete in the future, she was like a
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.920]   minority report, free con, she alone could decide, you know,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:16.560]   who how these competitions would emerge, and she keeps losing. So
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.840]   these two institutions now being used for political purposes by
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   the Biden administration, or do you think that they're just
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.360]   poorly executing? What's your take?
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.840]   Well, I think clearly, the legal strategy that Lena Khan has
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.600]   been pursuing is not having much success in the courts. I mean,
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.480]   she just lost this big decision on the Microsoft acquisition of
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.080]   Activision. But that being said, I'm almost starting to feel bad
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.960]   for her. Because although some of her legal theories may be
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.360]   flawed, I do think that these big tech companies like Google
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.000]   and Microsoft do need to check on their power. And so what I
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.680]   would urge is that Lena Khan needs to regroup, maybe figure
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.640]   out a different legal strategy, figure out a different way to
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.360]   take on big tech, because someone does need to cut these
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.480]   big tech companies down to size. They are giant monopolies, and
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.960]   they do need to be restrained and controlled, or they will
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.720]   basically consolidate the whole tech ecosystem and abuse their
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.440]   market power. So I think it's actually pretty vital that we
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.400]   have a regulator who is energetic in wanting to check
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.480]   the power of big tech, I think maybe trying to put a damper on
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.120]   M&A was the wrong way to do it. We've talked about this before
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.360]   needs to be more surgical, right? There's so few ways to
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.400]   have a good exit in the tech industry that when you take
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.080]   away M&A, it puts a damper on all risk taking and the
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.520]   deployment of risk capital into the ecosystem. So I think it was
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.640]   having too big of a chilling effect. So I think she needs to
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.800]   move away from these M&A cases, unless it's a very, very clear
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.680]   case. But I think where she can be more aggressive is on
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.040]   restraining anti competitive tactics, and also maybe busting
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.400]   up these companies, you know, I'm thinking more and more about
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.000]   this Google case that she has, where she wants to basically
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.760]   break up the company, because they've got this monopoly, not
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.840]   just in search, but also in advertising, maybe that's a good
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.800]   thing. And maybe Amazon should have to spin out AWS, maybe
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.560]   Google should have to spin out YouTube, because I do think they
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.080]   are abusive in the way they exercise their authority. As a
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.760]   small example, over the past week, YouTube just banned a
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:31.120]   video of Jordan Peterson interviewing RFK Jr. Why? What
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.000]   gives them the power to interfere in our democracy that
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.920]   way where they just decide for their own reasons, that the
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.840]   public can't watch a video of Jordan Peterson interviewing
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.320]   RFK?
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.160]   Well, when the
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.360]   didn't the Supreme Court just say, private companies can serve
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.880]   customers however they want. If you want a gay cake, you add a
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.720]   baker doesn't have to make it isn't the same analogy.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.800]   No, I don't think it's the same principle. These are huge
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.360]   monopolies that have tremendous market power that are
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.480]   inspiring companies can choose their customers and products,
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.000]   but the big company has a more of a responsibility to be an
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.160]   open platform in your mind.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.320]   Yeah, that's the common carrier argument. Yeah, my point is
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.960]   just, they have tremendous market power that they abuse in
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.040]   arbitrary ways.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.600]   You have to admit sacks there. Her lawsuit strategy is
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.160]   scattershot.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.080]   It's a little bit spray and pray.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.280]   In fairness to her, she said she was gonna do that. For example,
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.880]   like, but where's the I agree with you, like, where's the
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.080]   lawsuit on Adobe figma? That seems like a more obvious one,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.560]   you have the number one and the number two, right? There's a
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.960]   clear number one monopoly buying the number two. And so that
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.080]   could be more market consolidation than a number
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.160]   three player buying
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.320]   not a gaming company that the public doesn't know those names
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   and Biden put her in there to be anti tech, but I think
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.600]   you're anti well, this is a what her but no, I just want to tell
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.920]   you, her position has also been driven by wealth inequality,
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.360]   which is not the mandate of the FTC. I think that's why she's
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.280]   the worst modern day FTC head. I'll say it again. Because she
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.720]   should be looking at tactics. And the tactics she should do is
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.320]   the App Store on iOS should be open to other app stores.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.520]   Amazon, you know, is open to third party sellers, they should
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.200]   be looking at the bundling of Microsoft teams and say, you
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.880]   know what, because you have a monopoly position, you can't add
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.200]   things to the bundle without charging for them. So if you
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.560]   want to include Microsoft teams, you got to put a price on it.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.280]   And the price has to be a fair market price because you're
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.760]   doing product dumping, you're dumping into the market a free
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.360]   product with your market position. Instead, when they
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:31.080]   launch that the settlement should be Microsoft team should
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.880]   be plus $8 per month per person plus $4. But it shouldn't be
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.120]   allowed to dump products onto the market. I think the tactical
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:38.400]   stuff.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.080]   You think that I got a response. Okay, freeberg first chamath
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.480]   sacks. freeberg. I'm just asking why, like, why wouldn't it be
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.920]   okay for Microsoft to put a cheap product out if someone
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.720]   makes an alternative to teams, that is a better product with
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   more features and they charge for it and people are willing to
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.240]   pay for it. They'll win in the market
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   because of bundling, bundling and product dumping is illegal
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.440]   according to the laws in the United States.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.320]   But I'm asking you think that's why I agree with that. Yeah,
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.600]   it's a form of bundling. You got to make that argument. But yes,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.680]   I agree with that. But look, the way I judge these things is
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.680]   what is good for the ultimate health of the startup ecosystem,
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.640]   because entrepreneurship is the thing that we should be
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:22.360]   optimizing for not the power or wealth of big companies, but the
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.440]   vibrancy and dynamism of the startup ecosystem as a whole.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.800]   Because I think that long term, that's what leads to the
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.920]   creation of new big companies. That's what's good for America.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.600]   I cosine.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.800]   Yeah. So with FTC, I think Lena Khan hasn't gotten the formula
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.600]   right. I think she's challenging some of the wrong M&A deals. But
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.840]   like I said, I'd like to see her regroup and figure out how to
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.200]   take on these big companies because I do think they have to
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.440]   be restraint. On the other hand, what's happening with SEC and
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.920]   operation choke point is, I think they would have basically
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.200]   put the kibosh on the whole crypto ecosystem. I mean, if you
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.200]   basically come out and say that there's no such thing as a token
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   that every single token is basically a security, then
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.000]   that's the end of crypto as a potential center of innovation.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.240]   Now, we can argue about what the utility of it is, we can argue
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.840]   about whether there's long term going to be anything there. I
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.480]   don't really know for sure. But I would like the United States to
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.280]   be the place where we figured this out, not driving it
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.640]   overseas. So I'm happy that the judge found in favor of ripple
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.920]   without knowing anything specifically about what ripple
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.840]   did, and I'm not endorsing their behavior or tactics or whatever.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.120]   But I'm happy that there is now a precedent that says that you
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.400]   can have a token like XRP that is not a security, because that
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.440]   is going to enable more innovation in the ecosystem
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   because it was really going the other way before. And my critique
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.360]   of what the SEC was doing is they were basically seizing
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.920]   power that they did not have. I mean, basically Gensler
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:55.520]   unilaterally, was telling Americans that they cannot hold
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   or buy or trade crypto because when you say that every token is
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.160]   a security and they can't operate on exchanges, you're
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.240]   basically saying that Americans don't have the right to engage
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.040]   in crypto. And I think that was basically a bridge too far.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.480]   Tremont, you wanted to get in on that?
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.800]   Well, I just think that part of the thing that I think maybe the
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.920]   FTC suffers from is that being a con is a very young academic,
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:25.480]   and maybe what we need to have a little bit more of a higher
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.720]   batting average or slugging percentage here is just to
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.120]   actually have somebody that understands how business works.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.600]   Because I think the scattershot approach doesn't do much. And I
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.320]   think it just wastes taxpayer money by funding these frivolous
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.360]   lawsuits that then sophisticated organizations like Microsoft,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.480]   and meta just when, and so where does it leave us it weakens the
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.160]   institution, it makes the laws, frankly, not enforced where they
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:53.320]   need to be. And the whole point is not a marketing exercise or a
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.280]   PR exercise to go after companies you dislike, but to
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.920]   actually enforce the laws of capitalism and market dynamism.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:05.040]   And so to not do that, I think is very egotistical. I think
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.680]   it's emotional. And I think it sets the US back, because the
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:12.240]   things that should get stopped don't. And then all this other
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.120]   stuff is just a red herring and a waste of time and taxpayer
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   money.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.320]   I think you're absolutely nailed it there. I think both of you
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.200]   know that sax and trim off there, I think she needs to
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.320]   focus on product dumping, you can pull up the screenshot here.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:27.000]   predatory or below cost pricing is well within the FTC is
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.760]   mandate, you can go look up just type in predator below cost
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.920]   pricing FTC, and you can read all about it. It's absolutely
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.960]   clear that you cannot put products out there at a lower
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.840]   price. And so you have to have a granular discussion is teams
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.160]   Microsoft Teams, a product or a feature, I think we all know
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.080]   it's a product. And so that's an easy win for her
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:50.480]   interoperability. Should Android people be not allowed to use I
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.200]   message? Should people on iOS not be able to use the Play
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:58.640]   Store or buy digital assets from Amazon, obviously, Apple should
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.880]   be stopped there. So interoperability. And then
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.360]   there's one that's a such a clear, easy layup for her. And
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.560]   you know, we'd all like to see her succeed. But I think she is
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.840]   absolutely doing Biden's bidding with an anti tech, anti wealth
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.680]   creation, anti capitalism, frankly, pro union punishment. I
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.240]   think this is punishment for tech being too successful. I
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.880]   don't think it's logical. If you really want to get them go after
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.000]   dark patterns. And if you don't know what dark patterns are,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.520]   that's when you subscribe for the Wall Street fucking journal
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.840]   online, and then you have to call them to unsubscribe. And
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.120]   there are so many dark patterns. And I think Amazon's getting in
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.000]   trouble for this for prime, one of the most loved products of
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.720]   all time, obviously. But dark patterns could be stopped by the
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   FTC. And that's where they can really, really do damage. I
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.800]   heard today that they're investigating chat GPT for
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.680]   giving out wrong answers. It says right on it, it's going to
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.240]   hallucinate and give you a wrong examples. This is an experiment.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.480]   Another example of the FTC going after, you know, the wrong
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.200]   thing. So just I think she needs a sniper rifle, not a shotgun.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:03.400]   And she's got it needs to get a kill shot. Where's the kill shot
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.000]   coming from?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.440]   Let's kill Google.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.400]   Well, yeah, I mean, that was pretty controversial. When you
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.320]   said blow it up. I mean, I would love to hear you say more on
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.800]   that. Yeah.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:17.200]   Well, I paraphrased a line from RFK Jr. Who is paraphrasing a
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.280]   line from JFK, which is you want to shout out the CIA into 1000
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.520]   pieces and scatter to the winds. I said that after they banned
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.480]   the Jordan Peterson RFK interview, that we should
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.920]   shatter Google into 1000 pieces and scatter to the winds and
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.160]   that thing went massively viral. There's a big part of this
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.620]   country that is really pissed at Google and the way they're
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.400]   exercising their arbitrary power. How many did get 12,000
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.960]   like, I just think that the people running that company, I
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.640]   don't understand how they make these decisions. Just makes no
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:44.960]   sense.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.120]   Well, Freiburg, you work there. What are your thoughts on
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.840]   breaking up Google and how they make decisions?
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:55.600]   Look, I'm a free market guy. As you guys know, I think that
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.640]   consumers vote with their dollars and their eyeballs and
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.840]   their time. And ultimately, as we see with Disneyland, and
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.200]   Disney World, if people don't like the behavior of a business,
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.480]   they're gonna stop giving their time and their money to that
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:10.960]   business.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.320]   By the way, freeberg, were you shocked at the fall off in
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:13.880]   traffic?
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.400]   You did I actually immediately thought I'm going to take my
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.120]   kids to Disneyland.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.320]   Yeah, wait time's down. Please, Republicans stay home. Disney
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:22.800]   hates you.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:27.520]   You guys know how expensive the VIP tour thing. It's so
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.000]   expensive. And I'm like, man, if I could to stop being so cheap.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.240]   Number one problem we have with you is that you're driving a 12
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.440]   year old Audi that gets six miles to the gallon when you
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:37.600]   can
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.160]   break car. I love the Audi RS seven.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:46.040]   A hole in the ozone you hypocrite. And you're a
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.760]   hypocrite because you should you deserve that. You deserve that.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.120]   What is it $10,000 for the day to bring your kids to Disneyland
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:57.160]   VIP or you could just hire somebody in a wheelchair.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:00.280]   It's ridiculous the the cost but yeah, you get to cut all the
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   lines and everything. I think it's also I generally don't love
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.200]   the crowds. So if it's going to be less crowded, I'm more
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.720]   interested in taking my kids there. It's already hard enough
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.720]   to deal with, you know,
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.120]   so speaking of your freeberg made this point about the
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.880]   administration being overzealous. Did you guys see
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.840]   this article on the glut of electric cars that are piling up
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.640]   now? Yeah, on dealers lots? Yeah, we shift gears to this, by
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.800]   the way, I think this is a big part of what I said earlier
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.320]   about interest rates on car loans. No, this is a this
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.840]   specific thing is more because of the bureaucracy of the
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.400]   government not allowing these credits to beg basically work
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   across all different kinds of cars. This, this should not
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.800]   exist for the reason this is not a demand issue. This is
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.120]   shit here's to the car. Yeah, government intervention and
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.240]   market dynamics. Is that the driver?
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:47.960]   Yeah, so Axio. So it says here, the legacy auto industry is
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   beginning to crank out more EVs to challenge Tesla. But there's
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.500]   one big problem, not enough buyers. There's a growing
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.760]   mismatch between EV supply and demand. Even though consumers
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.920]   are showing more interest in EVs are still worried about
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   purchasing one because of either price or charging
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:08.840]   concerns, range, anxiety. Yeah, a lot of these new companies
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.680]   that are they're not new companies, but they're new to
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.960]   EVs don't have charging networks. Yep.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:19.000]   That's an issue. And then also, if you've never owned an EV, and
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.360]   you don't live in a city, because now we're going down the
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.680]   curve of people who live outside of cities. And you see 200 mile
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.800]   range, you remember your trip where you drove 300 miles or 400
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.640]   miles, and you're like, well, then I can't have this car. If
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.080]   you have a Tesla, you obviously can. But then Tesla also made
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.880]   the chess move of lowering their prices and having record sales.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.200]   So their margin went down, but their sales went up. And
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.720]   everybody can wait a year. Like that's I think that people don't
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.360]   realize about cars, you can always get another year out of
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.120]   your current car.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.920]   So according to this article, the nationwide supply of EVs in
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.600]   stock has grown nearly 350% this year to more than 92,000 units,
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:02.760]   which is a 92 day supply of EVs. Whereas by comparison, dealers
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:08.280]   have 54 days worth of gasoline powered cars in inventory. So
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.120]   even though interest is growing in EVs, or simply too much
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.680]   supply, too much supply, it's because all these other
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.880]   companies like Ford and GE are now producing tons of EVs, but
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.440]   they don't have the charging networks. And they're new to the
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.120]   EV game, and they don't really produce great cars, great EVs.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.400]   Tesla does not have this problem, by the way. And what I
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.960]   come back to is just the administration's industrial
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.880]   policy. I mean, the administration just gave all
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.120]   these subsidies and credits to big companies like Ford and GE
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.840]   to make EVs. But no one wants those cars. Yep.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.720]   The other problem,
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.600]   and so they're actually interfering in a free market
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.240]   where Tesla is the big winner, because they took a huge risk
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.000]   and create a product people wanted. And now you've got these
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.080]   big stodgy old companies trying to catch up, but no one wants
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.800]   their cars.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.400]   And the administration, which is pro union is anti Tesla, because
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.400]   they don't have a union. And so they put the thumb on the scale
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   and give them the credits instead of giving the credits to
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.360]   Tesla, although Tesla lowered the prices, and I think they now
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.920]   qualify. But the prices are so low for Tesla and the cars are
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.000]   so sophisticated. Listen, not to talk up our guys book, but I
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.760]   think the other big issue here that's not mentioned in the
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.520]   story is interest rates. I mean, if you could give these things
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.760]   away at 2%, 3%, 4% interest rates, that's a big difference,
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:29.160]   isn't it?
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.840]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:31.840]   monthly car payment,
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.520]   80% of new cars are financed.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.040]   Okay, so that's the beginning and end of this probably, I
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.760]   mean, it's three factors going on
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   and interest rates on auto loans have doubled like the chart I
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.320]   showed. So you know, it's it's a huge impact on demand overall.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.400]   And it's not, you know, if you know, the adoption curve of
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.880]   technology, I think we're getting into the big middle, the
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.480]   fat middle and then going to the laggards and the laggards want
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.800]   an F 150 or a Cybertruck. And until those emerge or a
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.520]   suburban that's electric, you know, three rows with a lot of
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.560]   storage, those those don't exist yet.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.920]   Alright, so Jay, let me ask you a question. Okay, so you've got
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.120]   an administration that is overzealous, as freeberg said on
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.560]   industrial policy, basically subsidizing these like old
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.600]   stodgy, broken companies, like Ford at the expense of
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:23.960]   innovators like Tesla, they are bringing a bunch of anti M&A FTC
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:28.480]   lawsuits that you don't like, they are cracking down on
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.440]   crypto, which you may like, but in an overly aggressive way, the
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:32.560]   course is throwing that out.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.480]   I would like to have the rules fair.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.040]   Finish saying, keep going, yeah,
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.800]   we've just gotten off of a one to two year spike in inflation
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.640]   caused by runaway deficit spending and over stimulus. So
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:51.200]   my question to you is, is the economy doing so well because of
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.960]   or in spite of this administration?
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.440]   I think it's a innovators and consumers drive the economy. I
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:02.840]   think I voted for Biden and over Trump because I think Trump
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.160]   would have stolen the election and as a treasonous felon,
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:11.080]   felonious, horrible human being. And I thought it was
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.400]   existential crisis for America. Now, if you could put up a
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.840]   Republican candidate like Chris Christie, who I just mooch
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.680]   scaramouche, just put me in touch with Chris Christie's
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.280]   coming on the show. So Nikki Haley, Chris Christie are coming
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.320]   on the show, you couldn't deliver, you couldn't deliver
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.240]   to Santa's for the show. So I will deliver Chris Christie and
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:29.000]   Shamath is going to deliver Nikki Haley. I'm going to vote.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.200]   I'm giving my announcement now. If Chris, I'm going to vote for
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.040]   Chris Christie, I think.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.480]   I think Chris Christie subject I wasn't asking you about. I mean,
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.280]   I was asking you about whether you think the administration is
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.120]   helping the economy or hurting the economy.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.880]   I think the runaway spending to freebergs point last year is
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.560]   made me a single issue voter. And I think that their spending
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.800]   disqualifies them from voting for them. I need somebody who's
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.320]   going to balance the budget or get this spending. I love you
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.840]   now. Oh my god. No, I mean, I can agree with you on some
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.400]   things. I'm like Han Solo. You're like c3po. I need you to
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.000]   navigate an asteroid field. But I need you to also just shut the
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.160]   fuck up when I'm doing it. Okay, so just let me cook as the
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.800]   world's greatest moderator. Now I do agree with you on this.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.400]   You're, you're absolutely correct. If we don't get the
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:19.120]   balance sheet, right, nothing else matters. And I don't think
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.800]   Trump's crazy spending and Biden's crazy spending is not
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.720]   going to get us out of this. We need somebody to control
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.640]   spending, period full stop. I don't know how you were. How are
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:31.440]   you guys feeling about the election at this point? I guess
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.520]   we could just read that book, the deficit myth. Okay. That
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:37.760]   book is the problem. It's, it's that we can always just issue
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.200]   money, because we are the currency that everyone wants to
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:47.200]   hold. And the flawed logic is that we are the currency that
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.360]   everyone wants to hold until we issued too much debt.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.840]   We have rehashed this. I mean, the interest payments, I think
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.200]   are the backstop Chamath when we start hitting those interest
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.200]   payments, people are going to start going, we're paying more
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:00.720]   in interest, just like people with their home mortgages are
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.160]   like, you know, I should have bought a smaller house. Because
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.920]   I'm paying so much in interest, I should have bought a model
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.120]   three instead of a model x I over I overspent. So is that
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.080]   going to be the backstop for the United States itself? Is there
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.760]   any path to controlling spending? Is there any candidate
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.840]   who will get spending under control? Or is it just
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.400]   too unpopular? RFK? You think? Okay. And the reason is because
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:24.240]   he's so against the military industrial complex, and he wants
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:28.000]   to pass an executive order that bans pharmaceutical advertising,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.280]   those things would have a pretty large ripple effect in the
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.240]   economy, and in spending and in entitlements. So be interesting
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:40.040]   to let it play out. All right, so really care about. Yeah, those
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.920]   things would be pretty meaningful changes.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.840]   sacks, anything from you on any theory on how we could control
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.640]   spending in this country? If there's any backstop, ie, my
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.160]   theory, when we start paying huge interest payments, maybe we
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:56.280]   get our act together. There any candidate at the end of the day,
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.360]   the market's probably going to impose discipline on us. That's
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.680]   sort of my point. Yeah, yeah, you're right. The cost of
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.240]   borrowing will become so painful.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.160]   That is the argument that Larry Summers and other contrarian
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:11.080]   economists contrarian to the administration's policy have been
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.600]   making. I'm sorry, I don't want to put that in his mouth. But
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.920]   that the cost of borrowing is going to be high as long as
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.560]   spending remains high. And so when you see security and
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.480]   climate transition, type and simulatory spending going on
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.240]   chips, act IRA, all this sort of stuff, it's not cost free, you
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.840]   have to pay more to the buyers of your debt.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:36.880]   Yeah, I mean, can speak to this. The vague, you know, it's always
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.440]   if you replace a lot of beds, the vague doesn't go down, it
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.960]   goes up when the debt goes up. So anyway,
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.680]   just on the market imposing discipline on the federal
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.440]   government, you know, one of the things we've talked about is
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.240]   whether there could ever be an alternative reserve currency.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.680]   And the theory was that as problematic as the US fiscal
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.400]   situation is, there's no real alternative to the US dollar,
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.480]   the BRICS countries are about to introduce an alternative
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.360]   currency that's based on gold. So it seems like what the BRICS
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.480]   countries would like to do is use gold,
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.760]   go back to the gold standard,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.680]   gold certificates, as an alternative, that's basically
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.600]   what we're talking about. So it's announced, they're gonna be
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.480]   rolling this out, we haven't yet seen how or what the details are
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.240]   going to be. But
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.120]   that's scarcity built into it.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.040]   That would be the alternative is you go back to the gold standard
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.160]   and the BRICS countries move to that. Now, I know a lot of
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.120]   people may not think that's much of a threat. But I was reading
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.440]   actually some really interesting articles about how big the BRICS
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.280]   countries are now. And if you look at them on a purchasing
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.560]   power parity basis, the BRICS countries just surpassed the g
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:51.520]   seven in terms of GDP. So if you if you measure the size of their
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.040]   economies based on exchange rates, then the g seven is still
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.080]   bigger. But if you look at in terms of PPP, actually, the
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.560]   BRICS are now bigger than the g seven,
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.200]   and growing faster, just and then for people who are catching
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.520]   up Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other what are considered
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.240]   emerging markets, but are quickly
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:11.800]   resuming,
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.520]   yeah, Brazil, Russia, India, China, BRICS.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.040]   And there's more who want to join
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.480]   with this ripple ruling. I think this becomes a boon for people
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.000]   to say, well, the scarcity of Bitcoin and Bitcoin stability, I
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.480]   think, where it's trading right around 30k between the 10k
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.120]   previous average and the 60k peak, maybe that becomes the
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.560]   gold standard in the future. And, you know, if people can
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.680]   feel a little bit more secure in it, now, are we going to see
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.120]   like 10 counter lawsuits, and everybody is just going to sue
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.400]   the SEC and stand up for themselves. I think that's
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.160]   what's going to happen now that if ripple wins this, or you
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.440]   know, if this ripple thing does work out appeals, whatever.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.880]   Then for sure standard procedure is there. No
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.040]   settlements. And I think that's what M&A is going to happen. All
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.120]   M&A. It's like, well, now the settlement is off the table,
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.120]   we're gonna fight. And you know what, you can afford a lot of
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.680]   lawyers if you sold a lot of tokens, or you're a big money
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.760]   printing machine, quick plug for the summit go.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:14.240]   Yeah, well, we have, at this point, the ability to announce a
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.000]   bunch of our speakers for the summit, which is super exciting.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.440]   That I put in like some Tiffany here.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:27.360]   So we have Toby from Shopify, Stephen Wolfram, of Wolfram
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.520]   Alpha Mathematica, obviously, Mr. Beast, everyone knows Mr.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.160]   Beast, Mr. Beast is coming. Mr. Beast is coming.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.440]   In the green room. Can I ask him take a picture of my daughters?
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.240]   You can do it. Yeah, I can. Okay, cool.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.680]   I think it'll be interesting to ask Toby. I tweeted this out
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:47.000]   this whole thing that he did where he canceled everybody's
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.080]   meetings and then forced people to reset it with a little
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.480]   calculator that shows how much money that meeting costs in
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:53.920]   terms of
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.720]   in the Google Calendar to it's like this meeting cost $3,000.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.680]   He's launched he launched this AI thing called the sidekick.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.640]   It's awesome. It's like all board meetings. Yeah, if you're
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.040]   like, basically, it also tells you how to do basic stuff that
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.680]   you need to do to get your business set up. It's
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.080]   fantastic. We'll reconfigure a website in real time to increase
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.440]   sales. It'll tell you why sales are falling off a cliff. It's
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.880]   like you're a little you know, and he said like, every
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.160]   superhero needs a sidekick and Robin boom. So we got Rob
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.200]   Henderson, Nikki Paul, Vinod Khosla, Bob Mungard from
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.040]   Commonwealth Fusion, Jenny just Brian Armstrong, Alexandra
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.640]   Botez of the Botez sisters, famous chess dreamers. We have
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.360]   the fifth bestie Brad Gerstner, Larry Summers, and a few others
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.960]   that we can't announce just yet. We'll announce closer to the
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.200]   summit or at the summit. We reserved 100 general admission
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.280]   tickets for after we announce speakers. So we're going to
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.440]   update the website with the speakers. And we're reopening ga
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.000]   ticket sales until those 100 final tickets are sold out. So
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.600]   if interested in joining us, it's going to be a fantastic
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.320]   event. Jason organizing amazing parties all three nights, Sunday,
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.800]   Monday, Tuesday night. Can't wait to find out about them.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.160]   I'll tell you the great great speakers. Yeah, go for it.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.800]   First first night's party. And when this is subject to change,
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.960]   is the bestie who loved me. Casino Royale, James Bond, where
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.320]   your best James Bond, tuxedo play roulette, Baccarat,
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:30.720]   whatever. White bow ties. Yes, exactly. Second night party is
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.200]   gonna be bestie club, like the breakfast club. 80s big 80s.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.320]   Where your best fight club where people get in the best and then
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.880]   the last night the rave and we're gonna go late. Don't know
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.640]   how late we're gonna go late. We're gonna have a rave. It's
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:51.000]   gonna be bestie runner, a Blade Runner cyberpunk send up where
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.640]   your best Blade Runner cyberpunk rave outfit, Saks is going to
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   dress like the fifth element. Red meat for Saks and for J
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.960]   Cal to a certain extent, there are no winners in war. NATO has
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.920]   brought Sweden and obviously Finland came in right before
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.880]   them because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. And here we go.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.720]   Zelensky denounced the NATO alliances administration policy
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.480]   as absurd and disrespectful. First sentence of Saks is very
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.000]   long tweet storm despite Biden's best efforts to put a happy face
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.200]   on it villainous will be remembered as the NATO summit
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.840]   where tensions boiled over. Obviously, this photo has become
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.480]   a bit of a meme. thrown up on the screen right here. So
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.480]   Lenski, literally, not figuratively having NATO turn
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.120]   his back on him on stage from being the cause celeb last year
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:45.400]   to everybody I you know, and again, it's it's just a picture.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   There was a I would say a press conference with Biden who said
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.680]   Zelensky was stuck with the US. And I'll let Saks take it from
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:00.000]   there. These NATO meetings are supposed to be symbols of unity
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.760]   and harmony and the Alliance coming together to show how on
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.760]   the same page they are. And this meeting, it's sort of ended up
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.920]   there, but it's not the way it started. Zelensky had been told
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.400]   the Ukrainians have been told before the summit that there
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.320]   would not be a timetable for their admission to NATO on the
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.200]   agenda. Stoltenberg had said it weeks ago, Biden said it weeks
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.760]   ago, this controversy had played out already in the pages of the
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.720]   New York Times and other publications. So he knew that
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.280]   they would not be on the agenda. And yet he went into the meeting
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.240]   demanding that they put it on the agenda trying to muscle his
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.320]   way into admission into NATO, which Biden I think to his
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.760]   credit, has resisted because Biden understands that this is
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.680]   an escalation that could lead to World War Three. As Biden
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.760]   explained, the members of NATO have an article five commitment
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.720]   to defend each other's territory. So if Ukraine is
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:58.160]   admitted to NATO, then we would end up being directly involved
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.760]   in this war, or at least that's the risk. And so Biden's
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.560]   position is that the Alliance will admit Ukraine at some point
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.240]   in the future when the conditions have been met. And
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.360]   that wasn't good enough for Zelensky. And he basically
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.040]   threw a diplomatic tantrum. Why? Well, I mean, do you want to
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.360]   explain from his point of view? I mean,
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.200]   I'm curious what you would think his Why would he do something
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.400]   like that? Is I guess my question? Yeah,
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.720]   I think there's a couple of different reasons. Okay. So I
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.160]   think the less positive explanation is that his sense of
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.120]   entitlement has reached incredible proportions, that you
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.040]   had here the entire West, and especially the Western media has
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.320]   been fawning over him for a year, the West has given over
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.280]   $100 billion. And he just feels entitled to more and more aid.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.720]   And I think that really rubbed the attendees the wrong way. You
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.640]   had Ben Wallace, who's the Secretary of Defense for the UK,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:59.120]   basically chastise Zelensky for his ingratitude. And just so you
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:02.680]   understand, I mean, Ben Wallace is a super hawk, he is super pro
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   Ukraine. And if he had his way, we might even be directly
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.800]   involved in the fighting Biden actually vetoed Ben Wallace
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.480]   becoming the new head of NATO. That's why Stoltenberg on
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.520]   another year. So you probably got one of the most hawkish
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.840]   members of this club, reprimanding Zelensky for again,
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.520]   this lack of gratitude, basically to the Alliance. Now,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.200]   I think from Zelensky standpoint, his view is that,
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.120]   hey, we had a peace deal, he didn't say this, but this is my
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.400]   reading between the lines, that we had a peace deal at
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.800]   Istanbul, we could have ended this war. And you sent Boris
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.680]   Johnson to tell me, we don't want to make a deal, we want to
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.120]   pressure Putin. And we're going to give you the weapon systems
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   to win this war. That was the deal that he thought he was
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.400]   making. And now it turns out that the US doesn't have enough
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.600]   ammunition to give him I'm talking about the key type of
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.240]   ammunition in this war, which is artillery shells, the US has
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.320]   basically run out of 155 millimeter artillery shells,
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.480]   which are the key type of ammunition that's using these
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:09.960]   howitzers and these tanks and so forth. And artillery is the
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.120]   main weapon being used in this war. It's what's creating most
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   of the casualties. So it must have come as a rude awakening to
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.840]   Zelensky to find out that his partners don't have enough
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.440]   ammunition to give them. And I'm still stunned that we spent over
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.320]   800 billion a year on defense, and we could run out of
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:32.400]   ammunition. I mean, how does that happen? I mean, how royally
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.080]   screwed is the American taxpayer when we spend 800 billion a
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.040]   year, and we are out of ammunition already? It is mind
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.280]   boggling to me. My now the problem is mind boggling, right?
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.880]   I mean, how incompetent has our military industrial complex
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.680]   become that this could even happen?
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.880]   We need more competition startup shout out Palmer lucky friend of
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.240]   the pot. But in a way, I mean, I know he hates me. But I do think
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.880]   that the solution is 10 more Palmer luckies. I mean, I think
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:04.160]   the Silicon Valley's anti supporting the military is a
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.320]   crazy position that needs to change. And we should make more
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.760]   weapons and have VC backed companies making weapon systems
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.000]   that are more affordable and you know, more advanced, obviously,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.840]   this is actually not a case of needing some smart bomb or some
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.160]   super sophisticated tech. This is basically just basic
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.320]   industrial production. And we've hollowed out so much for our
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.600]   industrial production that we don't have the capability to
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:31.240]   scale up the manufacturing of these artillery shells is going
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.960]   to take us according to the Pentagon, they started the war
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.200]   at 14,000 shells being produced a month mainly for training
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.520]   purposes. They've scaled that to somewhere between 20 and 30,000
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.280]   a month now. And they're saying that they will get to about 90,000
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.640]   in somewhere between 2025 and 2028.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.400]   3% unemployment.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.000]   Multiple years, factories, right?
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.920]   It's gonna take multiple years to scale up these factories.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.320]   But sex was gonna work in these factories. We're at 3%
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.960]   unemployment, like, we don't have factory workers in this
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.800]   country, we have to let them in, we're gonna need more immigrants.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.360]   That's not the limiting factor here. But if you're wondering,
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:13.600]   why did the US give cluster bombs to Ukraine, it's because
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.800]   we're out of ammo to give. And it's all we've got left are
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.840]   these stockpiles of cluster munitions. That is why the
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.440]   United States is violating international law, a treaty that
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.360]   we haven't signed, but 120 other countries have signed not to use
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.240]   cluster munitions. And yet we are giving them to Ukraine
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.120]   because according to both Biden and Jake Sullivan, we are out.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.000]   You think we shouldn't give them the cluster bombs? That's your
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.200]   position? Well, I wouldn't have put ourselves in this position.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.600]   I mean, we're in a terrible position. But no, I think it's
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.840]   degrading to America's moral authority to be violating
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.080]   international law to be using and endorsing cluster munitions.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.200]   But we put ourselves in this situation.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.760]   The counter to that, of course, is Russia's using them on
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.480]   Ukraine soil. This is Ukraine soil. Don't they have the right
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.760]   to defend themselves and use the same weapons that the invader is
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.680]   using? That's disputed. It's known. Yeah, it is. If the
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   Russians were using them, would you think it would be fair for
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.080]   the Ukraine? Since they're being invaded?
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.320]   The thing that I find curious about these accusations is that
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.520]   when people talk about these examples of the Russians using
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.160]   cluster munitions, they talk about an example here or an
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.440]   example there. There are these isolated cases, which doesn't
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.440]   sound right to me, it seems to me that if you're going to use
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.240]   cluster munitions, why wouldn't you just use them at scale? That
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.480]   is what the Ukrainians are going to be doing now. Because again,
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.520]   it's all we've got left to give them now what the Russians have
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.600]   said is that in retaliation, they're going to start using
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:41.360]   cluster munitions at scale. So regardless of the truth of those
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.240]   allegations, Jason, yeah, it's an escalating this war. Yes.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.120]   And the reason why did Ukraine so just a reason why 120 120
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.760]   countries signed an agreement not to use cluster munitions is
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:58.240]   because they linger. Yeah, it's terrible on the battlefield long
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.520]   after and you have kids walking on them and civilians, we're
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.800]   still cleaning them up in many locations around the world that
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.680]   they should be banned forever. Yeah, I agree. Let me give get
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:08.920]   your take on this sacks. As we wrap up here on the sacks red
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.600]   meat section and then go to science corner. Putin did what
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.680]   NATO couldn't do for decades, which is get Finland and Sweden
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.360]   who are famously independent, like a lot of the Nordics to
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.320]   join NATO. They both joined because of his invasion of
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.120]   Ukraine. And he's been very serious that if Finland were to
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:32.920]   join or if Sweden were to join, that this would be a trigger for
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.640]   him. If military contingents and military infrastructure were
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.680]   deployed there, we would be obliged to respond symmetrically
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.840]   and raise the same threats to those territories where threats
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.880]   have arisen for us. He's done nothing. Do you think that
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.240]   Sweden and Finland are a huge L for him? And do you think he'll
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.040]   have any kind of response to it? Do you think they should have
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.000]   been allowed in to NATO?
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.600]   I think it's an L for everybody. I mean, we used to
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.720]   have an understanding that we'd have a buffer zone between
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.120]   Russia and the West. And that was good for everybody. Finland
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:08.000]   was neutral. And I think it was good for Finland. I mean, during
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.880]   the entire Cold War, they were at much greater risk facing the
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.080]   Soviet Union on their border, which was a much more powerful
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:18.920]   and much more expansionist country than Putin's Russia has
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.760]   been. Even if you don't like Putin's Russia, the Soviet Union
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.840]   was the evil empire was much worse in every dimension. And
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.120]   Finland managed to survive the Cold War, remaining neutral. And
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.240]   so now you're right that I think this invasion of Ukraine has
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.600]   ultimately caused Finland and Sweden to join NATO. But we are
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.720]   now directly NATO is going to be directly on their border staring
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.320]   eyeball to eyeball with nuclear weapons. The Russians have now
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.760]   moved nuclear weapons into Belarus. So this is a ratcheting
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.040]   up of tensions that I think is not good for anybody
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.240]   who should get to decide Friedberg who joins NATO, NATO,
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.440]   the countries I want to join or Russia?
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.760]   What do you mean? NATO?
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.360]   It's a pretty basic question. You know, right now it's Russia
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:10.320]   saying Ukraine cannot join NATO. It's a line in the sand.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.120]   Obviously, Finland and Sweden just joined this year. So I'm
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.480]   curious your take on the NATO Alliance and if it's good for
[01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.600]   humanity.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.600]   I think look, obviously, this is a this is a different difficult
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.200]   calculus. If you that's why I'm asking the question is NATO wants
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:31.880]   to escalate tensions with Russia by accepting Ukraine, it's
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.480]   obviously going to require a significant influx of capital by
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.440]   some estimates up to $2 trillion to increase the security
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:44.800]   capacity of NATO. Given the instigation that would arise
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.880]   from accepting Ukraine into NATO with Russia. So that is one
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.280]   path. The other path is to not accept Ukraine into NATO and
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.920]   minimize the investment needed. Reduce the escalatory cycle with
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.600]   Russia to some degree for some period of time, see where things
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.480]   go with Ukraine and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.240]   Well said but not get actively involved. So it's a difficult
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:11.360]   calculus. I think everyone wants to jump to some decision about
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.800]   what should be done here. But this is a very hard decision.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:14.200]   Very hard.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.080]   What do you think about Finland and Sweden joining? Is it a is
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.120]   it a major win for NATO in the West? Is it a major L for
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.560]   Russia somewhere in between? I don't really know. Yeah. I think
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.400]   that's as honest as you can get. Yeah.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.960]   Like I said, I think it's just sort of bad for everybody. But
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.720]   in the United States, among the foreign policy establishment,
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.640]   they tend to think that any country joining NATO is an asset
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.360]   for us. And I would argue that it's a liability because it
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:44.360]   requires the US to defend these countries. Again, if Sweden or
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.520]   Finland gets in a war, we are making a guarantee to send
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.400]   American boys and girls to go defend that country. Now, they
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.760]   also make a guarantee to defend us. But realistically, are we
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.640]   going to benefit does our security benefit by having
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.200]   Sweden or Finland? We don't know who's going to defend us? No. So
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.880]   every time you add a country to NATO, you're making a
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.360]   commitment for Americans to have to go defend that country. And I
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.400]   would argue that's a liability, not an asset for America. Now,
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.800]   you know, it's an asset for is a military industrial complex,
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.760]   because all these countries when they join NATO, agree to spend
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:26.320]   2% of their GDP on defense. And they can only spend that money
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.120]   on defense contractors who are interoperable with the NATO
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.800]   platform, which is basically these approved Western
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.360]   contractors. What is the defense industry loves NATO expansion,
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.440]   the military, they're locked into vendor lock. Absolutely. Oh, I
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.120]   didn't know there was vendor lock. And that's like when you
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.560]   rent like, you know, a union hotel or something, they're
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.840]   like, you got to use Wolfgang Puck, and it's $800 a person for
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.880]   coffee, one of the requirements for a country to join NATO, and
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:56.560]   Ukraine already had been on this path for the last few years is
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.640]   called interoperability. You have to make your military
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:03.840]   interoperable with NATO, which means that you use weapons as
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.400]   well as tactics and strategies, but weapons that are on the
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.400]   approved NATO list. And if you looked at the summit, we just
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.440]   had in Vilnius, when all the planes came into the airport,
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:19.120]   you had these anti aircraft batteries and howitzers and all
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.960]   these tanks, all these weapons were being shown off by our
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.800]   defense contractors at the NATO summit, it was like a confab for
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.160]   the MIC. All right, you have to understand that NATO is a
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.200]   business. And the more countries that join NATO, the more money
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.040]   our defense contractors make. Yeah. And but the less price of
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:43.280]   that for the average American is that our sons and daughters, one
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.400]   day might have to go defend these countries. And it reduces
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.960]   the risk of Russia going into another country would be the
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.040]   other steel man of it. But let's go on to science corner. Every
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.840]   fair, everybody's favorite part of the show is science corner.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.760]   sacks, you can go use the bathroom and Chamath and I will
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.120]   be absolutely engaged in freebergs science corner. Let's
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.400]   go. We were talking about what to talk about. As you guys know,
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.800]   I said, Hey, we could talk about the sea surface temperatures in
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.920]   the Atlantic, that's likely going to drive the biggest
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.840]   hurricane season we've ever seen this coming season. super
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.880]   compelling, good topic, we were going to talk about this minimal
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.520]   cell. But then just yesterday, this paper was published, which
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.760]   I think deserves a lot of attention. And we've talked
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.960]   about Yamanaka factors, and reprogramming cells, you know,
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.760]   adjusting the epigenetics of a cell to make it youthful,
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.480]   basically reversing aging. And, you know, a couple episodes ago,
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.720]   I talked about how there's great proof and evidence now, that
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.440]   aging is a result of degradation or changes in the epigenome, the
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.760]   little molecules that stick on top of the DNA in a cell that
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.640]   decide what proteins are expressed that make that cell
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.480]   different from all the other cells, the difference between an
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.880]   eye cell, and a muscle cell in the skin cell is the epigenetics
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.080]   of that cell, even though they all have the same DNA in the
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.200]   nucleus. And so the Yamanaka factors, these four chemicals
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.360]   that allowed the expression of these four specific genes, cause
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.560]   cells to become stem cells that can turn into any other cell,
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.520]   the problem with applying Yamanaka factors to reverse
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.520]   aging, is that it turns the cells into cancer cells if you
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.960]   apply too much. So then there were all these efforts on doing
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:25.240]   short bursts of Yamanaka factors. And more recently,
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.720]   there's been an effort to do gene insertions through viral
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.840]   vectors, you basically get a virus to deliver a gene into a
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.360]   cell that causes that cell to express some of the Yamanaka
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.760]   factors that makes that cell more youthful. And there's
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.560]   actually clinical trials underway right now, to apply
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.200]   this as a medicine for for vision loss, where you can make
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.120]   the the retinal cells actually youthful. Yeah, really
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.640]   incredible. So the problem right now is that we don't really know
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.920]   how to target the cells how to provide the right amount of
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.480]   Yamanaka factor stuff. And how to get it there is that these
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:02.280]   gene expressing viruses or what do we do, but this paper that
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.160]   was just published yesterday shows that you can use small
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.320]   molecules, basically small molecules are like Advil, or
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.880]   Tylenol, or you know, there's about 1800 molecules in a
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.240]   certain reference library that's used in medicine. And what this
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:21.320]   research team at Harvard Medical, and some other
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.080]   facilities, MIT and other places in collaboration, we're able to
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.720]   do is they basically did a screen, a combinatorial screen.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.760]   So they took all these different molecules that are known to be
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.160]   used in medicine, and they combine them together and
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:38.560]   created different cocktails. They then took those cocktails,
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.080]   and they apply them to the cells to see if they could reverse
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.760]   aging. And in fact, they found six different cocktails of small
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.920]   molecules that were able to have the same effect as we see with
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.080]   the Yamanaka factors in short bursts to cause these cells to
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.440]   actually reverse their aging and become youthful. Again, I cannot
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.360]   overstate how important this is, this is probably the most
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.880]   important trajectory of what's underway in biology since the
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.440]   discovery of DNA, this ability to actually make cells youthful
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.920]   again, it can in fact, ultimately result in a pill or a
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.120]   series of pills that can reverse aging. That is why it is so
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.920]   exciting right now. And we're seeing this data coming out from
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:20.520]   this research team. And I have heard separately about data that
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.080]   has not yet been published by other research teams following
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.880]   the same track to do the same thing that it turns out, it may
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.520]   in fact be possible to create pills with small molecules in it
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.880]   things that your body can absorb and end up in your bloodstream
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.280]   and go into different cells that actually rejuvenate the
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.480]   cells, fix the epigenetic data loss that happens in those
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:43.160]   cells causes them to become more youthful, you could see a cream
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.760]   that you can apply to your skin that takes away wrinkles.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.920]   Ultimately, you could take something that makes your heart
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.480]   healthier, your liver healthier, and actually reverses aging in
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.000]   the individual cells by the absorption of these small
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.200]   molecules into those cells that ultimately cause the expression
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.680]   of these genes and change all the transcriptome as it's called
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.800]   in the cell and makes it more youthful. It is unbelievable
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:07.480]   work. Everyone should be, I think, fascinated by this. And
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.120]   where it's headed. It is so exciting that there are multiple
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.240]   teams that are having breakthroughs on this work that
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.560]   could ultimately translate into clinical trials and products
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.680]   that could be used by the obvious question, can we get
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:22.600]   this to Biden before the debates? Oh, hey, Chamath your
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.920]   your Uranus joke, please. Come on. Sorry, I didn't mean to step
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:29.400]   on your range. I'm so tired. I had such a big night last night.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.160]   Man, he's like, I can't even get a Uranus joke up. I drank so
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:41.720]   much wine. I am fucking gassed today. When you drank so much
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.520]   wine. How many bottles were opened? And how many glasses
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.840]   did you have? Be honest, I'm gonna put the over under at six
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.040]   glasses. There was six 5.5 glasses. There was six of us.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:57.040]   It's probably seven or eight bottles. But it's just like, it
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.320]   was just so delicious. And then I don't like to eat a lot when
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.480]   I'm drinking really, really good wine. And then Oh, man, wow.
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:08.120]   I'm tired. Okay, that's all right. 5.5 you got the over the
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.760]   under sacks. 5.5 glasses. I got the I drank so much. I had the
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.120]   night sweats. I woke up. I was like, Oh, nothing. I get the
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.320]   night sweats. I need too much. You were drinking red wine. You
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.960]   were not drinking white wine. No, no, no white. No white white
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:25.640]   the whole night. Yeah. Champagne. Champagne. Champagne.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.920]   I'll get you that champagne catcher. What is the worst
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.480]   hangover? Is it red wine, champagne or white? I'll get
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.840]   you what it's like the sweeter it is the higher the alcohol
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.640]   content, the more it really just fucks with me personally.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.360]   Sank producer Nick coming in hot $7 pitches are sangria all
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.760]   night. He says sangria. That's because they pour sugar in a
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:48.840]   dude. sangria the more sugar it's just it's just it's just a
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.480]   sugar bomb. It's terrible. You know what I'm gonna I'm gonna be
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.560]   in Italy. So maybe we could catch up and have dinner.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.440]   Chamatha I don't know where you'll be about shortly. I will
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.880]   look you up when I'm in Italy. Maybe I don't know if anybody
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.920]   the best years are going to be in Italy anytime over the summer
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.280]   but I may go to Italy taping next week or no. Oh my god. Can
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.960]   we do it live in Italy? I'll be in Italy next week actually.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.360]   What are we doing next week? Are we taping next week or no? I
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.320]   don't know if I say we're not taping then freeberg's going
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:18.120]   broke. So I'll say keeps up to you Friedberg since apparently
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.640]   you know how to hack the fucking YouTube channel. Well, you took
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.880]   the passwords back. Of course I did. I need to have two factor
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.440]   when you hacked it. I was like, who is trying to log in and then
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.920]   I was like,
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.760]   Yeah, I'm gonna get your phone next time.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.720]   Yeah, well, you're in the bathroom. I'm gonna run into
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.120]   your house and take your phone. Thanks. Thanks. That's you
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.320]   running into my house. Well, I will say I'll tell you my honest
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.960]   opinion. I missed you last week. I think that the show is better
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.400]   with you. I think that you bring a character and a personality
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.360]   that I miss when you're not around. And as much as we fight
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.640]   like brothers that truly hate each other. I really do. respect
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.280]   and appreciate what you do on the show. And I honestly felt it
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.520]   was a big hole last week. So despite all of our issues, I
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.560]   think it's great to be doing the show with you. I want to let you
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.280]   know that. Thank you. That's very, very heartfelt and kind.

[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.480]   Chouchi PT.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.480]   How do I make J Cal feel better?
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.080]   Do I express emotion to a friend? How do I behave like a
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.720]   loyal friend? Yeah, the YouTube channel and publish a rogue
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:28.960]   episode? No, that's not how you do it. All right, listen, for
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:34.800]   the drunken hungover dictator. C3P Friedberg, the Sultan of
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:37.920]   science, the prince of panic attacks the Queen of keen. Wah.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:45.120]   And crazy hair don't care. The architect, Steve Bannon with a
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.800]   high IQ. His name is David Sacks. I am the world's
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:53.280]   obviously greatest moderator after the shit show last week.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.960]   And this has been best episode of any podcast ever recorded. And
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:03.520]   we'll see you all next week. Maybe we'll grab some pasta.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.840]   Love you besties. Love you guys.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.880]   Let your winners ride.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.720]   Rain Man David Sacks.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:19.160]   We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.160]   Love you.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.960]   Besties Queen of keen. Wah.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:29.840]   Besties are gone.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.360]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:41.760]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.600]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.880]   sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:53.360]   Wet your the beak. Wet your beak. We need to get merch.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:03.600]   I'm going all in. I'm going all in.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:05.660]   you
