[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   I have been to about 130 countries and I do not want to be accused as a country counter
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.300]   because I've been to Iceland 37 times.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.960]   I have three trips to the Tahiti plan this year.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.960]   I like to go back to a lot of places that I know and I like to dig even deeper.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.680]   I do try to find opportunities to visit somewhere new, but I want it to be organic.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.040]   I don't want to go somewhere and not have a plan or a point of view or an idea for a
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.040]   story.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   I like to go everywhere with a mission and I think that's a really good piece of information
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.320]   for solo travelers.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   Find a mission for your trip so you don't feel lost.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.600]   My mission tends to be finding information and personalities for an article.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.560]   When things start to bake in those places, I prioritize that new place.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.480]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.680]   money, and travel.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.040]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I am excited to have you here today because I'm talking with one
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.440]   of the most well-traveled people I've ever met, Brandon Presser.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.480]   He's an award-winning travel journalist who's been to 130 countries.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.720]   He's written over 50 guidebooks.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.100]   He regularly contributes to CondÃ© Nast Traveler in Bloomberg and hosted the Bravo television
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.960]   series Tour Group.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.160]   But most recently, he released his latest book, The Far Land, and it is a crazy true
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.240]   story about 200 years of murder, mania, and mutiny in the South Pacific.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.560]   It's definitely worth a read.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.420]   In our conversation, I'm going to try my best to pull out all the travel tips and hacks
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420]   I can.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.220]   We'll talk about planning a trip, where to stay, having authentic experiences, how best
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.580]   to use reviews and guidebooks, why the type of Q-tip a hotel has matters, and we'll get
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.380]   his take on the best places you can go for your next trip, including a few unexpected
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.380]   ones.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.100]   I don't know how we're going to get into all of this in the amount of time we have, but
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.660]   I'm going to try hard.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.660]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.420]   Brandon, thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.980]   Thanks so much for having me.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.580]   Yeah, I am really excited for this conversation.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.140]   I want to jump right in and just ask, what do you think most people get wrong about the
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.540]   way they travel?
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.420]   Man, good question.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.420]   Okay.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.180]   Over the last 10 years, as we've seen social media really ramp up and we see that everyone
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.620]   can post all their experiences and find experiences to cover it on Instagram, travel has become
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620]   a bit of a performance for a lot of people.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.940]   Look at me in this place.
[00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.700]   And I think that's the biggest pitfall that people make.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.060]   Because if you're seeing travel as a commodity or as you performing in that space, you're
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.740]   not actually engaging in that destination.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.020]   And so if someone were thinking about how to spend an upcoming trip, they were like,
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.020]   "You know what?
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.500]   I'm going to take a week off in the fall."
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   What would you tell them to start doing even before they know where they're going to have
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.460]   the right kind of trip?
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.180]   I think the biggest mistake that people make, but when they're about to travel is they pick
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.140]   a place and not a reason.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.980]   So I would start your trip planning by thinking about what you want to get out of that trip
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.060]   and then find a shortlist of destinations and marry that shortlist to the purpose of
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.420]   your travel.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.420]   So "I want to go to Italy" might end up being a hollow experience because the thing that
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.540]   you actually want to get out of the trip is going to a place where there's not a lot of
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.940]   other tourists or going to a place where you really want to have an experience where you're
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.620]   meeting people, making new friendships.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.180]   Italy is America's favorite destination in Europe.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.140]   That might not happen for you in a one-week trip there.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.140]   And if it would, it probably might not happen in the place that you might by default go.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.060]   You're like, "I'm going to go to Rome and meet people."
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.020]   That might not be the easiest spot to blend in.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.020]   Exactly.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.580]   And you know, there's nothing wrong with having your bucket list and hearing about a trip
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.900]   that someone else took and wanting to go there too.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.100]   Word of mouth is the most powerful tool in travel.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.740]   But if you're just sitting down to say, "I have a week in September and I want to fill
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.660]   it," start with how you want to fill it, not where.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.700]   And do you have some examples of things to inspire people about how they could fill it?
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.860]   Let's start with something like, is it a trip where you want to expend a lot of energy?
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.500]   Do you want it to be a really active trip?
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.940]   Do you want it to be physically active, socially active?
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.120]   Or are you on super burnout and you need a place where you don't want to talk to other
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.460]   people and you just want to be on a beach, in a cabin, on a mountain, in the desert?
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.920]   Think about that first.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.740]   Is this going to be like a big social and physical spend or is this like a reboot?
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.940]   And a trip can be both too.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.660]   Just put the big spend first and put the reboot second, so that you come home fresh.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.300]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   Why do you love travel?
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.540]   I mean, you've done a ton of traveling, you haven't hit the whole world, but you're closer
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   than most.
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.780]   I'm working my way through.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   Why do I love travel?
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:32.500]   Well, I was the kid, the 5-year-old kid that would ask my parents for a trip when they
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.020]   were like, "What do you want for your birthday?"
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.860]   I didn't want a toy, I wanted a trip.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.900]   And I was a kid who had no attention for reading.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.340]   All I wanted to do was look at atlases.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.660]   And I think I've had this very ADD brain for years that finds something super interesting,
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.820]   jumps on it, learns everything there is to know about that thing, and then jumps to the
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.860]   next thing.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:03.220]   And travel has been the only industry in space that has allowed me to let my ADD free.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.860]   I am obsessed with learning.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.400]   I'm obsessed with learning things about different cultures.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.660]   I think through travel, you ultimately learn a lot more about yourself.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.700]   And so for me, it's about seeing the world in an ordinary way.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.980]   I want to go to places and see what the everyday life is for someone there.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.300]   I don't need to check off the Taj Mahal or the Sydney Opera House off of a list.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.140]   I just want to see how other people are experiencing the world, how other people's minds work,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.020]   what motivates people, what are people's hopes and dreams, and what do we have in common,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.660]   and what are our differences?
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.180]   So that seems like a great goal.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.340]   And I feel like the more you travel in general, the more you're able to appreciate that.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.140]   How would you go about making a meaningful itinerary for a trip?
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:03.340]   Well, I think we've come so far away from checklist travel, especially in the American
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.340]   media.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.120]   It's like, "Oh, don't go to the Louvre.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.500]   Don't go to the Taj Mahal."
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.700]   It's okay if you want to see them.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.440]   Go see them and have a look if that's part of your motivation.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.680]   But I think what you need to be thinking about as well is that it's okay not to have everything
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.460]   figured out and not have everything structured.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.740]   I've talked to people who've not been to destinations that they're about to go to, and they're really
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.580]   excited for the trip because at 8am, they're doing this and at 9am, they're doing that.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.580]   10, they have this planned.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.980]   11, they have this planned.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.100]   And it's this whole list of checklist travel in a different way.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.580]   We think of checklist travel as going to see the big ticket, but then people are like,
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.260]   "Well, I have my food experience and I have my museum experience and I have it all lined
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.260]   up."
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.780]   So, the best thing about travel and the thing that you will talk about to your friends when
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.980]   you get back, I guarantee is not on that list before you travel.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.740]   It's the moment of serendipity where you're at a restaurant and you hit it off with the
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.340]   waiter and you all go somewhere after and you're in this cool place that you never thought
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.500]   you would be meeting people that you never thought you would meet and you connect on
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.460]   Instagram afterwards and you stay in touch.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.700]   You need to let your trip breathe.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.380]   Because if you're too planned out, you're not actually piercing the veneer, the tourism
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.380]   veneer.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.220]   Are there any great examples from your many travels of letting that happen and what unfolded?
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.500]   I was on a trip.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.540]   I was on a surf trip in Northern Norway.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.220]   And it was a great experience because I got to meet a lot of other people.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.700]   I was traveling by myself and we were all doing the surf camp together.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.780]   So it was instant friends.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.780]   And then I tacked on a few days in Oslo at the end, just on my own, snooping around.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.860]   And I went to this restaurant, I was just eating by myself and I was looking over to
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.140]   these people my age that were sitting next to me.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.980]   And I just turned to them and I was like, "What are you guys up to?"
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.940]   And they just seemed like a group of fun friends and they're like, "Oh, we're going to sing
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.020]   karaoke after this."
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.740]   And we ended up staying out all night.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.780]   I had a 7am flight the next morning and they were like, "Go get your stuff.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.780]   Just leave it in my apartment.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.780]   We're going to go out all night."
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.700]   And we sang karaoke.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.660]   We went to these bars that didn't even know existed that were open all night long after
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.660]   after parties.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.860]   It doesn't always have to be a party either.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.420]   But it was just such an unexpected experience where I thought I had my built-in friends
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.740]   in Northern Norway for the surf camp, but yet the people that I stay in touch with are
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.540]   actually these random people I met in a Vietnamese restaurant in Oslo.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:49.980]   And do you think there's something aside from just leaving space in the itinerary or leaving
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:56.140]   time open that you can do to help make sure experiences like that have a higher chance
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]   of happening?
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.740]   I think solo travel, you have a lot of energy pointed outwards.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.740]   You're curious.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.740]   You're by yourself.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.660]   You're open to having someone come up to you and talk to you.
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.820]   If you're by yourself on the street, that's usually when someone's like, "Hey, I need
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.820]   help with directions to this."
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.580]   Keeping that energy open, I know it sounds a little bit hooey, but that's part of it.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.860]   Also, I think because we live so much on our phones, it's really jarring to actually go
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.700]   up and talk to someone.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.500]   But it's become jarring in a good way at this point where people are like, "Oh, you want
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.780]   to ask me a question?
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.300]   Let's strike up a conversation."
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.380]   I think one of the things that I'm always thinking about is generosity.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.380]   When you go to a destination, you come back with stories where you're like, "Oh, this
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.380]   family.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.460]   I met them and they invited me into their house."
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:55.780]   You can get these Airbnb experiences of going into people's homes and cooking with them
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.220]   or learning tango or whatever it is.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.900]   I think if we think about it in the opposite way, how can we be generous to the people
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.180]   that we're visiting?
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.940]   I think that you also garner a lot of goodwill in that regard as well.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.940]   Can you give me an example of being generous while visiting?
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940]   Sure.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:20.540]   I always pack little gifts for people that I've not yet met.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.660]   So it's like a little something from home, like a candy.
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:30.220]   We all have this sentimental feeling about the candy that we grew up with.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.180]   I grew up in Canada and there's candy in Canada that you can't get in the US.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.740]   Candy from where you're from is a really fun thing to exchange with people because it's
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.580]   oddly personal.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.740]   Stuff from where you live, even like a cool postcard.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.620]   I often bring little blank business cards with me.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.660]   If I meet someone really cool, I'll write them a note and leave my email address.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.940]   You can control the message that way.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:04.060]   You can leave them a phone number for WhatsApp if you want to hear from them a lot or Instagram
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.940]   if you want to hear from the West.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:13.900]   Doing things analog, it shocks the system and it starts inspiring devotion.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:20.180]   I think back to a trip I took to Syria where almost everyone seemed to want to invite you
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.420]   into their home.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:28.100]   I will say my wife and I were traveling together and so it's not just a solo traveler thing.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.660]   Sometimes people can be a little put at ease by having two people.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.100]   They're like, "Oh, this isn't a random dude on the street.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   It's a couple.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   They're probably a little bit...
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.340]   I can trust them and invite them over."
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.980]   And we had all kinds of experiences.
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.120]   For some reason, when I was like, "Oh, I guess if I'm paying to go to someone's house, does
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.140]   it feel less authentic?
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.740]   Is it the commercialized version of it?"
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.100]   How do you think about trying to make those experiences happen naturally versus maybe
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.860]   saving the time and buying the serendipity?
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.980]   Yeah, that's the Catch-22, right?
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:11.060]   I've had guides that I've hired to do mountain climbing or to visit a city and I have struck
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.220]   up genuine friendships with those guides.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.820]   So I suppose it's not that different than hiring someone.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.180]   Hiring someone is essentially what it is to be invited into their house and to cook with
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.540]   them or to learn something from them.
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.780]   It's an opportunity to connect with someone.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.340]   It's just a shame that it has to be so transactional.
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:44.300]   I don't think that there's necessarily a way to have magic happen or have serendipity happen
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.140]   if you're trying too hard.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:51.380]   One of the things that I'll try to do that feels like a little bit more unscripted is
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:57.180]   maybe try to find a run club in a city that I'm going to.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.020]   And usually, those are free.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.220]   Usually they're on weekends.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.060]   And that's always a good opportunity because at least you have something in common from
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.060]   the start.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.620]   You both like to run.
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.420]   And then often, you need to refuel after your run.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:18.140]   So maybe there's an invite with the person/people that you're with to go for brunch after an
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.140]   early morning run.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.140]   I would start there.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:27.180]   I would start with something that feels true to you, a passion point of yours, and bridge
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.500]   a more organic relationship with someone because you share something that you like.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.420]   We were in Sweden.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.700]   And evidently, there's a lot of gamers in Sweden.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.020]   And we walked by a store that had every board game.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.900]   And I couldn't help but think, "My wife and I love board games."
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900]   We didn't actually have time that day.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:51.140]   But your example of a run club could be going to some board game night at a board game store
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.140]   or whatever your hobby is.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:59.140]   I bet there is a group of people that partake in that hobby in most major cities.
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.420]   So if you're listening and you don't love running, I'm sure there is another group that
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   you can find of people that might become people to hang out with.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.260]   It doesn't have to be exercise.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.500]   It doesn't have to be running.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:21.060]   A past version of me used to take different journalists as a fixer, producers, journalists
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.820]   to different countries to show them a few cool things.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.980]   Maybe they wanted to use this as a filming location or they wanted to scout a photo shoot.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.860]   And I took an editor from Vanity Fair once to Iceland.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.460]   And I did just that, except it wasn't running.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.340]   It was knitting.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.700]   And we found a knitting bee.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.060]   And we just hung out with these women knitting for a whole afternoon.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.900]   We ended up baking cakes with them.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.900]   That kind of thing.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.980]   Find that point in common and start from there.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.540]   I like that.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.500]   Talk a little bit more about being a fixer in Iceland.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.980]   What is that experience like and how would someone who doesn't know anything about a
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:10.340]   country find the person like you in that country to hire to help show them the ins and outs
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.140]   that is probably...
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.420]   I'm guessing you didn't just have a website where you're like, "I'm the Iceland fixer
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   guy.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   Come hire me."
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.420]   No.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.220]   All that happened word of mouth.
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:29.880]   But I worked at Lonely Planet for about 7 full years, doing back-to-back guidebooks
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.880]   for them.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.700]   And the cool thing about Lonely Planet is essentially, you just get paid to marinate
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.780]   in a destination for a very extended amount of time.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.420]   And every day, you're going out looking for something new and cool.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:50.820]   And through that, I built a portfolio of destinations where I could consider myself a real expert.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.780]   I think everyone's probably stayed at a Marriott.
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.940]   And when you go stay at just a standard Marriott...
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.920]   Look, Marriott as a brand has lots of different hotels.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.800]   But just like the standard Marriott, it's hard to not know exactly what you're getting.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.600]   So I could imagine someone being like, "Well, this is 10 stars because I thought it was
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.060]   exactly what I wanted and it met the needs, but it certainly wasn't pushing the boundaries
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.080]   on anything by any stretch."
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.200]   How do you know if you're planning in advance and trying to pick between 5 hotels?
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.080]   You've agreed that the stars don't make sense.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.580]   But if you needed to go pick...
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.880]   You had all the data, but couldn't go to the country.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.120]   How would you try to figure out where to stay?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.960]   How would you try to sort through the information that exists to you, knowing that it's imperfect?
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.240]   Well, I always say, in learning about other places, you learn a lot about yourself.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.320]   And I think part of that is honing your instinct.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.200]   A lot of travel requires street smarts.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.120]   Marriott requires a lot of big decisions in real time.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.160]   Where am I going to stay tonight?
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.760]   Am I getting on this train to go to Bucharest?
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.120]   What am I doing?
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:10.600]   And I think that trusting your gut when you're reading about places or when you're looking
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.400]   at photos is really important.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.960]   And I know that's a bit of a cop-out answer, but you're going to get a vibe when you start
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.480]   looking at photos online, when you're reading different things about different properties
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480]   online.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.200]   I would try to find those honest photos.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.720]   I would use the TripAdvisor to click the user photos because they're not polished.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.200]   You can get a real sense of the room.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:42.040]   I would not be allergic to calling a hotel and/or emailing with a hotel.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:50.080]   I think a lot of people think that your hotel experience starts the minute you check in.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.200]   That is not true.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:56.760]   If you are booking a hotel, your hotel experience starts the minute you booked it.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.800]   All of these hotels have concierge services at a certain price point, or at least they
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.560]   have a friendly person to check in.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:12.280]   And if you don't want that experience, you can book a home or an apartment rental.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:17.640]   If you're booking a human to have with your hotel experience, use them.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.840]   People never use the concierges at hotels, or people think that they can only use it
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.840]   on Saturday afternoon when they're in their hotel because they're looking for a place
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.880]   to eat Saturday or Friday night or 6 hours before they think they need it.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.680]   Use email your hotel.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.600]   Email the concierge at the hotel that you're going to stay at a month before you're going
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:45.800]   to stay there and say, "I am really interested in finding a run club, a knitting club.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.360]   I'm really interested in knowing more about your rooms.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.160]   I really am a light sleeper, and I'm a little worried about city noise.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.760]   What are some of the room numbers you recommend so that I won't be woken up in the middle
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   of the night?"
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.560]   It is their job to provide you that service before you've even arrived.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.760]   It's definitely something I think most people don't think about.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.200]   The best hotels I've stayed at have emailed me in advance and said, "Hey, we have a person
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   here.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   If you have questions, ask."
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.240]   I'll share a couple of the ones I like.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.960]   I don't necessarily have any faith that TripAdvisor stars are good, but I think their review content
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   is.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.800]   So I'll often go and be like, "Oh."
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.560]   In a lot of countries, some hotels have sunscreen just free at the pool and some don't.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.440]   So you could go to TripAdvisor and search "sunscreen" in the reviews.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.160]   One thing I sometimes do is you could just go to Instagram and search for a hotel and
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.200]   just look at what people are posting in the hotel.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.160]   People post some weird stuff.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.740]   I've definitely seen the weird people that like to post photos almost naked in their
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.440]   bathroom on Instagram.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   But there's also people that post the vibe of the hotel on a Friday night in the lobby,
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.960]   which is probably not something you might see in a TripAdvisor photo.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.560]   So that's another one.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.000]   I've probably done this once.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I think there was...
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.920]   I can't remember where, but there was a place I was going and I just didn't know how to
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.400]   answer the question.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.200]   And I think it was maybe about like, "Is the Wi-Fi reliable?
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.320]   Is it fast enough to do some work meetings or something?"
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.000]   And I just found people that were there that looked like they would be able to answer the
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.240]   question and I just DM'ed them on Instagram and asked them a question.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.920]   I was like, "You're here right now.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   Is the Wi-Fi reliable?"
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.920]   And they're like, "Yeah.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   It's super fast."
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   I was like, "Cool."
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.560]   So I think social media gives us that channel as well.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:39.200]   Any other hacks you have for getting knowledge from what I'll call "mediumly reliable sources"
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.600]   about a trip?
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.120]   So one of the big things for me is I'll go on Google Maps or I'll go on Google Earth.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.520]   And I think a lot of people, their eye goes to the stars and the reviews on Google Maps
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.720]   about a hotel.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.160]   What I'm looking at is I'm going to zoom out and I want to see the businesses that are
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.020]   next door.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.320]   So I want to know if it's a city hotel, I want to know what's in the neighborhood.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.640]   If it's a resort on a beach, this is when it's super important.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.920]   How close is that resort to the airport?
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.840]   For good and bad reasons, you're going to have to take a transfer.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.040]   But also, do you want your relaxing beach resort to have a plane going over your head
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.920]   every 5 minutes?
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   I want to see if there's a pet hospital next to your resort and you're going to be listening
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   to barking dogs all night or things like that.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.360]   When I used to teach travel writing, Lonely Planet opened a deli office.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.880]   I think this is back in 2012.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:43.120]   And they reverse outsourced me to deli to teach upcoming Indian writers how to do a
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.440]   Lonely Planet guidebook before the Indian market.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.240]   And I had days of training with them where I'd put up a slide of a hotel room and I'd
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.760]   have everyone write a review.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.160]   And of course, this was a trap because they would just say like, "Oh, the sheets are red
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.840]   and the wallpaper is nice and this looks like this."
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.320]   I'm like, "Okay, first mistake, 5 senses.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.440]   Your review needs to have all 5 senses.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.440]   What are you hearing?
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   What are you tasting?
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   What does it look like?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   What are the smells?"
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:19.960]   And I think you need to apply that to your hotel choosing, too.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.600]   So one of the ways to see is what's around the hotel, you're going to get a sense of
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600]   noise.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.020]   People are really precious about noise.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.400]   This could be a huge deal breaker at a hotel.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.560]   So I want you to think critically about that, also.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   I like that.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.400]   How do you determine what is nice if we've agreed stars and ratings and all those things
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.400]   don't matter?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:50.440]   So I have stayed at about 3,000 hotels, which is a bit crazy to think about.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   And I used to joke...
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.320]   Almost 10 years.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.560]   Just one night each, it's almost 10 years.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:02.120]   For Lonely Planet, I was staying in a different hotel every night.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.820]   And we used to get a lot of questions at Lonely Planet.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.920]   How can you tell if a hotel is good if you're only there for a night or this, that, and
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   the other?
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.720]   And I would joke that it only takes 18 minutes to suss out a hotel.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.120]   And the things that you're looking for are design and service.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.220]   And they have to come together.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.480]   So you can build a beautiful hotel that has great design.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.960]   But if you can't staff it with individuals, it's going to be a bad stay.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.360]   And vice versa, you can have a hotel that's completely falling apart, that's uncomfortable
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.780]   to stay in, and you can have friendly people, and it's still going to be a mess.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:46.680]   So it's like storytelling, you need a good story and you need to tell it well.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.080]   Otherwise, it's not working for you.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.680]   So the first thing is you want to check those two boxes.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.860]   And design doesn't necessarily mean that it looks good on Instagram.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:04.380]   A lot of hotel rooms are designed without ever someone staying in them.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:11.040]   The cord to plug in your phone, it's too far the plug from the bed so you can't look at
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   your phone in bed.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.720]   You can't find the lights.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.720]   There are too many lights.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.440]   It takes, you know, the room should be intuitive.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.200]   I'm looking at design in that regard first.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.000]   Second, I want my hotel room to make an impact.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.440]   It doesn't need to be hot pink.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.800]   But I want to feel like I'm on holiday.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.000]   I would like it to embody the destination a little bit.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.400]   It doesn't need to be a Disney-fied version of Italy.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   It doesn't need to look like a cheesecake factory.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.320]   I want to feel like I'm somewhere different.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.840]   And then I think I want service to be genuine.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.440]   I don't want over-polite service.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.240]   I don't want over-attentive service.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:01.560]   I think that there's a balance to when you want someone for help that they're there to
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.800]   help you and that they know the destination.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.980]   I want the hotels to be staffed by people who are knowledgeable that can enhance my
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:08.980]   experience.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.640]   Otherwise, I'm just going to go stay in an Airbnb.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.240]   I think smaller, I'm looking for cleanliness.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   Rooms generally get tired after seven years.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   You have to replace a mattress.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.600]   Mattresses are 10 years old and they expire.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.120]   I want that mattress replaced after seven.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.120]   I want to be taken care of.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.480]   I want the amenities in the room to be thought through.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.120]   And I don't want people to skimp on a crappy Q-tip.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.200]   I want a good Q-tip.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.720]   It's things like that.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.000]   Is that a metric?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.480]   Instead of 5 stars, it's like...
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.920]   We all know what a crappy Q-tip is.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.240]   Is that your...
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.600]   You should have your own sliding scale of Q-tip quality metrics.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:04.040]   For me, it's Q-tips and club sandwiches, because every hotel around the world has both.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.260]   So I want to know if that club sandwich is...
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.680]   How well it's going to be served, how well it's cooked.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.960]   I want to know how far the kitchen is based on how warm or cold it is, how fast it comes.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:23.560]   A Q-tip is the best thing in a room, because everyone knows that they like a nice sturdy
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   Q-tip.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.160]   And if it's flimsy and there's not that much cotton on it, they don't really care about
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   you at this hotel.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.640]   And that money is the bottom line.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   I like that.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.080]   Who has the best Q-tips and club sandwiches?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:43.600]   I have found, and this is maybe a little bit of French snobbery in me, but countries around
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.760]   the world that have been touched by French influence always have it figured out much
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   better.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.600]   I've eaten an incredible club sandwich in Madagascar, for example.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   And where?
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:08.880]   So in Tena, in the capital, I stayed at this guest house that had an amazing food, truly
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.360]   amazing food, and just the care and that sort of French style of hospitality where every
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.860]   detail is important.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.240]   You have that joie de vivre.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.080]   It really made it a very memorable stay.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.320]   And it was only supposed to be kind of like a layover stay.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.200]   I was in the middle of Madagascar on a trip and then had to connect to the capital to
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.240]   kind of do another portion.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.480]   And I didn't think I was going to get much out of it.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.880]   And then it just turned out to be this wonderful place.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.960]   Okay, you'll have to send us the name of this place and we'll put it in the show notes.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.400]   Any other places known for their club sandwich?
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.960]   I've had some of the best Western food in Japan.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:29:00.680]   And that is because there's this deep-seated element to Japanese culture where they scout
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:07.880]   the world for interesting things, and then they re-appropriate it and improve it.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:12.720]   And ramen is the best example of that, Chinese by origin.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:19.800]   They brought it over to Japan after World War II, it got really popular.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:27.440]   The broth, four days of pork broth, steeping, and they made it into something that was really
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   their own.
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.480]   And I think I see them doing it a lot with baked goods, French breads, different things
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.480]   like that.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.400]   You will have the best pastries of your life in Tokyo.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   There are countries that everyone talks about and are overrated, and then there's countries
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:46.320]   that everyone talks about and you should still definitely go and just keep going.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.080]   And I think Japan is the essence of a country that everyone talks about and you should still
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   keep going.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.600]   I 100% agree.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:01.680]   I think there are places around the world of incredibly wondrous places that everyone
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   already knows about.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   You should still go.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.480]   You don't have to be a contrarian, Machu Picchu.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.120]   It's incredible when the clouds lift off of it in the morning.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.680]   It is amazing.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.360]   I want you to go do it.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   Just because a lot of other people have doesn't mean you should skip it.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:24.280]   What else is on that list of places that even though everyone seems to go there, you think
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.480]   are still standout destinations?
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:33.680]   Japan is always at the top of my list when people ask me what are my favorite places.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:42.360]   I just would encourage people not to treat it totally as this otherworldly thing because
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:48.400]   then you don't have the opportunity to connect and have that meaningful experience.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.600]   Don't treat it like an alien world.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.040]   There are a lot of things that are similar but improved.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.120]   Like the club sandwich I was mentioning before.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:06.400]   The attention to detail and care is a different form of hospitality.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.960]   The way that things are presented, the aesthetics.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.520]   I once did a story for Bloomberg where I went to Kyoto and I wrote a whole story about what
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:21.480]   if you did only new things in Kyoto because everyone's hardwired to think Tokyo new, Kyoto
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   old.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:27.560]   But what if we flip the script and we did Tokyo old, Kyoto new.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:36.600]   And I found these incredible photographers, performance artists, people that were changing
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:45.640]   the way sushi is made and it was maybe one of my best four days in Japan ever by doing
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.000]   Kyoto new.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Wow.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.640]   And then Japan old, I mean Tokyo old as well?
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:58.120]   Tokyo old, you can go to the northeast part of the city.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:05.160]   It was the only area that wasn't really bombed during World War II and it didn't suffer as
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.680]   much during the Great Kanto Earthquake in the 1920s.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.280]   And all of that is really well preserved.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.400]   Rent a bicycle, go through Yanaka, that neighborhood.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:26.000]   I wrote The Lonely Planet Guide to Japan and I created a pilgrimage that people do on New
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.240]   Years but I created this that you could do at any time.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:35.000]   And you're looking for seven shrines of seven different deities and it's good luck to do
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.520]   it on New Years to go to all seven.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.960]   But I laid them out in one of the older neighborhoods that you could do it anytime.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.120]   And the point was just getting you through some of these back alleys so that you could
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:53.160]   see some old ceramics shops and I didn't want to name the shop because I wanted you to find
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.840]   it on your own.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   I like that.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.400]   And do you feel like for someone going on this experience, just walking into the shop,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   you don't need to know which one, you don't need to have a reservation, you can just kind
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.200]   of explore in a place like that?
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.160]   Yeah, I think sometimes when there's a really cool neighborhood that you want people to
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:16.740]   check out, it actually doesn't damage to pick the one ramen place in the neighborhood that
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:22.720]   has 10 great ramen places and I've tried all of them and the differences are negligible.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:28.440]   There's so much joy in the feeling of discovery that I'd rather just lead you to the cool
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.760]   neighborhood and then let you figure it out from there.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.960]   And I think that's what actually a lot of people want these days.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   Right now, I'm late for lunch on the West Coast and a bowl of ramen is exactly what
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.360]   I want these days.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.840]   I know so many people that plan a trip to Japan and it's "I'm going to Tokyo and I'm
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.120]   going to Kyoto."
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.840]   Where would you throw out a few places that someone going to those two cities should tack
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.840]   on?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   Sure.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.960]   I think if Kyoto is your vibe, and you're a little worried that it's going to be overrun
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.720]   with tourists, I would go to Kanazawa.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.920]   In the feudal times of Japan, Kanazawa was the second most powerful area.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.600]   So it's giving you a lot of the Kyoto vibes that you're looking for.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.320]   Less tourists, a little bit smaller scale.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:20.240]   And right outside of Kanazawa is Kaga and it's a region that has a lot of hot mineral
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   water.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:28.300]   So it's one of the most popular onsen destinations where you can go for a soak.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:34.600]   And this area has some of the coolest ryokan hotels, which are these little inns that usually
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.240]   have a hot spring attached.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:44.120]   And it's a completely inclusive, immersive stay where you're always wearing your yukata
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:49.120]   robe and you have this set dinner and everything's planned out for you.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.740]   And you're just constantly in hospitality and everything's taken care of.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.600]   I think a lot of people are really into Hokkaido, you know, leaving Honshu, the main island,
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.880]   going to Hokkaido, going to Kyushu, Shikoku is often left off of people's itineraries.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.380]   And this is the Japan that hasn't been glamorized.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:15.000]   There's a lot of really cool inns, Minshuku, where you can stay and you'll have that experience
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.120]   where you're going to cook with the person who runs the inn.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:24.800]   But because they need your help, not because you're paying them to have that commoditized
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   cooking experience.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.480]   Sounds awesome.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.520]   We are anxiously awaiting the reopening of Japan for another trip back.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.480]   It was our last trip before the pandemic.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.500]   So hearing you talk about writing The Lonely Planet for Japan, which I imagine was months
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.920]   of time getting to explore everything about the country, you know, makes me just think,
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.800]   you have the best job in the world.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.720]   And I'm sure many people listening here would agree from that perspective.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.760]   What's the downside?
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.480]   What's the downside to having a job where you basically get to go live in incredible
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.880]   places on someone else's dime, you know, eat at the best restaurants, go, you know, try
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.540]   out all these amazing hotels.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.760]   There has to be something that keeps everyone from wanting to do it.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.240]   There is a really tough pace to keep.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.960]   And I know all of us are pretty stressed by our jobs these days.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:27.560]   But the pace that you have to go into a destination, try your best to uncover everything that you
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:33.520]   need for your story, and not miss anything, but also not miss your deadline is really,
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.520]   really tough to balance.
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.480]   And for me, I've had a hard time balancing that at different points in my career.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:49.280]   And what's funny about travel is that you have to pack every day to move to a different
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   place.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.080]   And so, you have to be super mindful about the big and the small.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.760]   Travel writing is one of those skill sets that you need to know big picture, you need
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.840]   to know your destination, the context, how it sits against other destinations, and paint
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.600]   a world in your story.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.120]   And then you need to know that the bus leaves at 245, so that you don't miss it.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   And that you need to get all the things from your room, so you don't leave a bunch of stuff
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   in your room.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.880]   It only exists in the two extremes, and nothing in the middle.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.920]   And I think 99% of careers are sort of in the middle.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:34.000]   So you have to really hone your ability to think super macro and super micro.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.680]   And be willing to move a lot.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.680]   Move around.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.920]   Do you get a break?
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.200]   Well, I've been a freelancer for the last 15 years.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:49.720]   So every assignment that I've taken at Lonely Planet was for better or for worse.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:55.160]   I could opt out of something to take a break, or I could always opt in.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.440]   And I think when you're a freelancer, you want to always opt in because you don't know
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.540]   when you're going to have to get off the ride.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:07.120]   You have to make sure to keep it sustainable because you can't let your work and the quality
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.320]   of your work degrade.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.560]   You need to let yourself get excited for a trip.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.720]   And I see a lot of journalists on different junkets who are just boom, trip, trip, trip,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.760]   trip, trip, trip, trip.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.040]   And they're missing the excitement of going on it.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.840]   And so their writing is not imbued with that wonder and that excitement for being there.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.720]   So you mentioned that you're always packing every day when you're writing these books
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.280]   and trying out these new hotels every day.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.480]   I want to talk a little about packing and the hacks around what you bring on a trip.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:44.840]   Because 3,000 hotels, you've packed your bags more than I think anyone has ever packed their
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.240]   bags ever in their life.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.760]   You've probably thought about every single item you bring on a trip, every type of clothing,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.240]   everything more than once.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.920]   What are things you've learned in that process?
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.600]   Well, there was a time when I was really into this one particular bag.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:10.120]   It was called the over/under bag because it was a rolling suitcase that was a bit squishy.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.040]   And it was two different sizes depending on a zipper.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.840]   So going on the trip, it could be a carry on.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.240]   And then if you bought things while you were there, it could expand to a bag that went
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.360]   under the plane.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.100]   I was really obsessed with this bag for a long time.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:32.960]   And also, you want to have a soft bag if part of your trip is going to be on a small airplane.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:40.240]   So it's great to have the Rimowa and those kinds of bags that have a hard shell to protect
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   everything within.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.180]   But you can't bring them on safari planes or puddle jumpers in the Caribbean.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:51.560]   So I would always travel, especially for Lonely Planet, with this squishy over/under because
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:55.440]   I didn't know what I was going to get myself into, but I always was prepared.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.200]   So that was my first thing.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.520]   And do you still carry it?
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.520]   Yeah, I still have it.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.240]   What else are you bringing?
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.200]   Shoes, cameras?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.560]   What kinds of things do you bring to make a trip perfect for you?
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:15.920]   If there's one thing that you want to whittle down, it's shoes because they take up so much
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.320]   room.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.000]   They are filthy.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.400]   And so if you can have a versatile shoe that can read, you can go to a nice restaurant
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:31.440]   in a certain shoe, but you can also do a really long walk, I would invest in that and invest
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.860]   in a very comfortable version of that.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   That's the first thing.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.580]   You don't want to fill your bag with five different pairs of shoes.
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.120]   Is there a shoe or two you found that do that?
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.800]   I like Palladiums a lot.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:54.040]   They're really durable, and I think they were made for the French army using leftover tires
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   or something.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.440]   It's like how the company got started.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.080]   And now they're like a super durable shoe.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.120]   You can go on a hike.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.840]   And they're cool enough looking that you can definitely wear them to a bar.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.020]   What about taking photos?
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.080]   Are you someone who brings a nice camera?
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.360]   Do you now just rely on your phone?
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.120]   Do you try not to take photos and be in the moment?
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   I've looked at your Instagram.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.980]   I know there are some photos there.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:26.800]   Talk about how you balance capturing a trip with really experiencing a destination.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.240]   Yeah, photography is tricky.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:35.800]   I think that a lot of people live their lives on social media.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.080]   And when you're in a place, you'll find that people are looking at the destination through
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.400]   their phone.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.080]   And for some people that works, that's not really my bag.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.240]   I tend to be very present in what I'm doing, and I forget sometimes to post on social media.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.520]   I'm not huge on social media, but I do enjoy making people jealous every once in a while
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.880]   with a fun photo.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:02.640]   I'll take a lot of photos to jog my memory for when I'm writing up an article after I
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.840]   get home.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.880]   And there have been these moments that I wanted to capture when I see something truly unique.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   And it's usually not the sunset at the Eiffel Tower of which there's already 50 better versions.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   But I like capturing those moments of serendipity.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:30.640]   The best example I can think of was on a trip to Kyrgyzstan a few years ago.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:36.000]   I was with a group of semi-nomadic people.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:43.800]   And they had a really busted up old car that they were driving around in, and they were
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.440]   eagle hunters.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:53.600]   And we got out of the car, parked, and the father put his eagle on his arm before he
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.480]   let it go hunt.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   And it's this photo of this.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:07.000]   He's wearing these two thousand skins, the eagle is on his arm, cawing, and there's this
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.520]   beaten up car from 1972 right beside him.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.960]   It's this bizarre moment of juxtaposition and I just had to have it.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.800]   It couldn't just be a memory for me.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.480]   It had to be a photo.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.940]   It's not a quantity thing for you.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:28.380]   It's trying to find the moments that are really different and something that you'd want to
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.000]   look back on and remember.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.720]   Yeah, I don't want a photo that someone's already taken a better version.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.960]   I want to capture my moments of serendipity.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.360]   That's what I use photography for.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.180]   Today's episode is brought to you by Riverside.
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:48.080]   And I mean this episode literally wouldn't exist without it.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.920]   Riverside is far and above the best platform out there to record studio quality podcasts
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.300]   or videos from anywhere in the world.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:00.640]   I use it for all my remote interviews and it consistently delivers high quality audio
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   and video.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.780]   And it's not just me that loves Riverside, tens of thousands of creators and top companies
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.620]   like Spotify and the New York Times use it to create their content.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.860]   What's amazing about Riverside is that it records everything locally, which means you
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:23.420]   get high quality uncompressed audio and video that works even with unstable or slow Wi-Fi.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:28.100]   Then once your recording's done, you can use their editor to make ready to publish video
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.020]   with a few clicks.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.940]   Or you can easily download separate audio and video tracks and edit until your heart's
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.940]   content.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.560]   I don't know where I would be without Riverside.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.700]   So if you're looking to collaborate with others to make audio or video content, you should
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.800]   definitely check them out.

[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.220]   You've traveled a lot, what are your favorite hacks that we haven't hit on already?
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.440]   I really like helping people plan their trips.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.140]   And I know that we touched a little bit on some of the big picture things.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:25.880]   But one rule that I like to apply to a lot of trip planning is an hour on a plane for
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.000]   a day in the destination.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.120]   And you don't have to follow it exactly, but it goal tends a little bit.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.840]   If you're going to fly across the country, across America, and it's going to take 4-5
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.600]   hours, try to have 4-5 days, because you're going to spend so much time in transit.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:51.500]   Flying is tricky, you have to be there early, you're going to be on the flight.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:56.920]   Bank some time in the destination, or pick a closer destination if you only have 2 days.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:03.720]   If you're only doing a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, pick a place that's an hour's flight.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:10.320]   Don't try to go to Paris for 2 days, you're just going to end up tired and not getting
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.800]   out of it what you wanted.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:20.480]   So one hour in the plane for one day in the destination.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.120]   I would design an itinerary like the way you read a book, like the way you read a fairy
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:30.840]   tale, where it starts off where you're setting the world.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.880]   So you're understanding the world in a broader way, and then there's turmoil.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:43.200]   And that means a difficult experience, give yourself a challenge, get out of the box,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.200]   try something new.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:50.720]   It can be a physical challenge, a big hike, an overnight camping, something that maybe
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.680]   is a little bit unusual for you, and then have a happy ending.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   So put your best hotel at the end, put your most expensive hotel at the end.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:07.280]   You don't want everything else to feel disappointing, because it came after the best thing you did.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:12.400]   Is there a place you think people are overspending or underspending?
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.080]   Are they spending too much on food when they travel or hotels when they travel?
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.900]   And if they spent their money in a different way, they might have a better trip?
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.480]   It's interesting to look at nationalities and how they spend.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:30.200]   A lot of different cultures will spend way more on hotels and then way less on food,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.600]   like Americans, for example.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:41.760]   But then you see Israelis, for example, actually spend way more on food than they do on hotels.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.920]   So there's a lot of cultural differences that dictate how we're spending our money in our
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.520]   different destinations.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:54.040]   Americans really like to have the comfort, they like to have their nice big bathroom,
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.320]   and a clean toilet and a nice bed.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.560]   That's super important to them.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:05.520]   And so I can't really judge how people are going to spend their money when they're away.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:11.660]   But what I can say is that there are a lot of big value destinations, places where your
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.560]   dollar is going to go way further than the place you thought you wanted to go.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.240]   I love Iceland, and I'll tell you everything you want to know.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:26.360]   I've written books about Iceland, but if you're looking for those chiseled fjords and tundra
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:35.720]   and wildlife or, you know, big night skies, and you think that it's going to be Iceland,
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:41.440]   I would challenge you to think of somewhere that might seem less sexy, like Newfoundland
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.640]   in Canada.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.480]   It looks like it broke off from Iceland, and I think it really did.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.360]   Because all the fjords, you're going to get the whales puffing in the bay, you're going
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.960]   to get icebergs floating by, incredible accommodation, incredible food, the fish, oh my God, you
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.680]   know, the biggest fishing banks in the world are off the coast of Newfoundland.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:10.560]   And you're going to spend kroners in Iceland, you're going to spend Canadian dollars, which
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:14.480]   is like monopoly money for an American in Canada.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   Wow.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.680]   Are there other places like that where you'd say, "If this is what you were looking for,
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.400]   here's an awesome thing you haven't considered."
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.240]   Or just, "Here's an awesome thing you haven't considered."
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.120]   Yeah, sure.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.480]   If you're thinking about mountains and Alps, and you want to go to Switzerland or France
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:41.960]   or Italy, and you want your Lake Como and you want to have your Heidi experience, go
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.120]   to Slovenia instead.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.280]   It's right next door.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.040]   It's still in the Alps.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.360]   You're getting those snow-capped mountains, you're getting the lakes, you're getting food
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.500]   that is basically cheaper Italian food.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.960]   You're going into people's homes and they're smoking salamis in their basement, and you're
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:10.360]   having wine that shares veins of loam and soil with some of the most famous Italian
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   wines.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.080]   But very few people think to go to Slovenia.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.120]   I'm going to let you keep going because I now have two new places to go on my list.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.200]   So, what else do we hit up?
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:26.080]   I think that people want to go to Australia because they want to see the other end of
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   the world.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080]   I love Australia.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.220]   I think the color of the sky in Australia is different than it is in America.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.120]   That's the first thing that you'll notice.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.200]   It's this place of incredible desolation when you get out of the cities.
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.960]   A lot of people think that they want to go up the East Coast, Queensland.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   They want to go to Cairns.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.960]   They want to see the Great Barrier Reef, but go to Western Australia.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   That's where it's at.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:57.960]   Because if you want that orange desert, the Uluru sand, and you want the Turquoise Bay,
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   they actually collide in Western Australia.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:09.340]   So, if you're on the Ningaloo Reef or you're in Exmouth, Shark Bay, all that bright orange
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:17.040]   sand from Uluru hits the coastline at the clearest water you will ever see halfway up
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.800]   the coast between Perth and Broome.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   That's amazing.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   Any...
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.520]   I mean, you write about a lot of this.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.340]   You wrote a whole article on where to go in 2022 that I'll link here.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:34.960]   Any other places to highlight from that list that someone thinking about maybe a trip in
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.120]   the fall this year should consider that they probably weren't already thinking about?
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.280]   So, I'll let you in on a secret.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:47.160]   I actually consult on a lot of those lists for a lot of different magazines.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:56.640]   So, I contributed to a list for Harper's Bazaar this year, and I also contributed to the list
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   for Bloomberg.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.840]   And they're very different readers.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:08.000]   Bloomberg tends to skew male active, Harper's Bazaar tends to be their mistresses.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   And so, I pick very different places depending on the audience.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.320]   I try to tailor those lists to whoever's paying attention.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.720]   Creating those lists has been hugely difficult for the last few years because of geopolitics
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.840]   and COVID.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:31.400]   And I think what we're seeing in travel right now is a return to travel 101, where people
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.520]   miss the places they like to go.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:41.440]   We're seeing a lot of interest in France, in Italy, in Greece, and the UK, and Ireland.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.560]   People really want to go back to Japan.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:51.520]   Whereas before the pandemic, in the year leading up to the pandemic, I was in Uzbekistan, The
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:59.440]   Gambia, I mean, I was dipping into places that were on the verge of being on our mental
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.760]   maps.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:09.160]   So I would encourage people to go back to the places that they miss first, fulfill that
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.800]   need, and then start looking at the new.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:23.080]   And I know that that's not a super sexy answer, but I think that there's a lot of places that
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.680]   are perfectly pronounceable that we should be checking out.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:31.760]   Next week, I'm going to Madeira, for example, a Portuguese-owned island off the coast of
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   Africa.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.200]   And I think that strikes the perfect balance of familiar and new.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.040]   Because Portugal has been trending for a few years now.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.080]   It's the places that everyone in the travel media world has hit.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.200]   Madeira is a little off-kilter, right?
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.360]   It's going to give you that Portuguese sensibility, but you're going to get these volcanic crags
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.400]   and you're going to get passing whales, and you're going to stay in a quinta instead of
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   a hotel.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:02.000]   You're going to stay in a little inn that's tended to by local individuals.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.200]   And you're going to eat fresh seafood, and you're going to see a different version of
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.280]   a place that you know.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.720]   I think I have whales on my radar, too, this year for another story.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:19.320]   Again, a slightly off-kilter version of something you probably already know, the UK.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:25.880]   But we're going to go into little villages and crumbling castles, and there's a huge
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.520]   whiskey industry that has really grown over the last 20 years, and now they're ready to
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.560]   compete with scotch.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.000]   And I want to go see what that's about.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.640]   So it's like, everything is like version 2.1.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.760]   Is there an argument to be made that if the hottest places in travel right now are the
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:52.880]   Spain, the Italy, the France, now is the year to go and go counter, go to Uzbekistan, go
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.720]   to the places that no one's wanting to go to.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:00.280]   Is that where maybe the best deals are to be had in the next year or two?
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:06.880]   I think we're running into something a little tricky, which is that there is this sort of
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.320]   latent xenophobia that we're finding because countries are concerned about how other countries
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.780]   handled COVID.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:20.600]   And we're seeing supply chain issues.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:27.880]   We're seeing this sort of fake fuel issue, and everyone's sort of girding their loins.
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:35.040]   And what we're going to see is that travel will be easier based on where trade already
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   occurs.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:42.160]   So, Canada, America, Mexico is going to remain a really easy artery to travel within.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:46.680]   Europe will be easy for Europeans, Asia is sort of multipolar, so you're going to see
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:52.240]   easy travel within the Middle East, easy travel within South Asia, East Asia.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:59.400]   It's going to remain easier to travel in our regional bubbles, and prices will go up if
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.160]   you want to bust through that bubble.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:09.660]   Also if you can find that inexpensive plane ticket to Uzbekistan, seize the opportunity
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:14.720]   because unfortunately, I think that will only get worse.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.320]   So you mentioned Uzbekistan as a great place.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   What's on your list?
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.940]   I think you've hit, what, 130 countries.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.960]   Are there places that somehow you've just never had the opportunity to go to, but you
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   really want to?
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:28.960]   And when are you going?
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:35.760]   So yeah, I have been to about 130 countries, and I do not want to be accused as a country
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:41.560]   counter because I've been to Iceland 37 times.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.520]   I have three trips to Tahiti planned this year.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:51.200]   I like to go back to a lot of places that I know, and I like to dig even deeper.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:57.920]   I do try to find opportunities to visit somewhere new, but I want it to be organic.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.120]   I don't want to go somewhere and not have a plan or a point of view or an idea for a
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   story.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.900]   I like to go everywhere with a mission.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:09.600]   And I think that's a really good piece of information for solo travelers.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.240]   Find a mission for your trip so you don't feel lost.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:19.480]   My mission tends to be finding information and personalities for an article.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:26.080]   And so when things start to bake in those places, I prioritize that new place.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:33.160]   I am really interested in countries that are about to pivot from oil to tourism.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:41.120]   I think a lot of places are just totally off the map because they've never been interested
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.760]   in garnering tourists until now.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:53.040]   So a country like Angola off the coast of Southwest Africa, because they've done so
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:59.120]   much offshore drilling, the interior of their country is pristine.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:09.260]   And we've seen so many parts of Southern Africa get turned into agriculture or forms of monetizing
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.260]   the land.
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.820]   But this is a country that is wild in the interior.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.160]   And I want to go before it develops.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.400]   So I tried so hard to go to Angola.
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.520]   And I don't mean that in a strange way.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:28.480]   I physically tried so hard because we were in Namibia and there was a river between Namibia
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.920]   and Angola, and we had a hand dug canoe and a guy I had met traveling from Sweden and
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:43.980]   I attempted to row to the other side to go say hi to some people that were in Angola.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:48.800]   And we literally could not cross the current of the river and we tried so hard.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:55.320]   So Angola has a special place for me as one of the few countries that I could maybe even
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.160]   throw a rock to, but I physically was not able to get myself into.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:05.000]   Now, I have no idea what the legal ramifications of crossing the border in an unauthorized
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.960]   place would have been separate, but was not possible physically.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.840]   I have been on the Kunene River myself and crossed and touched into Angola, but I don't
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:20.960]   count it because I was actually trying to say hi to some people too and crossed, touched
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.360]   down, you know, but in my mind, I was like, "Oh, I can't count this as a visit.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:29.280]   I need to go to Luanda and start from the beginning."
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.640]   Do you have a requirement for you to say you've been to a place?
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.520]   Obviously, you can't just be touching the ground.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:37.960]   Do you think you need to spend a night there, a meal there?
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.320]   What's your rule?
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.920]   My personal rule is that, first of all, I need to be choosing to go there.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.360]   So a lot of people who've had a layover in a country, they say that they've been to that
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.360]   country.
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.360]   That doesn't count for me.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.720]   It needs to be my end destination.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:57.480]   It can be, you know, part of a three-country trip or something like that, but I have to
[00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:01.160]   spend a night in that place as well.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.400]   It used to be that you had to get a stamp, but you know, so many countries don't use
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400]   stamps now.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.200]   So you mentioned you write a lot for Bloomberg now.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:14.500]   And there is a series of articles --I wish they had a title-- that you've written.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.540]   And I went deep on them.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.560]   And I imagine when I start talking about them, people listening will too.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.040]   So I don't even know how it all started.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.480]   So I'd love to hear the story.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:32.520]   But best I understand it, you spend a few days to a week doing a hospitality job at
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:38.680]   the intersection of really high-end luxury, and report on the inner workings.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.760]   I read about you working on a private jet at a high-end hotel, being the maitre d' at
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.400]   Nobu, working on a luxury yacht.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.640]   How did that happen?
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.440]   And how has that experience been?
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.360]   The origin story is totally random.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.320]   And we did not think it was going to turn into a column.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.600]   A friend of mine used to work for Norwegian.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.840]   And they started long-haul flights between North America and Europe.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.800]   And they were so well-priced, and they were all new planes.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.680]   And even the business class on the plane, the premium economy was pretty comfortable
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680]   and inexpensive.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.960]   And he was pitching it to me for an article.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.480]   And I was like, "Listen, I love this.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.200]   It all sounds great.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.680]   It's not reinventing the wheel, though."
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:38.240]   And he was like, "Well, what if you worked as a flight attendant on one of our planes?"
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.040]   And I was like, "Well, that sounds crazy.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.600]   I mean, that sounds cool, but crazy how I'm not trained."
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.440]   And it took three months of getting all these different approvals.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.720]   And we did it completely above board.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.480]   And sure enough, I worked as a flight attendant on a long-haul flight from London to New York.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.440]   And I interviewed my colleagues.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.240]   And I reported authentically on what it was like to be on that plane.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.520]   And the traffic on that story was absurd.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.840]   We'd never seen numbers like that for a travel story at Bloomberg.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.640]   And then we thought, "What if I did another job?"
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:20.000]   And the next job that I did was I was a butler at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.660]   And that story did even better.
[01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.000]   And from then on, in-house, we kind of called it the butler stories.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.640]   "Oh, what's the next butler story that you're going to do?"
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:35.960]   Because the vibe of it was service.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.840]   So service heroics is essentially what it is.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.840]   And I go all over the world to the world's most coveted brands.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.120]   I embed myself in the product.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.000]   I serve the wealthy elite of the world.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.440]   And I report on what it's like to do so.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.680]   So I was a personal shopper at Barney's, I was a maitre d' at Nobu.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.240]   I was a ski instructor in Aspen.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:09.160]   I worked on a superyacht in the Caribbean, a private jet in Texas.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.280]   I just actually finished another one.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.200]   I'm on deadline to write it all up.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.640]   And that one will be coming out at the end of April.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:24.760]   Are there some examples of some of the most interesting things you've seen or learned?
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:31.280]   I will fully endorse anyone listening to go read them, but throw out a few of the good
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.200]   juicy bits to get people excited.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.320]   I think the first thing that comes to mind is what really propelled this into a different
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.560]   stratosphere, which was for the Plaza Hotel.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.920]   I was on break and I was chatting with my fellow butlers and I was just like, what's
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   the deal with Eloise?
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.280]   You know, there's the Eloise children's book about how she lives in the Plaza Hotel.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.260]   And he was like, oh yeah, you know, it's a really big deal.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.320]   Everyone loves Eloise here.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.920]   You know, one time a room called and asked for a butler to bring up the Eloise book and
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.280]   read them a bedtime story to read Eloise, you know, as the bedtime story.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.000]   And I was like, okay, sure.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   That's a little quirky.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   And when we got up to the room, there was no child in the room.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:26.080]   There were four adults in their thirties all in the same bed, like Charlie Bucket's grandparents.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.680]   And they were all like, okay, read us the story now, please.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:36.880]   And he read them Eloise for like 90 minutes and they were like, hey, thank you.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.880]   That's all.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:47.840]   That was the perfect amount of quirkiness to launch the series into popularity.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.400]   And every time I do one of these jobs, I'm sniffing around for the Eloise moment.
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.600]   I don't need to tell you about the sex, drugs, and rock and roll because yeah, it's a private
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.280]   chat on a super yacht.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.480]   Are you surprised people are doing sex, drugs, and rock and roll?
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.480]   No.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.040]   Are you surprised that someone is reading for adults, a children's book as a bedtime
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040]   story?
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.040]   That's more fun.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.040]   So I'm trying to find the humor in it.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.040]   There's humor.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.840]   I mean, there's still absurdity.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:22.400]   I read that someone had Fiji water installed in their house and including their shower.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.420]   Someone that spent tens of thousands of dollars to raise the height of the sink in their bathroom
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:33.880]   at a hotel, which I think you said they literally needed to involve construction equipment.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.920]   Actually, that is one of the other things that I think about often.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.840]   It was a hotel in Chicago and a couple was going to Chicago for like a three-day weekend.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.960]   And the wife called the hotel and was like, do me a favor, measure how high the vanity
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   is off the floor.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   They were like, okay.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   Yeah, we'll get back to you.
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   Oh, it's whatever.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   It's 45 inches.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.320]   And she's like, that's not going to do, it needs to be 52.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:05.480]   And they were like, okay, well, we'll raise it, but it's a marble vanity, so we're going
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.440]   to need to get new marble and it'll cost about $55,000.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.720]   She's like, okay, sounds good.
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.540]   So they raised it.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:18.400]   She stayed for three nights and that's all she wrote.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:25.400]   And the reason was she didn't like bending down too far to wash her face.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   I'm not even...
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.080]   I don't even have words.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:36.520]   The number of vacations you could take for the cost of raising that sink or finding another...
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.320]   I don't know why she didn't find another hotel that maybe had a higher sink, seemed cheaper
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.640]   or easier, but wow.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:48.520]   You worked as a maitre d at a hot restaurant in New York, you worked at a hotel, you worked
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:54.620]   in a lot of the kinds of places that me, you, people listening will end up going to or wanting
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.960]   to go to.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.240]   What did you learn when it comes to ways that we might apply some tricks or some tips or
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:08.440]   some tactics to get the reservation at the hard-to-get-to table or to get the upgrade
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:13.960]   at the hotel or get the good treatment on the plane from the flight attendants or something
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   like that?
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:23.080]   At Nobu, I spent an afternoon with the reservations team because I was really curious how to hack
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.440]   that on a personal level.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:35.760]   And they said that the best time to call is at around 4.15 p.m. because a lot of people
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.240]   do last-minute cancellations.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.280]   And they will do it when they see their dinner coming on the horizon, they realize they're
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.920]   going to be late or someone can't make it.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:52.960]   And that happens before 5.00, but usually a little bit after 4.00.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.860]   They said right in that 4.15 sweet spot was if you called day of, you could probably get
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.860]   a table.
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:05.480]   I've heard a lot of people for everything from restaurant reservations to even daycare,
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:11.720]   where it's like, even though we have a waitlist, we usually just take whoever calls first.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.920]   And so I imagine that was maybe similar at Nobu.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.160]   There might be people that say, "If something opens up, give me a call," but they're going
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.200]   to prioritize whoever just calls in the moment.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   Definitely.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.920]   I think you can certainly give them a ring and say, "If anything opens up, give me a
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.920]   call."
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:25.920]   And then you need to be proactive.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.680]   You need to call at 4.20 or 4.30 and say, "I'd really like to come in.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.720]   What can we make happen?"
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.800]   I think the less constraints you put on that reservation too, the likelier it is that you'll
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.440]   find a place.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.840]   What about tipping?
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.560]   Go up to the maitre d' and offer a tip to get a table.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.720]   Is that a real thing?
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:46.720]   Nah.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.600]   I think that that's a dated TV show kind of thing.
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:09:01.360]   I don't think that that's going to work, but they do leave tables open for VIPs.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.240]   They are ready at a moment's notice.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.840]   If Blake Lively walks in the door and she wants a table, they're going to give her one.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.120]   So it's really more about who you know.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:15.640]   One thing that you could do -- everyone's going to hate that I say this -- is everyone's
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:20.880]   always thinking about concierges at hotels in the cities that they're going to visit.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.160]   Make friends with a concierge at a hotel in the city you live in because a lot of times,
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:37.640]   what people will do is they will hold tables for concierge friends at Four Seasons or at
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:43.760]   a St. Regis or something like that, so that when they have a big spender come and stay
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.260]   at the hotel, they can funnel them a table right away.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:55.920]   So go to a hotel in your hometown and try to make friends with the concierge there.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.660]   And that'll often work.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.580]   How would you suggest doing that?
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.720]   How would you make friends with the concierge?
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:08.160]   I honestly think that you could just go in and ask.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.960]   A lot of times, a concierge will say, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:17.800]   We only serve people in the hotel," or something like that.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:26.920]   But a lot of them are really skilled and they're really well-trained in the art of the concierge
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.520]   business, especially the ones with the clÃ© d'or, the golden keys that are on their lapel.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   And sometimes they really want something to do that is germane to their skillset.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.100]   And so they will help you because these days, they're underused.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.800]   It's a lot of, "Oh, can you send my bags up to my room?"
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.460]   Or the things that they don't get much joy in doing, which is illuminating the destination
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.040]   for their guests.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.260]   Okay.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.360]   So that's the plan.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.720]   You make a reservation at a hotel restaurant and get there an hour early and spend some
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.360]   time with the concierge.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   Are there...
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.640]   You mentioned earlier bringing gifts while you're traveling.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.120]   Is that...
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:14.320]   Not tipping, but is there a gift or something nice to bring to service people that might
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.280]   be better than a tip in any case?
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.080]   All the flight attendants told me that they responded really well to bribery.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.120]   I think you could make an argument that if you learn your server's names and you learn
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:32.760]   your flight attendant's names, that it endears them a little bit more to you.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.900]   But they really respond to candy.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:39.440]   They don't get to eat the stuff that's on the flight.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.520]   They eat something different.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.880]   And there are systems in place where pilots and flight attendants are all eating different
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.240]   things just in case the food is bad and everyone gets sick.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.240]   There's always someone on the plane that's able to control the situation.
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.560]   They tend to eat pretty poorly.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:07.680]   It's a lot of easily transportable stuff, bags of chips and things like that.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.840]   So I bet if you brought a healthy snack for a flight attendant, they would really appreciate
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   it.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.440]   They also dress the part.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.160]   I think flying...
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.520]   And this is something that I think a lot of people have said before.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:29.240]   I always wear black on an airplane because if something spills on me, you can't see it.
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:33.200]   And it just makes you look cleaner.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.600]   Black always tends to read chic.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.900]   Colors tend to read pajamas.
[01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:46.800]   And people don't really dress up for plane travel the way they used to.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:55.720]   And I think if you present yourself more agnostically, your ability to say right before everyone's
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.920]   boarding like, "Oh, is there room in Comfort Plus or Premium Economy?"
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.840]   They will size you up because if they're moving people to the front of the plane, they want
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.800]   them to look good.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.800]   Has that worked?
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.680]   Have you been upgraded on a flight in the moment successfully?
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.800]   I definitely have.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:18.920]   And sometimes it's just asking at the right moment.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.840]   If there's a line and they're servicing 50 people in front of you, there's no chance
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840]   in hell.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.260]   But if no one's there, the plane's boarding, you can tell by...
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.000]   Look at the seat plan on your app of how many seats there are.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   If you can tell that it seems like there's not a lot of people boarding, yeah, just ask.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.680]   I mean, especially for something like Comfort Plus on Delta, if there's an empty seat.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:49.580]   It certainly doesn't hurt to ask if the gate agents are not busy.
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:52.560]   In the intro, I talked about this book you wrote.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.520]   And I want to make sure we touch on it because it's pretty crazy.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:05.200]   I looked at your Amazon author biography, and it's like 40 Lonely Planets and a book
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.000]   about murder, mutiny in the South Pacific.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.640]   And I was like, "Oh, that's okay."
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.400]   And I dug in.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.080]   And first off, I learned that there's a part of the world I've never even heard of -- the
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.640]   Picarin Islands.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:20.340]   Talk a little bit about what drove you to write this book, what it is, who it's for.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.640]   I found it fascinating.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.520]   And I talked to my wife about it and she's like, "Can I read that next?"
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:29.320]   So yeah, I'd love you to share a little bit more.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:34.880]   When I worked at Lonely Planet, we definitely traded in obscure geography.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.560]   We'd all traveled the world and we were all looking for these weird points on the map
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.600]   that no one else had heard of.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.800]   And Picarin was a name that kept coming up because you can't get there using commercial
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   conveyance.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.300]   But people live on this remote island, and it is one of the most remotely inhabited islands
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.400]   in the world.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.440]   And only 48 people live there.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:04.840]   It's in the middle of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Peru, if that gives
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.880]   you any sense of how vast and forgotten this place is.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.660]   And the only way to get there is by cargo freighter.
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:15.560]   And a freighter services the island four times a year, once every season.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:21.160]   And you can travel on the freighter if there's room and you can stay until the next time
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.680]   the freighter comes to make a delivery.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:34.040]   And I had traveled extensively through Papua New Guinea on my own with the help of someone
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.280]   who works in the industry.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.660]   And she reached out to me one day a few years later and was like, "There's an opportunity
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:43.240]   to send one journalist to this very forgotten island."
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.480]   And I knew it because of my time at Lonely Planet.
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.520]   So she arranged for my transfer on the cargo freighter, and I ended up spending some time
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.440]   there living amongst these 48 individuals who, of course, there's no hotel because how
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.960]   do you get there to stay in a hotel?
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.800]   There's no restaurant, so you're just living in these people's homes.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.240]   And I went thinking I was going to write an article for Travel and Leisure magazine, and
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.240]   I did.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:14.200]   But when I left the island, I was just completely obsessed with everything that I learned while
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.080]   I was there about the people who live there today and about the history.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.000]   And usually, when I take on a project for work, I fall in love with the destination,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.160]   I marry it, I make the article, and then I go and fall in love with something else.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.020]   And Pig Heron was this place that I just kept thinking about and thinking about.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:39.160]   And all the characters involved in the founding of the island and all the characters that
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.360]   live there today could all have their own articles.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:50.840]   And I realized I needed to write like a 100,000 word article, which of course is a book.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:58.720]   So it wasn't until after I got back from Pig Heron that I was just like, "Okay, I got to
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720]   keep researching.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.080]   I need to know the truth about this place.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:06.440]   I need to know all the details about how it was founded 200 years ago and why it's such
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.320]   a crazy place to visit now."
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:14.480]   Pig Heron is the kind of place that once you know three sentences about it, you're going
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.200]   to be instantly obsessed because the island was founded about 200 years ago when these
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:26.520]   British sailors mutinied against their captain, threw him overboard, stole the ship, and disappeared
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.680]   with their Tahitian brides.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.200]   And for 20 years, no one knew where they went.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.120]   They thought the ship had vanished, essentially.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:39.840]   And then they were discovered living on an island that was previously uninhabited.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:47.680]   But of all the men and women that went to the island, there was only one man left when
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.080]   they found the island 18 years later.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:56.640]   And it turned out that it was like a real life game of Survivor where they were, instead
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.800]   of voting each other off the island, they were murdering each other.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:07.560]   And there were alliances that formed, there was jealousy and secrets, and one by one they
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.400]   plotted and killed each other.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.160]   When they were escaping an oppressive world, they then created an oppressive world.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.760]   And before they were all murdered, some of them had kids with each other, and then it's
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.820]   those descendants, those seventh generation descendants of the original mutineers that
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.240]   still live there today.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:33.440]   And they're haunted by the trauma of the island's founding.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.280]   And so my book zippers the two timelines together.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.800]   So it seesaws back and forth, one chapter present day, one chapter 200 years ago.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:51.680]   And as the story goes on, the two timelines get more and more intertwined, and suddenly
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:57.480]   they're completely overlapping and there's this pendulum swing of cause and effect against
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   the two.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   And, you know, of course, it sort of ends with a bang because, you know, by the end
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.240]   of at least the 200 year old timeline, everyone's dead.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.800]   The book's fantastic.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:15.440]   Rarely, if ever, do I know of a book that's like a thriller, mystery, fiction, you know,
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.360]   enthralling story, but just also happens to be one of the craziest true stories of all
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.520]   time.
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.580]   And weaves in, you know, a travel narrative as well.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:25.720]   It's fantastic.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   Definitely check it out.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.200]   I could do a whole nother episode about just learning about that island, though I don't
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.680]   think it fits in with the theme of the show.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.640]   So to wrap up, you know, we talked about a lot of places.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:45.600]   I want you to pick one place or two that I want you to pick a place that you feel like
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.400]   you're familiar with, which unfortunately, for all the guidebooks you've written might
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.320]   be too many and and leave us with a few things, a place, a place or two that people should
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:57.440]   go eat, a place or two that people should get a drink and just an activity that they
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440]   might not think to do.
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.120]   Yeah, you know, and I want this to be really useful.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:04.420]   I want I want there to be value here.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:11.040]   And I think I want to pick two places because they're both really popular.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:19.120]   I want to start with Iceland because I it's really close to the US and to Europe.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.960]   And it's a really big impact destination because once you touch down, it just it looks like
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:24.960]   another planet.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.200]   The thing is, is everyone does it wrong.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.320]   And you know, I want to tell you, take a month and see all of Iceland.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.800]   We don't all have a month.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.320]   So if you have four days, spend one of them in Reykjavik.
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.680]   People often do the opposite.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.840]   They usually base themselves in Reykjavik and then do one day in the countryside, flip
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.640]   the script, stay outside of the city, venture into the city for one day.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.840]   It's a teeny tiny city of 250,000 people.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.240]   There's some cool cafes and whatnot.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.080]   But the reason you're there is not for the urban environment.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.560]   You're there for the nature.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:05.920]   I think you should forget the golden circle, which is just a marketing thing.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.740]   Go your own way up to the SnÃ¦fellsnes Peninsula.
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.740]   It's a loop.
[01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.140]   You can loop the peninsula.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:15.360]   There's really cool places to stay like Hotel Eielson.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.220]   It's spelled like Eagleson.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.320]   It's a beautiful little boutique inn.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.940]   I highly recommend it.
[01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:26.420]   There's a great restaurant right across the street from that hotel.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.540]   That's a whole evening unto itself.
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:32.780]   I think you should explore some of the public pools.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:39.740]   There's a lot of Blue Lagoon and all of these commoditized luxury spa experiences.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:46.140]   The public pools have the same geothermal water and they're $8 rather than $80.
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.280]   And that's an opportunity where you get to meet locals.
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:51.540]   People go to the pool every day and they want to talk.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.820]   Awesome.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.820]   What's the other place?
[01:21:53.820 --> 01:22:03.100]   I think we're all desperate to go back to Japan or go to Japan for the first time.
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:06.260]   I love it there.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:11.340]   I just feel passionate about Japan.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:18.220]   I would love for people to focus on Tokyo in the southwest part of the city.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:24.540]   The Yamanote line is a ring line that goes around the city by rail.
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:26.460]   A lot of people tend to stick to that line.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.340]   I would encourage you to get out of it in the southwest quadrant.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.060]   You want to be in Setagaya.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.400]   That's the part of the city you want to be in.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:42.260]   You're going to find super cool neighborhoods out there like Shimokitazawa, Daikanyama,
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:48.780]   Geogauka, these are places that you should just go, put your feet down, walk the streets,
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:53.180]   you're going to find really cool little restaurants, tea houses.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:59.060]   This is everything that Brooklyn wishes it could be.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.340]   Anything specific to check out?
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.500]   So when you're in Shimokitazawa, for example, what you want to do is you want to go to everyone's
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.540]   favorite coffee shop called Bear Pond.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:14.940]   They make the best espresso, I promise you.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:18.300]   Everyone who's gone has absolutely loved it.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.160]   Take that walking around.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:26.020]   Everyone in Japan's okay with walking with your beverage now, they used to not be.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.860]   You're going to want to walk through that neighborhood.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:29.580]   You're going to want to look at the street fashion.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.340]   You're going to want to go into the vintage boutiques.
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:38.140]   You're going to want to see the clothes are just so well-maintained and super stylish.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:42.940]   If you want to understand what's on avant-garde street style, it's there.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:46.060]   If you pop over to Daikanyama, it's a little bit more high-end.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.620]   There's a bookshop in Daikanyama, Tsutaya.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.780]   It's three white buildings connected by bridges.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.540]   Maybe the best bookshop in the entire world.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:57.020]   There's a cafe inside of it as well.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:59.540]   Beautiful magazines, beautiful books.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.500]   I mean, there are things that you can bring home and put on your coffee table.
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.500]   That's awesome.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.180]   Ready to go back to Japan.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:13.700]   Before we wrap, where can people follow all the stuff you're doing, writing, posting photos
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.700]   and everything?
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.580]   Go to my personal website.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.820]   That's brandimpressor.com.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.860]   I tend to post my new articles there.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.840]   I have a link to my book, The Fire Land, there as well.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.260]   You can follow me on Instagram @brandpress.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:29.260]   Awesome.
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.460]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.940]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.940]   This is so much fun.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   Bye.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.940]   Bye.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:42.940]   Bye.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.940]   Bye.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.940]   Bye.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:44.940]   Bye.
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:46.940]   Bye.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:46.940]   Bye.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:48.940]   Bye.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:48.940]   Bye.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.520]   (upbeat music)
