[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.460]   Is your California dream feeling more and more distant?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.260]   You've got countless apps and influencers
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380]   telling you how to do it their way.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.660]   And your expert aunt who might be giving
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.540]   a bit too much advice.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.580]   Tips, hacks, and experts are everywhere these days.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380]   But when it comes to real estate,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.180]   the question to ask is, who's your realtor?
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200]   Because a California realtor is the only person
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.580]   who can bring your dream home.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.540]   Someone who gets that buying a home
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.080]   is one of the most complicated
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.060]   and stressful things you can do,
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.780]   but can still make it possible on your budget.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.820]   A California realtor can read the constantly shifting market
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.460]   and they're out in front for all of the tough stuff.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.140]   So you can get to the good stuff.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.780]   So who's your realtor?
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.300]   Because no one cares more about helping Californians
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.140]   live the California dream than California realtors.
