[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620]   In every generation, the Church is gifted with a few influential leaders, dynamic voices
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.440]   that emerge and leave an indelible mark on countless lives with the Gospel.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760]   Pastor John, this would include you in our current era.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.720]   However, as you well know, all such leaders eventually exit the stage.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.400]   A harsh reality we faced this spring, and this void left by such leaders can evoke fear
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.320]   about the Church's future, an anxiety put to words by Natasha from Jacksonville, Florida,
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.800]   in her email to you.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.920]   "Pastor John, your ministry has built my and my husband's faith for the last 20 years,"
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   she writes.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.040]   "We adopted three girls from Liberia inspired to not waste our lives.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.280]   I've always felt so much encouragement in my walk knowing I'm part of a larger body
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.920]   of Christian believers and leaders.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.080]   My problem is the fear that I find myself feeling over the state of the modern Church.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.920]   Many leaders have fallen to temptation or quit the ministry altogether.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.520]   Seems very few last as long as the older generations did.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.200]   When Tim Keller passed away earlier this year, I found myself worried over what leaders and
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.160]   what quality of leaders will take the baton in the future.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.120]   I know the Lord wants me to find my hope in Him and Him alone.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.680]   However, I find myself thinking negatively and would like some insight into the hope
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.560]   of the Christian Church when the elder statesmen, like yourself and Tim Keller, are gone."
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.160]   This question has a special relevance for me because I can remember the very place I
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:42.080]   was standing on our back porch in Greenville, South Carolina when I was 14 years old as
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   the fearful thought entered my mind.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.760]   What will we do if Billy Graham dies?
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.600]   I mean, I can remember that just so clearly.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.920]   It was a very powerful moment.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.080]   So some of our younger listeners may not even know who Billy Graham is, right?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.880]   I was talking to somebody the other day.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.360]   They did not know who he was.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.080]   I thought, "Oh my goodness."
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.960]   Billy Graham was the most well-known evangelical Christian in the 20th century.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.400]   As an immature provincial 14-year-old Christian, I thought, "The future of Christianity hangs
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.840]   on the preservation of Billy Graham."
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.560]   So I have tasted this anxiety expressed in this question.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:41.640]   Is there a healthy, strong future for the Bible-believing evangelical church when influential
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.680]   leaders are passing off the scene?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   Now, I think I could point out some factors among the younger generation today that would
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.040]   be encouraging.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.280]   I think I could do that, but I think it will have more lasting and deeper effect on our
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.360]   encouragement if I cite instead five scriptures that relate to this issue very definitely.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:17.720]   Number one, when the author of the book of Hebrews said in chapter 13, verse 7, "Remember
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.680]   your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.560]   Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith."
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.600]   Do you know what the very next words were out of that author's mouth after he said,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.640]   "Remember your leaders"?
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.360]   The next words were, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.800]   Now, why did he do that?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.480]   Why did he say that?
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.800]   Why was that the next thing to say after the command to remember the leaders and imitate
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.460]   their faith?
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.440]   Why a promise that Jesus is the same from generation to generation?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.320]   And surely he did that to counter the fear that if leaders are passing off the scene,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.800]   which they were, this is past tense in chapter 13, verse 7, they're passing off the scene,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.720]   then we're going to be bereft of the kind of leadership we've been used to and that
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   we need.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.480]   And to remedy that fear, the writer says, actually, Jesus will be there and he will
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.480]   be the same.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   He will do what needs to be done.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:48.520]   Number two, when Elijah was despairing over the condition of Israel in his own day, he
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.880]   said, "I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts, for the people of
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.000]   Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, killed your prophets with
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.560]   the sword, and I, even I only, am left and they seek my life to take it away."
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.200]   That's 1 Kings 19.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:22.360]   Now, the apostle Paul picks up on Elijah's despairing words and asks in Romans 11, if
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   in his own day God had rejected his people the way Elijah feels like his hope for Israel.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.440]   And he quotes Elijah's words, but then he writes, "But what does God reply to Elijah?"
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:51.320]   God's reply is, "I have kept for myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to Baal,"
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:59.240]   from which Paul concludes, "So too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.160]   grace," Romans 11, 2-5.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.560]   And the key words are, "I have kept for myself."
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.800]   So God never leaves the fate of his people to mere chance or to the vagaries of human
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.600]   history and the rise and fall of leaders, even Christian leaders.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.440]   He does the keeping of his people.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:39.000]   Third, the existence of godly leaders in Christ's church are Christ's gift to the church.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.200]   Christ's gift to the church.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.360]   Not history's gift.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.880]   Not the church's gift.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.920]   Not fate's gift.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.640]   Christ gives leaders.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.400]   They don't just happen.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.120]   They are Christ's appointment, not the mere work of man.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:01.560]   So Ephesians 4-11, "Christ gave shepherds and teachers to the church to equip the saints."
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:09.960]   Acts 20-28, "Elders, pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:18.800]   the Holy Spirit set you," ethetō in Greek, tithēme, "set you, put you as overseers."
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.360]   The Spirit did that.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   Man didn't do that.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:28.960]   Colossians 4-17, "Say to Archippus, 'See that you fulfill the ministry that you received
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.520]   from the Lord.'"
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.280]   The Lord gives the ministry.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.200]   Luke 12-42, "The Lord said, 'Who then is the faithful and wise manager whom his master
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.440]   will set over his household to give them their food at the proper time?'"
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.880]   The Lord sets managers over his household.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.680]   This is not a mere human thing.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.360]   It's not a mere matter of the ebb and flow of history.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.960]   The Lord of history appoints leaders.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.320]   So our role is Matthew 9-38.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.160]   The harvest is plentiful.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.440]   The laborers are few.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.080]   Pray the Lord of the harvest.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.440]   Pray earnestly to the Lord of the church, the Lord of the harvest, the Lord of the mission,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   the Lord of the world.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.440]   Send out laborers into your harvest.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.920]   That's what we should be praying.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.500]   We usually just restrict that text to missionaries.
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:37.200]   It means anywhere there's some initiative needed to harvest and to grow the church,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   pray it down.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:46.320]   Number four, Jesus said in Matthew 16-18, "I will build my church and the gates of
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.120]   hell shall not prevail against it."
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.960]   So ultimately, the perseverance and the strength of the church is owing to the will of the
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.760]   sovereign Christ, not to his leaders, but to Christ himself, who uses leaders and raises
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   them up.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.800]   We must always look finally to him.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:18.000]   And then fifth, when we read the history of the kings of Israel, one of the things that
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.600]   stands out is the quality, the faithfulness of the kings and how it does not depend on
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.960]   who their father was.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.160]   In other words, a very bad king may have a good son.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.880]   A good king may have a bad son.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:50.520]   So godliness in the line of Judas Kings may skip a generation or two.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.000]   You might feel this is pessimistic because I am suggesting that can happen in the evangelical
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.320]   church.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.320]   But the fact that God is in control of that and it has happened many times before means
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.480]   there's always a future.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.800]   For example, Jotham was a good king, not a perfect king, but 2 Kings 15-34 says he did
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.160]   what was right in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:22.800]   But his son Ahaz was a wicked king, but his son Hezekiah was a faithful king, but his
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:28.120]   son and grandson were wicked kings, Manasseh and Ammon.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.600]   But Ammon's son Josiah was a good king.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:41.160]   What this implies is that the godliness of leadership in one generation is no guarantee
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.240]   of the godliness of the next generation.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.960]   But more hopeful is the other implication.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:57.520]   The ungodliness of leadership in one generation is no guarantee that the next generation will
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   be ungodly.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.520]   I've seen this.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.760]   I've seen this in the church today.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:11.640]   Just when you think that the sources of faithful leadership have all gone astray, faithful
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.080]   leaders come out of nowhere.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.540]   This is what God loves to do.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.360]   In fact, this is precisely why he chose to make Abraham and Sarah the parents of all
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.440]   future godly leadership, because it was humanly impossible.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.760]   Abraham was too old.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.080]   Sarah was barren.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.120]   All hope of godly leadership coming out of their loins was futile.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   It wasn't going to happen.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:41.520]   But Paul makes it crystal clear what God was doing, and he knew what he was doing.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.280]   God, he says, made the promise to Abraham.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:55.840]   He gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that do not exist.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.080]   There it is.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.600]   So maybe the word to close on, on this issue of leadership, if you look around and you
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.200]   wonder, will there be faithful pastors and leaders to come, and you don't see what you
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:19.040]   want to see, remember, God calls into existence things that do not exist.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   Amen.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.200]   God sovereignly reigns generation by generation.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.600]   And your Billy Graham mentioned here reminds me of the story you told about when you first
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600]   met him.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.120]   You reminisced on the encounter and his life, his impact on you, and your fears for the
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.080]   future of the church when Graham would be gone.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:43.240]   All of that you shared, ironically, on the day Billy Graham passed away in 2018.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.920]   We titled that episode "On the Day Billy Graham Died."
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.480]   You can find it in the archive at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:59.280]   Well, speaking of life after loss, next time, Andrea, a broken woman who recently lost her
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.240]   husband to pancreatic cancer, seeks guidance from Pastor John on how to navigate the long
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.040]   process of returning back to a normal life.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.940]   Despite holding on to the Word of God and receiving support from friends, she's struggling
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.320]   to move on.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.040]   How do we return to normal life after tragedy?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.400]   That's up next.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   We'll see you Thursday.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   [END]
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:21.640]   1
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   Andrea Graham, Jr.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   "I'm not going to tell you about the story of Billy Graham.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   It's a story I've heard a lot of times.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   It's a story I've always heard.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   It's a story I've heard a lot of times.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   It's a story I've heard a lot of times.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   It's a story I've heard a lot of times.
