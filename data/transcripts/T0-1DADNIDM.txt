[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, we know that God is most glorified in those who most love him.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   And that is why God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.560]   But is God at all glorified in those who reject him?
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.160]   It's the question from an international listener today named Jen Red.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.080]   Jen Red asks this, "Pastor John, if God is most glorified when we are most
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.160]   satisfied in him, why does he use that nearly constant refrain so that they may
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.760]   know that I am the Lord in reference to things that would not bring about the
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.640]   satisfaction of anyone?
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   And we're certainly not done for that specific purpose.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.720]   There are many times when God seems to me perfectly content with people seeing his
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.600]   glory and realizing that he is God, even though that realization is in terror and
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.280]   in judgment.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.160]   How do you make sense of this?"
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.560]   This is a really important question, especially for someone like me, who's a
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560]   Christian hedonist.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.120]   But really, it's an important question for everyone because it's about God's
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.560]   ultimate purposes, both in painful things as well as pleasant things, and how they
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.080]   relate to the glory of God and his commitment to glorify himself in everything
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.720]   he does.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.760]   So let me restate the question so that we all have it clear and can see the
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.080]   relevance of it.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.120]   He's responding to the central claim of Christian hedonism, namely, "God is most
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.880]   glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him."
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.200]   And his question assumes, rightly, that God is zealous for his glory.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.040]   He is always committed to uphold and magnify and communicate his glory.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.640]   And he alludes to the first question of the Westminster Catechism, which asks,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.440]   "What's the chief end of man?"
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.360]   And answers, "The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever."
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.560]   So his question begins by putting in place things that we agree on.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.960]   Namely, first, God is always upholding and magnifying and communicating his glory in
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.440]   everything that he does in history.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.120]   And second, God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in him.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.200]   And those two premises, which I believe are biblical, and Jen Redd agrees, it
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.280]   seems, he believes are biblical, they create for him a problem.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.440]   For texts in Ezekiel, like, "They will know that I am the Lord when I have made the
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.760]   land a desolation because of all their abominations."
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.840]   Seventy-two times in the book of Ezekiel, the prophet says that God will do things
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.280]   so that you may know that I am the Lord.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.600]   It's astonishing, over and over again.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.120]   And Jen Redd assumes, rightly, that this is an expression of God's zeal for his
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.560]   glory, and then he spots a problem because some of these things that God does in
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   order that we may know that he is the Lord, that he may get glory, is painful
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.680]   things toward us that don't quicken in people satisfaction in God.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.920]   And so he wonders, "Well, if God is most glorified by our being satisfied in him,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.720]   how can he get glory, like Ezekiel says he does, by doing things that don't
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040]   satisfy us but damn us, send people to hell because it's judgment?"
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.920]   Now, there are at least two answers.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.480]   First, when I say God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.360]   I am referring to how God is most glorified or magnified in us, that is, in
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   us who believe.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.880]   I'm not talking about a general cosmic statement about how God maximizes his
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.480]   glory in the universe.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'm talking about whether God is more glorified this afternoon in John Piper's
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   heart and life by my being satisfied in him or whether he is more glorified this
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.400]   afternoon by my being less satisfied in him.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's the issue, because what I'm trying to argue for is that all believers should
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.360]   pursue—and I mean pursue with all their might—maximum satisfaction in God over
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.120]   against money and sex and leisure and family and even ministry.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.320]   In my argument for that pursuit, my argument for that pursuit is that God is
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:19.120]   less glorified on any given day in my heart and life if I am begrudgingly
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.760]   obedient rather than being joyfully obedient, because he satisfied my soul.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   So that's the first answer.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.480]   The statement that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.000]   is not a statement about the way God maximizes his glory in the universe and
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.080]   all his creatures.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   It's a statement about how God commands people to glorify him in this world, in
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.240]   their hearts.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:57.680]   Here's my second answer, that when people refuse to be satisfied in God and live
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.640]   lives of preferring other things to God and finding more satisfaction in other
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   things than God, the glory of his wrath is magnified when they are justly punished.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.120]   In other words, God is not only glorified when his people are satisfied in him, he
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:32.320]   is also glorified when he is defied by people and then pours out on them a just
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.800]   and holy wrath.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:43.520]   And the glory and rightness and indeed moral beauty of that wrath is made
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.000]   visible.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.720]   This is the point of Romans 9, 22 and 23.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   It goes like this.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:57.880]   "What if God, desiring to show his wrath and make known his power, has endured
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.840]   with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction in order to make
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.120]   known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.760]   for glory?"
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.120]   That's what's going on in Ezekiel when repeatedly God says, "So that you may
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.320]   know that I am the Lord," even when he's performing acts of judgment.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:32.760]   God means for the world to see him as glorious both in his mercy and his wrath.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.240]   It's not as though God is glorious when he shows mercy and inglorious when he
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.080]   shows wrath and judgment.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.360]   Both his wrath and his mercy are glorious.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.920]   They are perfectly just, perfectly proportioned, perfectly expressed.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.240]   And I would say in view of the logic of Romans 9, 22 and 23 that part of the
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   glory in the display of wrath and mercy is that the wrath is intended by God to
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   make the mercy look all the more astonishing and precious and beautiful and
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.320]   glorious.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:20.440]   So let me end the way the Bible does in the book of Revelation as the glory of
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:28.360]   God, the praises of God rise both in response to judgment and in response to
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   salvation.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.000]   Here's Revelation 19 and some excerpts from verses 1 to 7.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.880]   It goes like this, "I heard a great multitude in heaven crying out, 'Hallelujah!
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:51.360]   Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for his judgments are true and
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.920]   just, for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.640]   her immorality and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.' Once more they
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   cried, 'Hallelujah!
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.760]   The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.'
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.000]   Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.800]   many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying, 'Hallelujah!
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.640]   For the Lord God the Almighty reigns.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:34.040]   Let us rejoice and exult and give him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.400]   come and his bride has made herself ready.'"
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:47.280]   So, the hallelujah to God's glory will rise forever and ever, both for the mercy
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:56.080]   experienced at the Supper of the Lamb and for the judgment that falls upon those
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.680]   who have rejected that mercy and dishonored God in unbelief.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   So nothing I say or mean by the sentence, "God is most glorified in us when we are
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.200]   most satisfied in him," is intended to contradict any of that, but only affirm
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.400]   it.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.960]   Yeah, really profound text in Revelation.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   Hard truths, but vital to know if we are to understand God's will and works, and
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.320]   both his mercy and his wrath as displays of his glory.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.280]   Well, John Piper is a big advocate for seeing glimpses of the peculiar glory of
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.600]   Jesus in scripture, and those moments of discovery in his Bible are more than
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.560]   mere intellectual revelations.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.120]   Those discoveries are affectional, feeding his delight in God.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.240]   So the question then becomes, well, what does it feel like to see the beauty of
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.840]   Christ?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.240]   I don't think this question has ever come up in the podcast in the past, and I don't
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.400]   recall Pastor John ever addressing it either.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.120]   He will on Wednesday.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.040]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
