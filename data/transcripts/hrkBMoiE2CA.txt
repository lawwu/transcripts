[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Tell that guy to be quiet.
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.840]   - Hi, I'm here with my brother Alex.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.060]   Alex, can you just introduce yourself?
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.580]   - Yes, I'm Alexander Strauch,
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.180]   and I'm a good friend of Gary Kim,
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.700]   who's an amazing man, and he's got a tremendous product.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.660]   - Wow, and Alex, currently where are you serving at?
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.620]   - I'm at Littleton Bible Chapel in Littleton, Colorado.
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.580]   I've been there 54 years,
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.420]   and we have a marvelous congregation.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.860]   In 60 years, we've never had a split,
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.380]   and I think the reason is everyone's committed
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.140]   to the Jesus principles of humility,
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.260]   servanthood, brotherhood, and Christ-like love.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.540]   We're totally committed to that.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.020]   - And is it true?
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.100]   I heard there is an update to your book, Biblical Eldership.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.900]   - Yes, a complete update.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.580]   It's 35 years of age.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.780]   It needed to be updated.
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.900]   It's a textbook, and if you have a textbook,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.620]   you've gotta keep it up to date.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.840]   Plus, I've learned a lot over the years talking to people,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.860]   and so I think it's a much better book
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.700]   than what you have in your hands.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.900]   - Okay, and I just had a question, Alex,
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.980]   about Bible translations.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.740]   Why is it important to just have a good Bible translate?
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.140]   - Well, you know, in the English-speaking world,
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.020]   we have so many Bibles.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740]   It's actually gotten to the point of being ridiculous.
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.220]   A serious Bible student wants a serious Bible.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.580]   A serious Bible student wants a Bible
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.360]   that respects the original languages
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.360]   and wants to carry over the meaning of the original text.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   The problem with the many dynamic translations,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.160]   which has certain advantages,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.920]   is that they try to smooth out the Greek.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.800]   They try to put in words like friendship instead of saints,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.680]   which are very important words.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.800]   And here's a real problem, Gary.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.080]   Translations wanted to read nicely,
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   and so they remove the little words for, therefore.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.300]   In the Greek language, these are so important
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.980]   for development of thought.
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.660]   So I don't want a Bible that's gonna remove
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.700]   these important particles, transitional words.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.140]   I once asked Dr. S. Lewis Johnson,
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.020]   one of the great Greek scholars of America,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.900]   taught at Dallas Seminary many, many years.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.140]   I said to him, "Dr. Johnson, what do you want to tell
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.760]   "a young man like me starting out?"
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.260]   He said, "Look for those little particles,
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.320]   "those little transitional words.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.540]   "Then you learn to follow the logic of the apostles.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.360]   "You have an accurate translation."
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.760]   So that's the kind of Bible I want.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280]   - Oh, awesome, thank you.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.080]   And you know, Alex, you've been in ministry
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.040]   for many, many years.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   What kind of encouragement would you give believers today
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.560]   after all these years of ministry?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.320]   - I would say be in a good church,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   have good Christian friends.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840]   We're in a hostile environment
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.920]   that I have never seen in my lifetime.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.960]   The new secularism hates us,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.740]   wants to put us out of business.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.380]   Our children are in trouble.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.960]   You need good, solid churches, not sleepy churches,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   not churches trying to conform,
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   accommodate themselves to society,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.520]   and you need good Christian friends
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.600]   that together you're sharing the things of God,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.220]   upholding one another.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.880]   - Alex, thank you, brother.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.720]   I love you.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.560]   Thanks for being my friend.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   - Thank you, dear Gary.
