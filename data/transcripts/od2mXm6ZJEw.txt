[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   And the final piece of advice, I love that picture, okay,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   is to look up to the stars
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.400]   and appreciate every single moment you're alive
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.120]   at the mystery of this world, at the beauty of this world.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Again, this is my perspective, take it with a grain of salt,
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.240]   but I advise to forever oscillate
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.240]   between deep profound doubt and self-dissatisfaction
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.360]   and the deep gratitude for the moment,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.840]   for just being alive, for all the people around you
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.200]   that give you their love,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.280]   with whom you get to share those moments,
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.240]   you share the love.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   A poem by Stephen Crane
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.740]   that I especially like in the desert.
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.020]   In the desert, I saw a creature, a naked bestial,
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.520]   who squatting upon the ground,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.760]   held his heart in his hands and ate of it.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.580]   I said, "Is it good, friend?
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.920]   It is bitter, bitter," he answered.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.360]   "But I like it because it is bitter
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.040]   and because it is my heart."
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.080]   So I would say the bitter is the self-dissatisfaction,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.060]   that's the restless energy that drives us forward.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.360]   And then enjoying that bitterness and enjoying the moment
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.520]   and enjoying the sweetness that comes from
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.560]   eating your own heart in this poem
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   is a thing that makes life worthwhile.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.460]   And that is, to me, happiness.
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.900]   So with those silly few pieces of advice,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.120]   I'd like to continue on the gratitude and say thank you.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.400]   Thank you to my advisor.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.780]   Thank you to this university
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.640]   for giving me a helping hand, there you go.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.360]   And thank you to my family
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.080]   and all the friends that I've had along the way.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.160]   Thank you for their love.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.520]   (audience applauding)
