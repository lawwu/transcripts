[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.540]   - I love this question from a podcast listener
[00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.540]   named Lauren, "Pastor John, how can I make the most
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.340]   "of my Bible reading in the Old Testament books
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.020]   "that seem to have no obvious connection to Christ
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.740]   "and don't seem to have any application to my life?
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.620]   "I'm struggling to read through numbers right now.
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.420]   "I often wonder what God's purpose
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.280]   "in giving so much detail about the certain offerings
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.080]   "and festivals and laws.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.240]   "As I'm reading through books like this,
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.820]   "how and what can I learn
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820]   "in order to grow from these books?"
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.660]   - Well, Lauren, I am reading numbers right now also.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.740]   (both laughing)
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.660]   And I have felt some of your frustrations.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.100]   (both laughing)
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.780]   And my guess is that most of us have, if we're honest, right?
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.820]   And the answer to the problem has so many layers
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.700]   and so many parts and whole books could be written
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.700]   about the glories of Leviticus and Exodus and Deuteronomy
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.260]   and the parts of the Bible that we find confusing.
[00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.260]   But instead of even going into any of those layers
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.620]   of the usefulness of numbers,
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.580]   I wanna sow a seed in Lauren's mind
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.660]   that just might bear more fruit in this regard
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.580]   than the specifics of how one might profit
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.780]   from a particular Old Testament book.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.020]   We can come back to that later at another time
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.620]   if you want to, but this is what I have in my mind.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.260]   The main thought I wanna suggest is that the Bible,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.180]   with all of its many wonderful and strange parts,
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.820]   is designed by God, inspired by God, designed by God,
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.780]   put together by God,
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.900]   not just for 21st century Western middle-class culture,
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.220]   but for thousands of cultures around the world
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.460]   spread over thousands of years
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.340]   with all of those centuries and all of those cultures
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.380]   being dramatically different.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.820]   What a challenge.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.220]   What a challenge for God to put together a book
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.620]   that works like that.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.620]   If you were God, how would you create a book
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.420]   that would be useful in all the cultures of the world
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.780]   and all the centuries of the world?
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.180]   And make no mistake, Paul says,
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.660]   "All the scriptures are profitable for teaching
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.460]   so that the people of God may be equipped
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.460]   for every good work," and he didn't just mean me
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.100]   in my particular little cultural place and time.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.620]   He wasn't just referring to us.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.060]   So you can see what I'm suggesting.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.520]   It may be that the way the book of Numbers,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.340]   or some other part, is written
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.260]   is exactly what would capture the imagination
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.020]   of some other culture and time besides our own.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.180]   Here's the way John Owen,
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.940]   I'd snatched this quote out of the book that I just wrote.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.140]   I'm just loving thinking about
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.900]   how to read the Bible these days.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.820]   Here's what Owen said.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.180]   "In the writing and composing of the Holy Scripture,
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.980]   the Spirit of God had respect unto the various states
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.180]   and conditions of the church.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.100]   It was not given for the use of one age or season only,
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.440]   but for all generations, for a guide in faith and obedience
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.360]   from the beginning of the world to the end of it.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.820]   The principal end of the scripture
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.960]   is to beget in the minds of men faith, fear, obedience,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.540]   and reverence of God to make them holy and righteous.
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.540]   Unto this end, every truth is disposed of in the scripture
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.840]   as it ought to be.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.540]   In the depths and shallows of this river of God,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.540]   the lamb may wade, the elephant may swim."
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.780]   I can hardly picture John Owen talking about elephants,
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.200]   but there it is.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.400]   So the point is that we are not the only ones
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.240]   for whom God inspired the Bible.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.740]   There are thousands of cultures,
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.860]   thousands of years besides our own,
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.860]   and there are in each culture, lambs,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.560]   and in each culture, elephants.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.900]   In each of those cultures,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.880]   some who need the simplest things
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.760]   and some who need the challenge
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.780]   of the most complex structures,
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.180]   and God aims to glorify himself both ways.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.700]   So let me give you just one example that so helped me
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.960]   when I first heard it years ago.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   It's told by Lynette Oakes in the book "Hidden People,"
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.440]   how a remote New Guinea culture was brought back
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.660]   from the brink of extinction.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.820]   So this, she must be related.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.260]   I don't know what her relationship is,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.260]   but Des and Jenny Oakes went to a people group
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.940]   in Papua New Guinea, the Bainumarian people, in 1970,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.020]   and began to translate the Bible.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.060]   Little side note, this people only had 111 people.
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.820]   Devastated after some kind of disease from 3000,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.620]   they chose the smallest people group they could find
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.820]   to show that God cares for the least.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.860]   I was just blown away,
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.220]   and they devoted years and years of their lives
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   to putting the Bible into the Bainumarian language,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.780]   and there was this point in the translation process
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.380]   where the helper got very excited,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.020]   and it happened to be when they were translating
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.300]   the genealogy of the first 17 verses of Matthew,
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.300]   the genealogy of Jesus that takes the genealogy of Jesus
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.540]   back to Abraham, and he said,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.540]   "We must gather the leaders and read this to them tonight."
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.580]   And he didn't know why, Des didn't know why that was,
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.740]   but when they gathered together and they began to read it,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.820]   the place was stone silent.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.420]   They gathered around, they looked down on the piece of paper,
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.900]   and he was at first frightened,
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.900]   and then when they were done reading it,
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.460]   the leader said, "Why didn't you share this with us before?
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.620]   "No one bothers to write down
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.320]   "the ancestors of spirit beings.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.560]   "It's only real people who record their genealogies.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.900]   "Jesus must be a real person.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.480]   "Jesus must have been a real man on the earth.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.220]   "He's not just white man's magic.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.260]   "Then what the mission has taught us is real."
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.380]   Shivers went up and down my back.
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.220]   Like, duh, I mean, why have I read that, you know,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.060]   a hundred times and never thought,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.420]   there's gonna be a culture somewhere
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.700]   that's gonna hear this genealogy that I find so tedious
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.000]   and so irrelevant to my life and say,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.380]   "Whoa, he's real."
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.520]   So the point is that there are going to be parts
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.240]   of the Bible that I, as a 21st century,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   middle-class white guy, find difficult
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.440]   to find relevance in or any kind of echo
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.880]   of my own present concerns.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.000]   And I'm just saying that when that happens,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.520]   I don't think I should neglect any part of the Bible.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.920]   I think I should be patient and pursue it all.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.560]   But oh, to respect God's wisdom
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.880]   in what he's put in this book for the thousands
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.640]   of cultures and thousands of years.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.400]   What a great book we have.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.680]   What a wise book we have.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.160]   All the lambs, all the elephants going swimming here,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.620]   and it's gonna be perfect for somebody somewhere.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.920]   - Yes, that is a marvelous perspective.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.880]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.560]   And mentioned earlier was the book John Piper just wrote.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.400]   And we talked about that book in episode 837 on the podcast.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.040]   The episode is titled, "Sneak Peek of John's Next Book."
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.680]   And you can find it in the APJ app
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.360]   or the podcast archive at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.780]   Well, we Baptists believe water baptism is for those
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.000]   who can openly profess their faith in Christ.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.280]   So what is the relationship of our unbaptized children
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.400]   to the new covenant promises?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.680]   This is a question on the table tomorrow.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll see you then.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
