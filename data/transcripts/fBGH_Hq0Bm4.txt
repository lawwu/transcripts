[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   The legend I don't sing that lately the legend Michael Obitz is in the building arguably one of the most successful talent agents ever
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.900]   He rose from working in a mailroom to become a super agent representing some of Hollywood's biggest stars one doesn't
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.340]   Get to a place of success
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.700]   without having made mistakes
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.940]   People say all kinds of things about him really really all kinds of things about him
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.420]   We went out to win and when you go out to win you make certain sacrifices
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.320]   We were tough and we were aggressive and I had a philosophy of win at all costs when we did
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.680]   The cost was huge rise or fall
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.580]   On our own deeds our own brains our own willpower
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.420]   It's no crime and being vulnerable with people everybody has an issue
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.480]   I want to leave the planet a little better than when I came on please join us in welcoming Michael Obitz Wow
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.700]   Thank you so much
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.500]   Michael
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500]   All right, we have
[00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.420]   We have been trying to make this happen for three years. You're a hard one to get a hold of yeah
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.220]   If you don't know Michael
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.780]   You shouldn't be here
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.300]   Michael
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.260]   Co-founded CAA and his book is fantastic by the way. Yeah, who is Mike Ovitz?
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.620]   Yeah, it's such it's such a read you could just skim through it by like read right through it because it goes by so fast
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.540]   It's incredible in
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540]   1975 where
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.620]   You know, Michael is really known for transforming Hollywood and transforming the media business
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.180]   one of the big innovations of many in Michaels career has been the
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.180]   the innovation of packaging which really changed the power dynamics and the trajectory of
[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.820]   How content was made in Hollywood?
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.540]   Michael's had we were just talking about this kind of three careers
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.100]   Both as the founder of CAA and then later a partnership with Andy Grove in
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.820]   1993 where you formed the CAA
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.700]   Intel Media Lab and
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.140]   really tried to bring technology to Hollywood and then later joined up with Marc Andreessen and
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.780]   have helped Marc and Ben since then scale up Andreessen Horowitz and really change how Silicon Valley operates and
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.380]   It's just an incredible
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.580]   Reinvention story but one where it seems you've brought a similar sort of set of innovations in all three phases
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.940]   maybe you can tell us a little bit about those three major transitions and
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.060]   the you know, the the way that you kind of made the decision to kind of reinvent yourself and
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.620]   Bring technology and media together. Well, first of all
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.500]   Thank you for having me. I I'm honored to be here. I
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.320]   Must say I've been going up to the valley since
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.020]   1992
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.820]   Probably hard for most of you in the audience to believe this, but I'm much older than all the guys up here
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.060]   and
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060]   these are four of the
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.220]   not just the smartest but the
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.660]   most effective
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.900]   Men that I've met up in the valley with respect to what they do how they do it
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.700]   And then lastly I have tried since they started the all-in
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.620]   Podcasts I have applied 15 times to be a bestie
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.460]   And I have been rejected by one of the four up here which I will not say which one
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.340]   But we all want to have what they have and I was saying to David in the
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.300]   Backstage, it's so fantastic how they've set something up. That is so interesting to listen to to learn from
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.380]   Even to push up against you don't have to agree with it, which is what I like about it
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.540]   But to hear it from something we all want in our lives
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.060]   Which is close friends where you can say whatever you want as a matter of fact some of the stuff they say to David I find
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.060]   offensive, but
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.420]   So back to the question, um, I
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.380]   have an insatiable appetite for information and
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.540]   for
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.380]   Trying to stay up
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.620]   With things that are current I started in the entertainment business when I was 17 years old, believe it or not
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:36.460]   I was the first tour guide at Universal Studios. They had hired five men and five women and I
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.700]   really learned so much about
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.220]   the media business and and how
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.780]   They made entertainment
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:53.780]   Because Universal was in every area in film television music books everything and it's all the same by the way
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.700]   It's just different
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.780]   Iterations of it. It's all made to entertain people and I got the bug. I went to UCLA
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.580]   Took me three years to get out of there
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.260]   I couldn't get out of there fast enough, but I went to the first class and the last class
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.220]   that's why when I was here I got really scared because I
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.220]   Kind of missed the classes in between because I worked full-time at 20th Century Fox and just had a blast
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.540]   And then I went into the agency business in my early 20s. I was at Universal as a tour guide. I saw
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.260]   these men
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:40.340]   And women dressed really well being received well by everybody on the studio lots and I I said, well, that's interesting
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.100]   What do they do?
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.860]   I found out they were agents and I realized I could get a very wide education and I've always been interested in
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:55.540]   Making myself smarter about things because I'm not I don't have the gift that a couple of these guys up here do which is
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.500]   For all of them, which is raw intelligence. I've I've got
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.500]   Uneducated intelligence. I have to really work at it and I really enjoyed
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.060]   That time and and getting into it
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.180]   We broke off when I was 26 a bunch of us for a whole series of reasons from the William Morris ages
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.360]   He started CA with a very simple thesis
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.820]   which was that we were going to do something as a team rather than individually and
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.420]   It just worked really well artists enjoyed having a group of
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.300]   Individuals to talk to which is not dissimilar to what these four guys have accomplished
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:42.700]   Artists liked being surrounded by multiple people with different skill sets. So that worked really well
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.740]   in
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.740]   1992
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.100]   You could smell in LA
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.100]   Something going on up north but the thing about Los Angeles and the inner and particularly the entertainment
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.540]   Community is it's an incredibly
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.140]   Siloed community. They don't accept people very well from the outside
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.180]   Which by the way makes it very inbred and it's not particularly wise
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.340]   It may be smart for the moment, but it's not wise
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.640]   So I started going up to San Francisco to see what was going on up there and then in the middle of 92 I called
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.380]   cold Bill Gates and
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:32.500]   It wasn't the Microsoft of today. It was a small company and I went up and met with Bill and
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.060]   Then he introduced we talked for four hours
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.780]   about where
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.540]   My business and his business could converge and the only thing I will tell you is neither of us had any idea
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.740]   But it was the start of a discussion
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.940]   Bill introduced me to a man named Nathan Myrvold who I'm still friendly with today who was the first CTO of Microsoft and
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.340]   I was an advisor to
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:04.860]   Three of the four major record labels and I remember being at one of the music
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.260]   labels that had 25% market share and there were stereo speakers in there and Nathan had said to me I
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.860]   can't explain this to you, but
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.500]   Music's gonna come from up there. I had no idea what he was talking about and
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:28.660]   I advised all four companies that something was happening and that hard goods weren't gonna be able to be sold and
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.780]   I got fired by one of them. I
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.340]   Got thrown out by the other three. They thought that Nathan was crazy
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.300]   They didn't understand what Microsoft was and they had no interest in computers or anything
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.780]   Digital and then from there. I went and met Andy Grove. We started a dialogue and we brought
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.500]   Every conceivable piece of hardware and software
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.180]   Available to Los Angeles put it in our Beverly Hills building
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.540]   The top of the building had like eight dishes on it
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.540]   it looked like we were going to take off and
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:10.460]   We invited everyone from the entertainment business to come in and see and test all this
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.020]   To wrap this up
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.780]   It was a great thing and a sad thing
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.780]   We knew something was coming. We had no idea what
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.740]   but the business did what it always does it put its head in the sand and no one looked to San Francisco and
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.300]   Today when I meet with people in the business
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.940]   It's interesting when I explain to them how?
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:45.140]   Streaming has basically changed the legacy business forever, and it will never change again
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:51.140]   And it's all because everyone that we worked with refused to embrace
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   Change which to me is
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:10:00.100]   Sort of the mantra of my life. I want to change I've changed my life personally
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.620]   I've changed careers three different times
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:10.060]   It's all about learning and about pushing yourself and it wasn't just media because you were very early to helping
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.660]   Company like like Palantir as an example. It's not just hey Michael Ovitz is a Hollywood guy or a media guy
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:22.940]   You were an advisor to a pure tech company. Yeah, can you tell us a little bit about what you did with Palantir?
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.940]   And how you got involved in what role you played?
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.500]   so in 99 a
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.540]   Young man named Mark Andreessen who happened to have been on the cover of Time magazine
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.700]   Barefooted which I thought was really weird
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.660]   and
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.260]   He called me cold. I didn't know who he was frankly. I had heard of him
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.940]   I had heard of him because we were doing work for Jim Clark
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.620]   who Mark was in business with and
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.460]   He had a company that was very close to the media business at the time
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:00.540]   I guess you could say was a pre Adobe type business and I
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:07.380]   Met with Mark and I can't explain to you what happened, but we went to a lunch that was going to take an hour
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.820]   I'm not long on lunches
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.020]   I don't do one hour zoom and I hate long calls because you can't get anything done
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.420]   So I thought we were going to be an hour. We were four and a half hours and at the end of that
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:26.780]   He said well you come on the my board with Ben Horowitz. We're starting a company called loud cloud and
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.380]   I said explain it to me and he did and I had no clue what he was talking about. I
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.500]   Just didn't understand it
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:39.420]   He said all this data is going up in the sky and all I could think of was Nathan telling me that about music
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:46.420]   And I said well now two smart guys really smart guys a lot smarter than me are talking about what's going on up there
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.820]   So I went on Mark's board
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.380]   I'm still involved with them 25 years later and
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.780]   Mark basically
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.780]   introduced me to
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.700]   Everyone up in the valley Reid Hoffman Peter Thiel Mark Zuckerberg
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.220]   everybody that he dealt with and
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.400]   One of the guys he introduced me to was Peter Thiel who I just had dinner with last weekend is one of the smartest guys
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.860]   I've ever met and
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:21.020]   He put a ton of his own money into Palantir. He had no investors. He had a small investment from DARPA. I
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   Had no clue what they did, but he called me up. He said can you help me?
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.660]   because we are
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:35.500]   In business with the US government and they don't pay very well and that I could empathize with
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.260]   They they take a lot of money in tax, but they don't pay very well
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.860]   And I said, what do you want me to do? Because you know my
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.220]   coding
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.340]   is a bit limited and
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:56.080]   He said I want you to help get come up set up a commercial business. So without going through a long boring story
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.800]   After Peter got a dozen phone calls being criticized for bringing me in to do this
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.460]   Which he actually enjoyed by the way, which is what I love about him
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.840]   I met with Alex Karp for three months in his office
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.320]   I was living in San Francisco three days a week and I looked at everything they were doing
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.200]   they only had at the time about 25 30 engineers and
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.360]   Came up with some ideas
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.760]   starting with three silos
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.720]   narrowed it to advertising health care and finance
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:36.440]   got rid of the two of them quickly because finance was a no-brainer the whole world had gone under with the mortgage crisis and
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.040]   Palantir actually had an algorithm
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.640]   that you could plug an address of a house into it and they
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   did this after I asked them to you could plug an address of a house and it scraped a
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.160]   Million data points within one mile of the house how many kids were leaving private school?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.840]   how many hamburgers were sold how many dry cleaning stores closed it was like a
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.400]   brief in a nanosecond of the economy and
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.240]   JP Morgan
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.800]   couldn't offer mortgage for the life of them if they wanted to because
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:19.640]   They had local branch managers who loved their jobs. All the mortgages were underwater. They didn't want to make a decision
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.120]   We put Palantir online
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.020]   They got permission to plug the address in and whatever the bid-ask came up. They get close
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.480]   We promised we deliver in 90 days. I always over
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.120]   I always under promise and over deliver and
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:43.420]   We delivered in 55 days and we saved them a hundred and fifty million dollars to the bottom line in that
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.560]   55 day period and
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:52.160]   That became a request from them. The only problem they had is they forgot
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.560]   To make a deal with me
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.760]   for the software
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.920]   so they had this unbelievable result and no deal and
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.760]   They offered I think two million for a
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.000]   One-year license for five years and I called Peter and he was just dancing on his desk
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.440]   He couldn't believe it and I said I turned it down
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   so
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.080]   He said
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.600]   You've lost your mind and started yelling at me as only and in a nice way and I said just give me
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   15 days I used to be an agent and he said okay in any case 15 days later
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.240]   They came back and they made a deal that was
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:44.800]   many many multiples of that price and they became the first of the commercial business at Palantir and then
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   And now today their business
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:54.200]   As it was just added to the S&P sorry, they were just that yesterday and they 60/40 I'd say commercial versus
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.460]   Government government Michael. Can we talk a little bit about the movie business the entertainment business?
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.000]   We were just watching all this generative AI and I got the sense you were looking at it
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.200]   With either anger contempt or sadness
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.880]   You've made such amazing or you know, it orchestrates such amazing seminal works
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.680]   During peak cinema something Friedberg Sachs and I grew up in
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.400]   Defined, you know a lot of the way we look at art and now it feels like it's lost in many ways
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.000]   I'm curious when you see people making things with generative AI
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.920]   What happens to your heart and to your mind?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.280]   It's a great question Jason and I'll tell you why first of all
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.160]   Streaming is basically destroyed the legacy business. You've probably all seen in the press
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:50.080]   What's going on with Paramount where the Ellison's have purchased the company at a price?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.040]   That's probably 20% of what it used to be
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.720]   It was one of the great seven horsemen of the entertainment business business
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.840]   I was talking to David about and Jason earlier
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.880]   There's the entertainment business went from a you get paid upfront and then you get a piece of the profits
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   So since streamings come you get paid up front
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There are no profits your products in the ether your books in the ether your songs in the ether
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.280]   Music is a little better because thanks to Daniel Eck. Everybody gets a royalty, but it's very different than it used to be
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.960]   So streaming has destroyed
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:33.640]   The business that I grew up and it's why I wanted to get out of the entertainment business. You could see it coming
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.040]   secondly, I
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.480]   Think that the if you look past that and you look to AI right now
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.280]   It's bittersweet
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.640]   The things that can be done are mind-boggling. We just saw a slight example
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.240]   I'm involved with a company out of Germany with three
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:03.040]   Young PhDs from the University of Heidelberg. They have just released their first product
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.680]   Of text-to-video. I've never seen anything like this in my life
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.880]   visually
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   You can say what you want and it shows up and I mean, it's perfect
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.720]   The technology is staggering and I've seen every one of them for obvious reasons
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.240]   the people that work in this community and
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:32.760]   250,000 people in Los Angeles make their living in the media business
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   They are all afraid of one thing and that is are they going to have a job or be able to work?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.300]   So if you talk to a production designer
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.880]   the man or woman
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   who comes up and draws and designs every shot so they can light it and figure out continuity and
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.960]   Who's wearing what and what they're gonna shoot so they can get their two minutes of film in?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   12 hours because that's what you get you work to 12 hours a day. You get two minutes of usable footage. I
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:14.720]   Am working on a project right now with Netflix and a production designer I am
