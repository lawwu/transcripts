[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160]   what did your doctor give you to make you lose all this weight what is your celebrity doctor
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.480]   giving you tell the truth do you get that new shot people people on twitter are like your
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.040]   your twitter account sounding a lot more like jay count and i'm like i think we're on the same diet
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:23.200]   i think that's what's going on here in three two let your winners ride brain man david sacks
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600]   and instead we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.640]   hey everybody hey everybody welcome to another episode of the all in
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.320]   pod with us today of course the queen of quinoa and from his castle in italy the cackling
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.200]   uh dictator chamath palihapitiya nice gardenias and back from his big
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.600]   big battle his brawl unblocked and undefeated the rain man himself david sacks and judging by
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.400]   the comments uh i'd say dominant oh you read the comments just another sign of your obsession with
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.520]   how you proceed don't like don't even i never read comments don't rule number one don't read
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.040]   the comments we're not doing it again it shows because you're not listening to the comments so
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.720]   it makes sense oh okay go ahead and you got your whole troll army how many people have you hired on
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.760]   your social media team to troll me from anonymous accounts on twitter now to prove your points
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.800]   now you're paranoid too all right i'm not gonna don't be paranoid don't be paranoid anyway look
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   we've patched things up don't break the peace we have detente all right so freeburg is busy uh
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:54.000]   writing tweet storms now um about the drought in california which seems to be uh just gonna be a
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.640]   really bad year basically so freeburg walk us through it how bad is california's drought going
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.600]   to be this year so the drought is already very bad um i put out a lot of tweets at two in the
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280]   morning last night i think i drank way too much caffeine yesterday i'm in the mountains and like
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.640]   the only way i can avoid having headaches is like drinking caffeine all day and it
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.680]   was a mistake it kept me up all night you're sure it's not fair
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.280]   maybe you're so excited about this that you just can't sleep when you're up into needles
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.120]   nick you could beat this out nick you gotta be no no keep that keep that so
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.280]   you know the the big tweet storm i put out at two in the morning last night kind of highlighted that
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.880]   there was a paper published in 2018 2019 that showed how you know north america particularly
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.360]   the western half of north america is in this you know mega drought that we haven't seen in
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   you know 500 plus years and since that paper was published you know um in 2019 conditions
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.200]   have only worsened we talked about this a few pods ago but like the snowpack level in california
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.160]   reached zero percent throughout the entire state by june 1st that has never happened before
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.360]   temperatures in british columbia as you guys know reached over 120 degrees for several days
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.320]   in a row last week which has never been seen in history in british columbia um you know there was
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.120]   a paper published today that estimates that over a billion um animals and life forms were wiped
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.240]   out in the coastal region of british columbia because of this heat wave
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   um and the temperatures in in california are obviously excessive as well not as bad as they
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   were last year but what matters most is that the moisture conditions in our forest land is lower
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.920]   than we've ever seen at this time of year in history and so this all sets us up and and the
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.160]   other kind of big consequence the high temperatures is causing an increased demand for air conditioners
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.120]   that's the big variable in power demand on all grids and the low snowpack means that we're not
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   getting hydroelectric power hydroelectric power is down by 70 percent in the state of california
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.000]   over where we were in 2019 because there's no snow that's melting causing the rivers to flow
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.160]   and about 11 to 15 percent of our state's electricity comes from hydroelectric power
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.360]   so we're going to have more power demand we have less power available we have extremely dry forests
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.600]   and so this is setting us up for a number of possible disasters this year and so rather than
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.880]   just trying to sound the alarm bells what i'm pointing out is that there may be some things that
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.600]   we should be thinking about doing to try and get ahead of some of the consequences of these big
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.640]   risks like
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   you know having enough masks for people to breathe outside so we don't have to shut down schools and
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.960]   shut down outdoor work and all the things that might happen having community centers that have
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.320]   power available the state is scrambling to find excess power on the grid right now but um you know
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.480]   it just highlights that there's a moment here that is almost like where we were going into covid
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.520]   it may not happen but the probability is high enough that something bad may happen that we
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.920]   should probably start to get prepared for it you know we should probably be talking about
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   the things we're doing to get prepared for it and we're talking about and we should be
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.040]   talking about the things we're going to do to make sure that communities are safe and people
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   are safe and businesses can keep operating because if the state of california has 150 aqi which is the
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.760]   air quality index workers can't work outside and all the outdoor work which employs three million
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.200]   californians has to shut down and you know you kind of start to add these things up it's like
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.600]   what are we going to do as this happens not if this happens and we should kind of be planning for it
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.880]   and i don't see much happening in terms of planning and and preparation and talking about
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   the opportunity history rhymes because if you remember uh
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.920]   and this is all going into a recall election in the fall uh this was a different but kind
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.720]   of equivalent setup where you guys remember we were having all these blackouts and brownouts
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.160]   when uh gray davis was recalled and then schwarzenegger just swooped up out of nowhere and
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.640]   you know people thought oh there's no chance and people were just frustrated because the
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.800]   quality of life took a measurable step backwards uh in the intervening six or nine months before
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.160]   the recall election and so it'll be really interesting to see how gavin
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.040]   newsom manages all of this because if he can't get the state's act together and
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:06.240]   you have all of these issues at hand and a credible candidate emerges um you could have
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.400]   some really interesting political fireworks in september a big part of this correct me if i'm
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.160]   wrong friedberg is that we live in essentially like a lot of desert area here in california and
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.000]   we just haven't invested in the desalinization plants we have one that's come on since 2005
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.560]   and i think there's another one in socal that was mothballed and they during the last drought
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   wanted to open it up again but we now have one in carlsbad the uh claude budd louis carlsbad
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.920]   desalinization plant that is now i think that cost us a billion bucks but israel correct me if i'm
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.360]   wrong is now they charge three times as much for water than we do so people take water seriously
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.600]   and they actually monitor their water usage and they have desalinization and they have more water
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.320]   than they need per capita well desal doesn't really solve a number of these problems that
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.200]   i'm highlighting you know the probability of the the forest land on the west coast not just in
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.440]   california but all up and down the west coast catching on fire is very high no number of desal
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.760]   plants is going to put out those fires when that happens the air quality is going to get really bad
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.520]   you know like we saw last year i don't know you guys remember i escaped to lake michigan last
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:21.680]   summer when the threads yeah yeah and it was um it was insane you know it doesn't desal plants don't
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.000]   solve the air quality problem where people can't work outside your kids can't go to school etc etc
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.520]   desal plants don't solve the problem of hydroelectric plants which requires snowpack
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.160]   to melt to get rivers to run to turn those turbines to generate electricity for the state
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.440]   nuclear would solve that though nuclear would solve that certainly and so you know the point is
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.640]   we're kind of reaching this apex of are we going to do climate change adaptation are we going to
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.320]   have um you know kind of long-term systemic solutions that we're going to start to put in
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   place for these risks that we face
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.880]   and more importantly from an acute perspective in the near term what are the actions we should be
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   taking to protect communities and get ahead of this problem so it's not a scramble after the crisis
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.080]   which is what we typically do with these sorts of crises we're not investing in infrastructure
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.280]   if we put in some nuclear power plants if we did more desal and we did more forest management or
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.480]   put more fire breaks into you know all this i'm talking about the simple solutions like
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.360]   i have a community three things would be massive wouldn't they well those are long-term solutions i'm
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.600]   talking about like for this summer oh this summer is it even solvable we need we need communities
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   no but we need to prepare for what is going to happen this summer so when communities get run out
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.680]   what are we going to do you know do we have community centers set up where people can get
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   water and power do we have masks available so that outdoor workers can keep working in the state
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.920]   you know all of these things that we could be doing to get in front of the inevitable consequences
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.840]   of these risks i think are things that we should be actively if you're in california
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.200]   you should order your air purifiers now we ordered six
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.320]   more of these conway ones that we used last year that were amazing get n95 masks
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.000]   we have the n95 masks we ordered them already and we're going to put in a power generator which i
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.840]   know not everybody is able to do but you can buy a portable one for as little as 300 or 400 bucks i
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.400]   think now so a portable generator in case you lose power stock up on everything else we need those
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.640]   solutions like i think there's going to be a big kind of power generator push right like distributed
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.480]   power has always been something that's the whole point of solar you get solar on your roof you get
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.040]   your own power
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.440]   um but how are you going to keep your ac running when it's 120 degrees outside if you have no power
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.440]   you know that that's kind of a very scary um circumstance of heat waves uh and it's um it's
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.520]   something that we should have a real plan around and if i were the governor or if i were kind of
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.000]   california leadership or leadership up and down the west coast you know the western governors
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.400]   um i'd probably be running a daily press conference starting now saying let's just
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.360]   get in front of this problem and talk about what are the risks we're seeing what are the problems
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.880]   we're seeing and what we're doing about it just so people feel reassured because you know square
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.040]   scrambling after a crisis doesn't make anyone feel better you know showing that we're prepared
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.840]   and we're taking action to get in front of this crisis which is not 100 certain but it's a greater
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.160]   than zero percent probability is something that could helpfully kind of reassure and start to put
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.680]   the pieces in place um for the near term by the way just just for those that don't really appreciate
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.800]   how interconnected everything is the basics the science basics on drought as i learned about them
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.720]   were really really incredible so you think okay well how how is all this stuff connected it turns
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.280]   out that you know as we have warmer and warmer temperatures yeah i didn't know this freebreak
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.680]   you probably do this but it accelerates soil evaporation and then there's this really terrible
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.640]   feedback loop that starts which is you have drier soil which means you have less vegetation
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.240]   and then as a result you have less what's called evapotranspiration which means there's less
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   regional precipitation and then this whole thing just starts to spin and spin and spin
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.560]   you have warmer temperatures that results in less snowpack the snow plaque the snowpack melts earlier
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.040]   and we have a situation now in the united states which is just incredible i saw a graph which is
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   uh one of soil moisture and it shows basically the western half of the united states is in the first
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:10.560]   percentile of soil moisture looking back over many many decades so well and then all of that
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   vegetation dries up and then we're in a position fodder for more fires no jason we're well even
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.400]   worse than this we're in a position where you know we are threatening our own food supply
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.680]   and just just just to put a a finer point on this it's not just the western half of the united states
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.360]   that's now suffering from this it's brazil it's the mediterranean and southern europe and its large
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   parts of africa you add up all those number of people there are many countries there that are
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.760]   actually self-sufficient which will then no longer be we'll have to import food that food quality is
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.040]   you know questionable at best in some cases so we're in a really tough position here and so it's
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.240]   isn't this all solvable
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.320]   with technology i mean if we just tax people a little more for the water usage if we really
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.480]   invested in the desal plants if we really invested in nuclear we could actually flip this whole thing
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.960]   the same way it's spiraling in the wrong direction it could spiral in the right direction two things
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.600]   on the water side i've been looking at water investing for a while there's a there's a real
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.000]   problem which is you know when i when i looked at this uh my team found some incredibly interesting
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.720]   opportunities largely it it evolves around owning water rights right and then basically selling them
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.080]   back to the state and when
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.680]   states get in difficult situations the problem is i think it's politically intolerable for
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.160]   let's just say somebody like me um to own those kinds of water to be a water baron yeah i think
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.400]   i think it's i think it's no bueno the the idea then that i had was like well maybe what we should
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.480]   be doing is buying these things and sticking them in a foundation so that we can guarantee water
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.720]   for people in certain states maybe that flies i'm not so sure that's the government's job
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.920]   that's the government's job and but then they're not doing their job but they're incompetent
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.360]   they're not doing their job but they're not doing their job but they're not doing their job but they're
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.320]   unfortunately not uh not as skilled as you'd want them to be on the stocks how would you spin this
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.960]   uh out of this death spiral and into abundance is there a way well i mean the the first thing
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.320]   to realize here is that this is not a black swan event i mean this is entirely foreseeable
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:15.760]   um drought conditions have existed in california for a long time in fact 200 years yeah well and
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.760]   even maybe going back millions of years i mean geologists have found evidence
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:26.800]   that you know millions of years ago you would have millions of acres of california burning every year
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:33.440]   and so drought conditions have existed for a long time uh has climate change amplified that and made
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   it worse yes but this is entirely foreseeable we know we're dealing with these conditions
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.880]   and in fact back on his first day in office in 2019
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.600]   newsom held his very first press conference about this issue on emergency preparedness for fires
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.800]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.080]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.360]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.560]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.440]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.480]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.440]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.320]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.440]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   and he said that he was going to be the first person to be on the call for fire
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.160]   this recall is supposed to happen in the october november time frame
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.800]   they've moved it up to september because newsom thinks there's a higher chance of fading
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.320]   the worst of fire season by doing the election sooner the problem for him
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.800]   is that fire season now starts in august and so we could be in the middle of fire season
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.480]   when this recall election happens and this thing could boomerang on him but back to the point about
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.800]   you know newsom held this press conference back in in january of 2019
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.280]   and the problem is there hasn't been any real fall through on
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.720]   forest management so you know newsom was recently caught in a lie
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:58.800]   saying that you know they had basically treated 90 000 acres this is what this article i'll put
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.880]   in the chat said in reality that only really treated about 11 000 acres even 90 000 would
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.080]   be inadequate right they're not doing enough and the way um you know i talked to a very
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   prominent person who knows california politics well and knows all the players
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.120]   and what he said is look the fundamental problem is that gavin is not operational right he's
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.000]   fantastic at fundraising he says all the right things at press conferences but but not everything
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.880]   is about running for re-election and the problem is he has not managed to this outcome and and so
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.440]   now we're in the situation where to freebrook's point we're going to be scrambling after the fact
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.840]   now what is newsom's excuse going to be it's going to be you know climate change can be global warming
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.240]   it's kind of the all-purpose dog ate my homework excuse for anything that goes wrong is he can just
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.200]   blame it on climate change but the reality is we knew about climate change climate change
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.640]   something we're going to have to live with even if we stop it in its tracks from this point forward
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.240]   we're not going to be able to reverse the effects it's already had and so we need leaders who will
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.440]   step up and and get much more aggressive about preventing this problem i think my
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.880]   and by the way my tweet i didn't mention climate change at all i got you know i
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.600]   don't think that that's even the point the point is we are facing acute conditions on the
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.640]   in the western half of the united states right now that lead to a number of significant and severe
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.360]   consequences those acute conditions you know you could blame them on climate change and say that
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.520]   they're part of climate change it doesn't change the reality they are here today and we have to
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.280]   deal with them um and i think yeah we have a we have a couple of things that are that are
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.480]   uh going to happen here in short order that i think can make this thing
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:47.920]   accelerated a little so there's a an organization a department in the united states government
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.000]   that's not very well known called the u.s bureau of reclamation usbr and they are the ones that
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.720]   will make formal assessments of water levels and there's a really important assessment that's going
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.640]   to happen in lake mead at the end of this year and the reason why it's critical is that if the
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.040]   u.s bureau of reclamation measures lake mead under
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:17.760]   a certain threshold they can declare a tier one shortage and what that means just practically
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.520]   as a whole is that if the state of mead is not going to be able to deal with water levels that's
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.840]   going to be a huge challenge for us and so what we're going to do is we're going to start to deal
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:35.280]   with these sort of like rolling i don't know what we're even going to call these water out scenarios
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.760]   where uh it's not just about watering your lawn that's not going to be possible it's going to be a
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   whole bunch of other things now there is a solution in the water level system but it's not going to be
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.600]   a solution that's going to be possible in the water level system as well and i think that's
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.640]   the most important thing that we're going to do and that's why we're going to start with the water
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.520]   level system because we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.440]   with the water level system because it's going to be a huge challenge for us to deal with and so if
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.000]   we start with the water level system we're going to start with the water level system and then we're
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.120]   going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.760]   then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.680]   water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.160]   start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system and then
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.080]   we're going to start with the water level system and then we're going to start with the water level system
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.580]   the aquifer to deliver drinking water to folks that are lacking
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   water. And this has been a multi year, you know, bordering on
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.220]   multi decades slog because of California politicians, because
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:33.200]   water has become highly politicised, no one wants to pay
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.960]   the full cost for a commodity that they frankly view is a
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.500]   right, but then they don't want to step in to do the work to
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.760]   actually make it reasonable and viable. So this whole thing is
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   just again, as David, as you said, the dog ate my homework.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.260]   And now we're really playing with some very complicated
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.280]   things that are really out of the control and intellectual
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   capacity of the frankly state governments, which is the
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.640]   interconnectedness of weather, temperature, water or soil or
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.960]   food supply. It's a I think what's so frustrating. This is
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.540]   this is so easily solvable. And we are not doing the blocking and
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.260]   tackling the free throws the basic things.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.260]   David Wright: Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's a really
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.260]   important point. And I think that's a really important point.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.260]   Because if you look at just monitoring our water usage, I
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.260]   invested in two companies, one of them didn't work out. But both
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   of them were to monitor water usage. And what we learned was
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.260]   at a campus like Stanford, they have like four water meters,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.720]   like they're not going down to the building level, in some
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.480]   cases, they'll be like four buildings on one water meter.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.140]   And you can very easily at each sink, at each, you know,
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.060]   put a device that cost 25 bucks installed, it just wraps around
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.140]   the the water, the pipe, and it could tell you how it's flowing.
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.740]   And we lose 2030% of our water to leaks. Nobody is monitoring
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.580]   their usage because there is no cost to it to schmutz point. And
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.120]   then you look at these crazy insane, almond and other
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.360]   agriculture in the middle of California. They are using flood
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.020]   irrigation, which
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.080]   I'm sure Friedberg can give us an education at versus what you
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.780]   know, the trip irrigation that they use and other reclaiming
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.040]   methods in Israel and other places. So we look at water as
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.980]   like, to Schmutz point, some crazy, God given right that we
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.240]   can just splash it everywhere, we can take 20 minute showers.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.560]   And then we allow how crazy is this, we allow the bottling of
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.440]   water in California, we allow these companies to bottle water
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.140]   and then sell it. And we don't even monitor usage we have well,
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.900]   new. So entitled, it
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.860]   is gross.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.720]   Newson's biggest donors, who's that family that grows all the
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.780]   almonds or whatever?
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.140]   Whoever they are the resnick's the resnick's single biggest
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.820]   don't them and the teachers union signals.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.000]   Oh, Linda Resnick and those palm people with the palm stuff.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.380]   It's total political corruption, right? I mean, they get
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.700]   Chinatown. It's literally the movie Chinatown.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.640]   Yeah. Well, I think so to this point about why aren't
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.340]   politicians solving the problems? I mean, to make a meta point,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.860]   there's a great tweet from Thomas soul or the person who manages
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.640]   the Thomas soul.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:08.780]   Account.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.300]   Where he said no one will really understand politics until they
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.060]   understand that politicians are not trying to solve our problems.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.020]   They're trying to solve their own problems.
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.560]   Which are getting elected and reelected. That's number one,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.320]   number two in office. That is their only goal three is far
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.380]   behind. And that's basically the situation we have is, I think
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.440]   Newsom actually is a little bit like Trump, not in his personal
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.500]   style, but in that he thinks he can talk his way out of
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.660]   problems. And he's not going to focus on solving a problem. And
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.340]   he's not going to focus on solving a problem when he can just
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.340]   spin his way out of it.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.300]   By the way, I just think you guys should know the you know,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.880]   because a lot of people talk about residential water use,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.180]   that is also kind of an acute and local problem, where
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.300]   depending on your water supply, how much water you have
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.020]   available to your community. But in terms of aggregate water
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.020]   use, the vast majority of water in California is used in
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:06.560]   agriculture. It's about 10x, what is used for residential
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.820]   applications.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.880]   So it's a huge part of our agriculture. By the way, it's not
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.420]   a bad thing. It's a huge part of our economy, that water has
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.940]   generally been fully available in aquifers, people bought that
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.160]   land with rights, they paid a premium for those rights to
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.400]   those aquifers. This is a very complicated problem in
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.740]   California. And that, you know, supports a large part of the
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.560]   California economy. So you know, you can't just kind of blow them
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.500]   away. But 90% of water use in California is associated with
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   AG. And it's not just a generally we need to save water
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.040]   problem. It's very specific to a region and a community and their
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.420]   particular water source on
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.360]   the water. So it's a very complicated problem. And it's a
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.680]   very complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.640]   And it's a very complicated problem. And it's a very
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.120]   complicated problem. And it's a very complicated problem. And
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.200]   so it's a little bit more complicated. But yeah, but we
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.600]   should be focused on abundance freeberg. If you look at the
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.660]   new nuclear power plants that you know, Bill Gates has invested
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.060]   in, and then you look at desalinization, which is an
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.260]   energy issue. We can desalinize for roughly two or three times
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.720]   the cost that we're getting water for now. So just put a
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.860]   nuclear power plant next to a desalinization plant and you're
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.460]   done.
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.300]   Great. That's a 20 year project. And you got to why Why is it a
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.840]   20 year project? China does it into you got to be more bold in
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.620]   this country. It is completely ridiculous that we accept that
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.740]   everything has to take 20 years. We need this now. Where's the
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   leadership that says, fuck it, let's do it immediately. Let's
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.060]   set a goal of two years to build 10 of these. Fucking money.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.300]   I'm not sure it solves our acute problems. It solves long term
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.460]   problems associated with climate change and energy.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.400]   We can't do both. Let's do both.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.180]   Sure, we should do everything. But right now, the you know,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.760]   the conditions indicate that there are some specific things
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.220]   that we can and should be doing to kind of support the state in
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.560]   terms of what's going to happen in the next year or two. And
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.380]   yes, we should also be funding long term projects that create
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.600]   water security and energy security for everyone in the
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.120]   United States. But SACS to your point, and by the way, if you
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.220]   guys ever want to read an interesting book about how the
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.940]   grid operates, there's a book called the grid. And it talks
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.700]   about how the electrical power grid system was built in the
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.500]   United States and how inefficient it is and all the
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.960]   problems. There are a lot of structural problems that need
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.060]   to be solved. Not just, you know, dropping and cheaply.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.240]   Cheap power. SACS, who is the good operational candidate that
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.220]   you've seen that's running for governor of California in this
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.740]   recall? Is there someone that stands out in your mind? Because
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.320]   I don't seem to hear anyone talking about, hey, there's a
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.840]   good alternative to Gavin Newsom at this point.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.440]   Yeah, I mean, we don't a clear alternative has not emerged yet.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.580]   You know, I guess the end part of the problem is that because
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.360]   there was no Republican primary, you haven't sort of consolidated
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.620]   the opposition to a leading candidate. There are a couple of,
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.940]   I guess, interesting
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.120]   candidates on the Republican side, I need to spend more time
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.600]   getting to, you know, know them. I mean, I have never met them or
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.780]   talk to them. But the two who are I think, mentioned quite a
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.380]   bit are this guy, Falconer, who's the mayor of San Diego,
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:57.860]   who is sort of a socially liberal Republican. And then
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:04.640]   there's a state assemblyman named Kevin Kiley, who, who I
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.820]   think says a lot of interesting things. And he just announced
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.020]   he's running. There's another guy as well, John Cox, but he got
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.540]   trounced by Newsom in the last election, I think it's time to
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.780]   let somebody else take a shot against him. And then of course,
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.880]   you've got Caitlyn Jenner, but I think people are still trying to
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.960]   figure out if her campaign is real or how real it is. So yeah,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:29.180]   look, we the opposition has not consolidated against Newsom, the
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.240]   way it did with Schwarzenegger, you know, back in 2001.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.460]   I'm voting. I'm voting Republican,
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.580]   just to create a counterbalance. I don't care who it is. And I'm
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.280]   not a Republican. I'm an independent. But I'm voting
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.040]   across the board. I'm just going to go to Republican for every
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.100]   position in California. And I'm going to just run my finger down
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.840]   the line. How does it feel to be a radical Trump supporter?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.400]   I listen, I am not for Trump. But Chamath, talk to us about
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.560]   nuclear and what we can do to get to reverse with these hippie
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.200]   dippy well intentioned no nukes concert set us back 50 years.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.460]   And let's be honest, we're going to have to do a lot of work.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.020]   And I'm going to be honest, a lot of the climate change
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.600]   problems we have today we would not have if we had invested in
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.920]   nuclear Yeah, I said, Well, I sent her on an image, Nick,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.560]   maybe you can stick it in the show notes or something so that
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.740]   people can see but if you if you look at if you graph the
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.720]   construction of nuclear reactors from the great 60s 1960s to
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.620]   today, essentially what and you color code them by country, what
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:36.380]   essentially you see is a transition from the able from
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.340]   the frankly, from countries that are not nuclear reactors, from
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.820]   countries that are not nuclear reactors, from countries that
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.480]   basically were just right at the leading the pack, and it was
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.600]   really the United States, building building building, and
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.960]   then two things really happened. There was Three Mile Island, and
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.400]   then there was Chernobyl. And there was an incredible over
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.660]   reaction to not really understanding either the cause,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:02.240]   and or the remediation to two events. Now, could you imagine
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.020]   if there were two airlines that crashed and we stopped flying?
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.240]   How basically we would have, you know, retarded the progress of
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.160]   the world. And now you impose it on something like nuclear energy,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.240]   which is consistently proven to provide an enormous, the
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.640]   abundant, cheap, and clean form of sustainable energy. And it
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.800]   actually solves a bunch of the problems we talked about before.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.680]   So for example, if you look at the power consumption for
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.440]   desalination, it's off the charts, quite honestly, okay,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.860]   that's why people say that it can't be done credibly. If you
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.100]   look at even nuclear power consumption, it's off the charts, quite honestly. Okay, that's why people say that it can't be done credibly. If you look at
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.500]   in just like the amount of energy that's required to clean water and to, you know,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.940]   sanitize water and make it drinkable, the, the standards that are defined by the government
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.020]   are incredibly stringent, but the implication of it operationally is an enormous amount
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.140]   of power that goes into it.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:58.220]   But Jason, you are right, which is that if we have small forms of sustainable abundant
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.100]   energy that can be basically hyper localized and located where we can do these jobs, the
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.340]   jobs to be done, it's transformational.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.020]   Now, why doesn't it happen?
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.740]   It doesn't happen because the same folks who really want to sound the alarm bells on climate
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.340]   change, which is the progressive left are not really willing.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.940]   They're intellectually lazy when it comes to nuclear, they don't do the work.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:25.260]   They make a brand sort of broad based prognostication about how we need to do something
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.900]   about climate.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:31.580]   Then they will point to solar and wind without really understanding the contamination of
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.980]   the earth that we do in order to mine.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.180]   The.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.780]   Rare earths and the actual metal and mineral inputs that are required for solar.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.500]   It's nuts, but it sounds better, right?
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.620]   It sounds better.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.500]   It sounds better.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:45.980]   It's better optics.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.660]   Oh, we're using air and the sun.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.740]   The sun and it's abundant.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:56.220]   And it's like, if I could show you what, what tailings are and like the dirty after effects
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.940]   of mining copper and nickel out of the ground, which is what we need for batteries and how
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.020]   countries like Indonesia are literally dumping it into the ocean.
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.140]   Dumping it faster that they can get their hands on it so that they can sell copper and nickel
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.980]   and cobalt to us so that we can make batteries.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.100]   You would actually say to yourself, if you knew all these facts, you'd actually say to yourself,
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.340]   you know what?
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.540]   Maybe nuclear isn't so bad.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.220]   And maybe I overreacted to two incidents.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.580]   You want to understand this.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:26.780]   You just have to look at the laziest group of individuals and society.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.340]   The French, they want to take the laziest route and do the least amount of work and
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.620]   have the most amount of leisure.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.820]   Sorry to our French listeners.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:34.860]   70%.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.660]   70% of the energy in France is from nuclear.
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.180]   They figured this out.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:46.860]   They said, how do we take more time off and not work and have unlimited electric 70% nuclear.
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.140]   They're so smart.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.180]   Well, the French are actually smart because after they're smart, because after Fukushima,
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.700]   what happened is if you had, you know, sort of like woke politicians, Germany, a bunch
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.700]   of Germany, they completely unwound their entire nuclear agenda, which was down, which
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.780]   was insanity, insanity.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.780]   And so now here they are, they're writing laws faster than they can make them up.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:17.180]   They're basically pivoting entire industries to try to now adopt batteries and storage
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.820]   without any real understanding about the downstream implications to the earth that they are going
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.620]   to create.
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.860]   The net consequences.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.580]   If they had just stayed the course on nuclear, they would be in a much better place.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.820]   And to France's credit, they were like, what the fuck are you people overreacting about?
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.540]   Again, you know, I'm not saying that.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.660]   I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:35.980]   They're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:35.980]   I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:36.060]   I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:36.460]   I'm saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:36.700]   I'm not saying that they're going to make a big impact on the future.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.580]   So, again, just think about this, guys.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:37.660]   The pragmatism is delightful.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:42.300]   If we stopped flying after two airline crashes, where would the world be?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.860]   Where would the world be?
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.300]   I mean, be pragmatists here.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:53.100]   Do we want to deal with high energy prices and brownouts and all kinds of problems and
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.420]   rolling blackouts or do we want to put this issue behind us?
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:04.620]   If we just go on a Manhattan Project literally to make new nuclear, we would be, this issue would
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.060]   be behind us and we could focus on something else like education.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.580]   It's so dumb.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.780]   The very scary thing about nuclear is despite all of the progress,
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:18.540]   it will get bogged down in litigation and bureaucracy.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.540]   These are the last two things that should be in front of science and physics,
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.380]   especially when it comes to energy independence.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.820]   I just think it's crazy.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.460]   Can you break any way out?
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:34.620]   Any way we can get people to, what's the best way to convince the American public to embrace
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.820]   nuclear and force our politicians to do it?
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.820]   Open your mind and think for yourself.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.540]   Right.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.540]   Please read a book.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.300]   Mark Andreessen had a good term.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.900]   He said we're living in a "Vetocracy" as in the word veto.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:54.060]   I think it was an interesting interview with Antonio Garcia Martinez on his blog.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.660]   Anyway, yeah, they were talking about the inability of the US to build anything
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.700]   anymore, especially when you compare us to some place like China.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:06.780]   And whether you want to call it NIMBYism or VETOCRACY, there are just too many people and
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:12.220]   groups who have the right to say no to anything and block anything important from happening.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.700]   But we got to stop letting our politicians off the hook by making excuses.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:24.380]   Just because there's climate change doesn't mean that the politicians can't do anything about it.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.500]   I mean, welcome to the downstream consequences of a
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.420]   successful democracy, right?
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.500]   Like a democracy over time doesn't reduce the number of laws it has.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.860]   Every year, politicians need to do their job and they create new laws.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.740]   As new laws accumulate, like the things get clogged up, right?
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.980]   Like, when have you seen a law that gets passed by a local government,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.820]   a state government or federal government that makes it easier to do something?
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.300]   I get that.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.380]   But where does it say in the Constitution of the United States that being part of a
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.980]   democracy also means shutting your brain off and becoming a dumb cynic?
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.340]   That's so stupid.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.980]   That's not part of what being part of a democracy is.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.620]   By the way, I want to talk about that for one second.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:07.500]   There was this thing that I sent you guys in the chat, and Nick, hopefully you post that in the
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.620]   show notes as well.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.300]   But there was a study that was done about cynicism.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:20.060]   And it went back and it did like a qualitative assessment of more than 200,000 people and their
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.460]   attitudes and their measured IQ, their measured literacy, their measured numeracy, and their
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.180]   measured earnings.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.860]   And here's what they found.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:36.140]   Cynicism is associated with lower IQ, lower literacy, lower numeracy and lower earnings.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:42.940]   The idea of cynical individuals being more competent appears to be a widespread, yet
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.260]   largely illusory lie.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.900]   So I think we have to teach people-
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.740]   I think this makes sense.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.460]   I mean-
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:56.300]   I was shocked by that study because I actually generally think cynical people must be smarter.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.380]   They're smarter because they're thinking more rationally and maybe I'm being emotional.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.820]   It turns out they're fucking stupid.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.860]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.780]   There's cynicism and then there's people who are cantankerous and not content.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.140]   And I think people sometimes conflate those two things.
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:10.860]   If you look at the people-
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.620]   But constant pervasive cynicism is not a feature of democracy.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.460]   It means that you just stop thinking for yourself as a protective mechanism.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.020]   Right.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.140]   But the people we know who have changed the world and who- they seem to be-
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.580]   They're not cynical.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.860]   They're not cynical.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.940]   They're actually delusional and optimistic or else they wouldn't have started a company
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:38.380]   to make electric cars or whatever piece of software or climate.com or synthetic biology.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.220]   You have to be a radical optimist.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:47.260]   I mean, we're literally trying to attack our incredible capitalists who are actually solving
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.980]   these problems while our politicians can't get their shit together and make desal plants
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:52.860]   and nuclear plants.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.380]   The private market seems like the only solution Sachs had ever-
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:56.700]   Well,
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:03.660]   there's an old saying that pessimists get to be right and optimists get to be rich.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.980]   And yeah.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:12.460]   I mean, if you think about it, pessimists don't create companies, right?
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:12.860]   No.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.300]   They throw rocks.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.660]   They become journalists.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.180]   They become shit posters on Twitter.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:17.420]   They become critics.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.140]   They become critics.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.180]   Anton Ego.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.740]   Right.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.620]   I hate TUI.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:26.540]   Sachs, what do you think about this idea that if we get into the throes of it for water,
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.940]   the folks that own water rights, I think that this is going to be like an eminent domain
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.860]   issue where the government is at some point just going to say, "Sorry, need it back.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.340]   It's mine."
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.740]   During an emergency, for sure.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.020]   For sure.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:45.980]   But I mean, I hate to use the words, "I agree with J-Cal," but
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.260]   you know, look, there's not a shortage of water in the world, right?
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:56.380]   I mean, the world is mostly water, so it is a function of building desalination plants if,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.820]   if that's what we need.
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.780]   There has to be a solution for that problem.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.740]   And Freiburg's right that maybe it does take a decade or two to put in place all that
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.300]   infrastructure, but then why didn't we start 10 years ago?
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.780]   You see, we should be starting a program where we convince the American public
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:19.660]   that abundance would lead to them having more freedom and our country being stronger.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:26.220]   Electrical abundance with nuclear, water abundance with desalinization, and
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.660]   agricultural abundance with those previous two.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.420]   Because if you had unlimited nuclear energy and you had unlimited clean water,
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:39.100]   the price of agriculture would go down and we'd have more free food for everybody or lower cost
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.340]   food.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.580]   I'll tell you, I'll tell you a theory I have on this.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:46.700]   And it's basically an anti-science theory, which is that, you know, culturally,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:51.100]   we've kind of developed this anti-innovation, anti-science mentality, broadly speaking, across
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.540]   kind of modern culture in the United States.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.060]   If you remember coming out of World War II,
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.860]   and I think it has its roots in the Cold War, you know, out of when World War II ended,
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.860]   you know, we were all in it together.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.900]   You know, this country, everyone bought the same stuff.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.660]   We all had Rice Krispies every day.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.460]   We all kind of, you know, were excited about our homes that look like everyone else's home
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.340]   on the block.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.500]   And technology was empowering all of this, right?
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.940]   There was a space race on.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.820]   There were plastics that were suddenly allowing us to make all sorts of amazing things.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.900]   There were chemicals that were creating new drugs for humans and new applications for our
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.540]   agriculture that was making an abundance of food and increasing lifespans and so on.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.940]   But then what happened in the late 60s and 70s is we realized we got ahead of ourselves.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.140]   And, you know, there was cancer from DDT.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.220]   There was, you know, Three Mile Island.
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:49.020]   There was a number of pollutants that got into the environment that permanently damaged
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.420]   the environment from chemical companies.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.100]   And we started to wake up and say, like, wait a second, all of this technology that we thought
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:55.740]   was so great.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.460]   And was giving us this extraordinary abundance, it turns out is really risky and can cause
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   massive unknown consequences.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.980]   And if you watch, I think I talked about this on our podcast once, but one of my favorite
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.540]   videos to watch, there's a video on YouTube from the Disney Channel History Institute.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.100]   And they show the history of Tomorrowland at Disneyland.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.620]   When Tomorrowland opened in 1955, every ride was all about adventuring into space and like
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.740]   traveling into the human body.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.020]   And they even had a ride for Monsanto where you would go into the micro world and look
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.060]   at plastics and stuff.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.580]   And it was all about this amazing abundance.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.540]   And technology.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.420]   And the guy, the narrator on the video says, beginning in the late 60s, early 70s, we changed
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.300]   all the rides.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.940]   And the rides all became about the fear of technology.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.020]   It was all about aliens attacking Earth.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:41.820]   It was all about Captain EO was like, you know, the world became robotic and got taken
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.500]   over by unnatural things.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   Even Star Tours was about a robot that went awry and the robot doesn't know what it's
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:47.740]   doing.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.300]   So it drove us off course and we had to survive the robot.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:55.180]   And so everything became subconscious or subliminally a little bit, this negative technology
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.420]   sentiment.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.580]   And I think that that still persists.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.860]   You know, there is an asymmetry.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.500]   People take for granted the abundance over time because you get used to it, but you feel
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.180]   the acute pain of the loss when technology goes awry.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.940]   And then that becomes the social conscience.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.380]   And I think we're still grappling with that.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.900]   And I don't know how you reverse it.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:17.580]   Well, you know what, Freeberg, are we not experiencing this right now, everybody, with
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:22.380]   COVID, where there's one group of people who are like, oh, my God, the science we were
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.260]   able to deploy in COVID and get through this so quickly.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:31.900]   It's so promising that the world's going to be better, net net after the pandemic, even
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.380]   with all the suffering, you could make an argument that that suffering is going to lead
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.500]   to more prosperity.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.140]   And there's another group of people who are like the Delta variant.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.500]   Let's get our masks back on.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.780]   And people want to take the Sinica rat on.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.420]   As an individual, I don't want harm done to me or my kids or my environment.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.580]   That's that's the I think the general kind of conscience.
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.220]   Right.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.100]   And I don't care about the abundance because
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   I've basically taken it for granted.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.060]   And so now I find myself as an individual saying, you know what, we shouldn't do nuclear
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.980]   because look at what happened in Fukushima, forgetting the fact that you've been living
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.580]   off of free electricity practically for decades or whatever the case might be.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.300]   And free water.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.580]   And free water and all these things.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.980]   And I think that the abundance that technology delivers to humans because humans are only
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.260]   programmed to recognize change.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.060]   They're not programmed to recognize absolutes.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.780]   There's a lot of good socio psychological and evolutionary.
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:23.740]   Give us an example of that.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.940]   Give us an example of that.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:30.460]   If you go to the store every day and you're used to just getting a $1 can of Coke, you don't say,
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.860]   oh my God, I feel it's an amazing world I live in.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.980]   I get a $1 can of Coke.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.300]   You never praise that $1 can of Coke.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:41.980]   Now, if you went to the store and the can of Coke went up to $2, you'd be like, what the heck?
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.820]   Why does Coke cost so much?
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.180]   And so, you know,
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.700]   so we habituate, but but you habituate to the great things in our life.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.020]   The price of Coke dropped to 50 cents.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.540]   You're like, okay, that feels good.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.780]   And then you get used to the price of Coke being 50 cents.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.100]   And a few weeks later, if it goes up, you're upset, but you're not as happy on the other way.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:04.220]   So human emotion is kind of asymmetrically, you know, defined by these negative consequences.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.860]   And I think over time, you accumulate these negative consequences as your core psyche,
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.700]   and you have an aversion to doing, you know, innovative things as a whole, not all people,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.220]   but as a whole, that's how we operate.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.300]   And it's why technology kind of gets lambasted over over time.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.140]   This is the most frustrating thing to me.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.620]   Chamath is that we have so many amazing things happening in technology, and nobody will
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:30.060]   10x or 100x on them from the government perspective or the public.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.700]   I had a company called Zero Mass on my podcast, which I think is now called Source.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.140]   And you're aware of this company.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.460]   Maybe you could talk a little bit about the impact hydro panels would make
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.140]   if we just embrace this technology.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.820]   Well, I mean, Source is an incredible, incredible company.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:54.460]   Basically, there's a there's a guy who runs a Cody Friesen, who when he was at MIT, basically developed
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:42:02.380]   a essentially a material, a membrane that can absorb the ambient water that's in the atmosphere,
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:08.300]   and basically allow you to collect it and to separate it into its components and to basically
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:14.940]   create potable salinized or potable drinkable water in a panel that looks like a solar panel.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.180]   So you put these solar arrays everywhere.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:23.260]   And out of the back, you put a little pipe and it collects the humidity in the ambient air and
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.300]   it spits out water.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.980]   And it's, it's an incredible thing.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.980]   And he's able to go and rewire schools.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.860]   And, and the thing is, he can go anywhere because again, he doesn't need anything, right?
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.460]   You literally put it on your roof.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.180]   It's incredible.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:40.300]   And it makes you if you I think he told me at the time when I interviewed him two or three years ago.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:46.780]   He said you could put two of these on your roof and get like four cases of bottled water a day,
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.940]   no matter where you were on the planet.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.340]   And by the way, he's moving to a place which is really cool.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.060]   He told me this.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.140]   I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyways.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.260]   This might be beeped.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.140]   Now where he's going to be candidate.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.820]   No, he'll have an eventual app where you can kind of direct the hydro panel to make the kind of
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.700]   water that you like.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:12.300]   So if you love or if you love, um, dial it in water, or if you love smart water or you're on
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.340]   the voice, right?
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.700]   Specifically because it's the most expensive.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.460]   No, I love, I love smart water.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:23.980]   I, I have a very gratuitous reason why I remember when I met jobs, he drank smart water.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.660]   And I thought, boop, it's good enough for him.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.540]   It's good enough for me.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.700]   I'll tell you when I knew Chamath made it.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.060]   I just get to copy people.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.420]   I can, you got to copy the good ones.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.140]   And I was just like,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.340]   this is a personal anecdote.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.780]   This is when I knew Chamath made it.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:39.260]   We used to play poker in his garage, in his little 3000 square foot Palo Alto house.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.980]   Little.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.500]   No, Burlington, Burlington, Burlington.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.460]   In Burlington, whatever.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.460]   He had this little tiny house and we're in the garage and he's like, look, I'm putting up a flat
[00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:46.860]   panel.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.980]   I'm going to like paint the walls.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.140]   No, we had a little, uh, you had a little, uh, easel and you'd write on chalk how much you owe.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.340]   You know, then.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.020]   Chamath's like, I got a new house.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.460]   He's got his new house.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.340]   We come over.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.540]   He's like, Jake, how you want some water?
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.420]   I'm like, yeah, I'd love a glass.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.380]   He's like, oh, Jake, how you want a beverage?
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:03.900]   I'm like, yeah, I'll take a glass of water.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.300]   And, uh, he goes, oh, and he walks over to a rack.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:12.300]   And in the rack, like, you know, those things you push wine on, there's a rack for water.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.020]   And there is Voss in the glass bottles.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   There is Evian in glass bottles.
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:17.340]   Old.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.700]   And you're not like the Evian that you get at the regular supermarket.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.180]   Like somebody sourced the Evian bottles, that restaurant.
[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:27.820]   And then he had the smart, I mean, there's 60 and I'm like, I just wanted a glass of water,
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.860]   but okay, I'll take the Evian in the glass bottle.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.140]   It was delightful.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.140]   Sax, I got three different bounce passes.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.580]   I can give you just where you want it.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.340]   Do you want cancel culture?
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.180]   Do you want Chesa Booden or.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.380]   COVID.
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.260]   What do you want?
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:41.900]   Or COVID?
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.340]   I can give you any of these.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:43.740]   I can.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.700]   I'm ready to pass.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.940]   I'm talking about any of those sound good to me.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.820]   I mean, the, the, the, it might be time for a chase update because we haven't done that
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.220]   in a while.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.020]   The killer DA.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.060]   The killer DA.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.660]   Oh, by the way, I just want to say, I found the journalist, you know, the journalist
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.700]   Sax, don't say her name.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.900]   And she is setting up her LLC and the $60,000 we raised from the GoFundMe is going to go
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.180]   to her to cover the DA's office for the next six to 12 months in a newsletter website.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:09.820]   Right.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.860]   And just to be clear, because I think people kind of misinterpreted what you were trying
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.780]   to do there with the GoFundMe JCal.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.180]   Yes.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.020]   This is not for opposition research.
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.580]   This is not.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:17.980]   No.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.340]   This is not digging up dirt.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.860]   This is reporting on, uh, on
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:29.180]   On public policy on what should be public facts with respect to what the DA's office
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.220]   is doing, how chase is performing in his job.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.380]   Isn't it interesting though, how the left journalists, when I hired investigative
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.980]   journalists to cover criminal justice accused me of hiring an oppo researcher and these
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:43.580]   are investigative journalists.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:47.580]   And I told them explicitly, I'm just hiring an investigative journalist to cover crime
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:48.220]   in San Francisco.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.500]   There's no oppo research here.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.460]   And they insisted on saying, I wanted to get into Chessa's personal life.
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.700]   And I,
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.940]   explicitly said that's not what this is for.
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.180]   Well, let's face it.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.500]   There aren't too many journalists anymore who are investigative, who are actually in
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.220]   the business of turning up new facts about elected officials.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.980]   They're too busy pushing a narrative.
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.220]   They're engaged in agenda journalism.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.460]   And actually we saw a really good example just to tie into, to what's happened, what
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:17.020]   happened over the past week is you had this story in the San Francisco Chronicle, which
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:22.540]   is basically pure propaganda, uh, from, you could see that the,
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:30.780]   the, um, the passing from Chessa to this reporter of this, this farcical, uh, claim
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.020]   that crime is falling in San Francisco.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.460]   Uh, I mean, this claim is so preposterous.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:43.180]   This is the same week we saw viral videos of 10 robbers bursting out of Neiman Marcus,
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.460]   you know, with,
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.580]   With every hand.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.620]   And so, you know, plus you had the viral,
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.260]   It was scary.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.380]   You had the viral video of the, the guy going into,
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.140]   into CVS and just, you know, it wasn't even shoplifting.
[00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.780]   It was, it was throwing up garbage bags.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.180]   Did you see Brian Sugar's, uh, video of the person who broke into his house,
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.860]   stole his kids' iPads and everything while they were in the house?
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.340]   Right.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.620]   And Cyan Bannister, who had another home invasion, just tweeted.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:15.740]   Home invasions are now, um, not prosecutable crimes in San Francisco.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:19.820]   Well, no, what they're doing is, so what Cyan reported about her case is, and by the way,
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.220]   her case is in the public eye.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:22.940]   Okay.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:27.740]   So it's very brazen for the DA to be doing this, but what they did is they dropped the home
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:34.220]   invasion charges and they're just treating it as basically a, a theft of, you know, a few hundred
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:39.900]   dollars, you know, that does not capture the violation of breaking into someone's house and
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.420]   how dangerous that is.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.660]   But I originally, I thought, okay, why is the DA's office doing this originally?
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.660]   I thought, well, maybe it's just because, you know,
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.700]   Chasey doesn't want to incarcerate anybody, but it's more than that.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.060]   You see, if they drop the charge, they're going to be in jail.
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.780]   They're going to be in prison.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.740]   They're going to be in prison for a long period of time.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.940]   It's like, Oh, well, what's going on with this case?
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.620]   And then, you know, they're going to be in prison for a long time.
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.340]   And then they're going to be in prison for a long time.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.060]   So they're going to have to go through all these charges down to petty larceny.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.580]   Then he can include it in a different stat.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.860]   You see home burglaries are up by some gargantuan amount, like 50% year over year.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:05.660]   Oh.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.340]   They want to be able to claim crime is falling.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:13.820]   It's now they're juking the stats by reducing the charges from the more serious crime to the less serious crime.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.180]   And then what they do is.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.860]   Wow. They're shaping the stats.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.820]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.020]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:20.060]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.020]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:21.980]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.860]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.660]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:24.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.140]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.940]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:27.740]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.540]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:29.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.380]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.500]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.500]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.700]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.500]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.020]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.060]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.100]   They're juking the stats.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.060]   They're juking the stats.

[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.140]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.140]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.140]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:13.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.380]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.500]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.540]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.580]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.620]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.660]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.700]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.740]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.780]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.820]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.940]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.980]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.020]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.060]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:43.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.180]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.220]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.260]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.300]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.340]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.380]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.420]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.460]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.500]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.540]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.580]   They're juking the stats.
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.700]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.740]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.780]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.820]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.860]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.820]   They're juking the stats.
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:11.340]   You had this senior policy advisor to Chesa Boudin who works for the DA's office named
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:22.620]   Kate Chatfield, attacker basically implying her views were KKK values for having the audacity
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.060]   to warn that people are worried about crime in San Francisco.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.180]   So she gets attacked.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:32.620]   By the way, this Chatfield person, the top of her profile is the clenched fist of the
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.220]   communist revolution, J. Cal.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:35.660]   So this is who's running the DA.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:35.740]   I love this.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:35.780]   I love this.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:35.820]   I love this.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.060]   I love this.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.060]   I love this.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.140]   I love this.
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:36.380]   I love this.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:36.460]   I love this.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.900]   But look, it's not just trolling, and it's not even just slander.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:47.180]   It's I think an abuse of power for someone in the DA's office to go after and attack
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:49.820]   a concerned citizen like this, okay?
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.340]   But this is how they enforce.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.940]   Can you read the tweet that she did?
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:53.820]   Do you have that there?
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:00.380]   Because she basically is, the people who have experienced home invasions are concerned
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.980]   for the safety of their families.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.780]   And what this woman did, Michelle, I believe is her name, she just-
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.100]   She just said, like, people are scared for their families.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:17.640]   And then Kate Chatfield referenced Birth of a Nation and compared her to, oh, our wives
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.740]   are not safe because of Black people.
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.740]   And that's a KKK-
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.740]   Birth of a Nation.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.740]   Birth of a Nation.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.740]   Everybody knows Birth of a Nation.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   Birth of a Nation.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.740]   Everybody understands what Birth of a Nation is.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.740]   Yeah, the original name of Birth of a Nation, I think, was the Klansmen.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   It's like a KKK piece of propaganda.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.740]   Wow.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.740]   But it's really outrageous.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.740]   She just blocked me.
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.740]   She just blocked me.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.700]   Kate Chatfield blocked me.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:38.700]   Wow.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.740]   This is a public policy advisor who's now hiding her account.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:45.240]   Well, I mean, a public official should not do that.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   I mean, they should be-
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.600]   And so this set you off.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   Let's be honest.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   It set you off.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   Well, I know Michelle Tandler.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   She worked at Yammer.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:57.500]   And I thought it was out of bounds for not just a public official, but someone in the
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.700]   DA's office who has the power-
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   So what did you do?
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   Well, I just-
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.700]   You went into revenge mode.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.700]   Let's be honest.
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.700]   No, no.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.700]   I don't-
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.700]   I don't think you did.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.700]   I don't think you did.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.700]   You just went into a little bit.
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:09.700]   Tweaked.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.960]   I donated another $50,000 to the Recall Chasing Campaign.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.260]   And you dedicated it to Kate.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.120]   You said, "This is for you."
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.020]   Yeah, because look, this is threatening.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:26.660]   Every American should have the right to criticize their government without having its law enforcement
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.120]   arm come down on them.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:34.580]   And so here you have a legitimate concern expressed by a private citizen and the DA's
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:35.660]   office is coming down on them.
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.660]   That's not acceptable.
[00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.480]   I think I need to break some news here.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.840]   I didn't want to talk about this publicly, but I'm so outraged now that I think I should
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.980]   let this out.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:52.420]   So while I- after the- in the weeks after I started that campaign to hire an investigative
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:55.100]   journalist for Chester's office, this is breaking news.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.220]   I haven't talked about this publicly, but I'm going to break it now.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.400]   Do you know who contacted me?
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.660]   The DA's office.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.620]   Do you know what that means?
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.100]   Do you know what they contacted me about?
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.900]   They were investigating a startup that I had invested in.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.500]   I won't say which one.
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.580]   And they wanted to interview me about my involvement with that startup because that startup had
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:24.380]   some complaint from a downstream investor who felt that they were committing some type
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.020]   of fraud or problem.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.020]   Coincidence?
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.020]   Are you serious?
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.020]   I am dead serious.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.460]   This is literally becoming Chinatown.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.580]   They literally tried to intimidate me and I didn't want to bring it up.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.620]   I talked to the person on the phone, the person from the DA's office who was investigating
[00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.160]   this, and I was like, "Do I need an attorney for this?
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.160]   Why are you calling me?"
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.640]   And he said, "Well, you know, we just want to talk to you about this."
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   No.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.640]   We have a bunch of questions.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   And I just said, "You know what?
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   Subpoena me.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.960]   I'm not, you know, file something and I'll come in with my attorney to talk to you, but
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.580]   I'm not going to talk with you on background.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.580]   No."
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:00.900]   So they literally tried to intimidate me.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:01.900]   You know what?
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.580]   And I kind of let them because I didn't want to make it public, but I'm making it public
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.580]   now.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:11.080]   And this is two weeks after I said, "Let's hire the journalist."
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.540]   It's intimidation tactics.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.040]   It is intimidation tactics.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.040]   That's intimidation.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.040]   I will not be intimidated, Chessa.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.040]   All right.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.700]   But what you can see here is, okay, look.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.700]   I mean, I was intimidated.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:27.700]   I'm not going to have me intimidated again.
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:32.480]   Now that I think about it, like I didn't do anything wrong here.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   I put 50k.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.540]   I put 50 or 100k into a company that didn't work.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.540]   I put 50 to the company that didn't work.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:37.540]   I put 50 to the company that didn't work.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:38.540]   I put 50 to the company that didn't work.
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:39.540]   And now some other investor is complaining.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.540]   And they're trying to tie it back to me somehow.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.540]   But Jason, of course, you're going to be intimidated.
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:47.580]   The chief law enforcement officer of San Francisco is basically trying to make you the target
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.540]   of an investigation because of what you said publicly.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.540]   Of course, that is intimidation.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.200]   Guys, isn't it possible that they're just interviewing you about a fraud claim?
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.980]   I mean, like what this...
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.980]   Wait, wait, hold on.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:59.980]   Think about the timing, Freebird.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:00.980]   It's two or three weeks after...
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:01.980]   AM radio, like conspiracy theory, like...
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.980]   No, it's not.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   Two or three weeks after...
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.900]   You know what?
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:05.500]   I got it.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.500]   I got it.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.500]   I got to tell you something.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.500]   A police officer drove past my house last night.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.500]   Freebird.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.500]   Okay.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.460]   Wait, it's the first and only time I've ever been contacted by a law enforcement officer
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:16.460]   over an investment.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.180]   I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   Stop committing fraud.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   350 investments.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.620]   Listen, Chesa has not had time.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.820]   He's almost two years in office now, and he has not had time to successfully prosecute
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.900]   one murder trial.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.900]   Not one.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.460]   But his office has time to run down whatever they're trying to run down with J-Cal.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:41.460]   They don't have time to prosecute the home invader who broke into Cyan Banister's home.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:42.460]   Or Brian's.
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:43.460]   Or Brian's.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.460]   They don't have time to do that, but they somehow have time to contact J-Cal.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.460]   He tweeted the video.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.460]   Let me explain what's going on here.
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.460]   There's two things going on.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.460]   I think one of which is becoming very well understood, but the other one is not.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.460]   The first one is the Gothamization of San Francisco.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   We understand that crime is out of control.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.460]   Cynicism and resignation, people are just kind of given into it.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.460]   It feels like San Francisco has become Gotham City.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:09.460]   These viral videos of the robbers brazenly committing daylight theft.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.460]   There is no punishment.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.460]   Beating up UPS drivers in the street.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:12.460]   Beating a UPS driver in the street.
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.460]   Because there is no consequence, okay?
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:20.460]   But there's a second thing happening, which is the Orwellianization of San Francisco government
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.460]   and San Francisco politics.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.460]   You not only have the crime, you've got the brazen lies about the crime.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:31.460]   You've got this insistence on this Animal Farm Commandment that crime is falling.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.460]   And if you question it, you are a bad person.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.420]   Are a Klansman.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:35.420]   You are a Klansman.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:39.420]   And then they get their, you know, the Kate Chatfields to push this out.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   And then they get academics to back this up, okay?
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   There are now, they get their friends in the media and in the academy to give these spurious claims credence.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   And then the final step is that the rich virtue signalers pay these people off.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.420]   They pay the protection money.
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   Who might that be?
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:58.420]   Who's paying off?
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:03.420]   The Dustin Moskovitz's, the Mike Krieger's, the Reed Hastings.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   And, you know, even actually the biggest contributor to Chesa right now is a guy who's under SEC indictment for the Ripple scandal.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   Oh, no.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:15.420]   Chris?
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   Chris, yes, exactly.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:22.420]   So, people who need to curry favor either because they've got their own problems or they just like to virtue signal.
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   Chris Larsen.
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:24.420]   Chris Larsen is Chesa's biggest.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.420]   Then fund this Orwellian campaign.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.420]   That is dark.
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:32.420]   Brian Sugar released the video and that person's not going to be prosecuted.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.420]   I mean, that is the crazy part.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   You get somebody on camera and they won't prosecute them.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.420]   And people forget these are organized gangs that are doing this.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:36.420]   This has been proven.
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.420]   This is not a poverty issue.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   These are not poor people who are stealing bread for their families or trying to make their rent.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.420]   It's organized gangs.
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   Right.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.420]   Did you see the getaway cars?
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   Who realized with Prop 47.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   Did you see the getaway cars for the Neiman Marcus heist?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   Yeah, they're all like.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.420]   The Mercedes.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.420]   They're driving great, beautiful cars with their license plates off.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.420]   This is like mob behavior.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.420]   And if you give credit to the people who are doing this, they're going to get a lot of
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.420]   credit.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:51.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:54.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.

[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:06.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:15.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.

[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   And I think that's the biggest thing.
