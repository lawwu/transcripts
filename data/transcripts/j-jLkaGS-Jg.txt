[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   People who just look at my matches with Deep Blue 20 years ago or recent games are played
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.280]   by newer machines in Go or in popular video game Dota.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.160]   That means a very important point that in all these cases, all these games are different.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.920]   Go, for instance, is much more complex than chess.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.440]   It's more abstract, more strategic, so it's more difficult to accumulate sophisticated
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.040]   knowledge as we did in chess.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.480]   But all these games, they represent closed systems, which means we humans fill the machine
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.080]   with a target, with rules.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   There's no automatic transfer of the knowledge that machines could accumulate in closed systems
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.840]   to open-ended systems.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.560]   Machines can do many things, and they will learn even more things in the future, but
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   I don't see any chance in the foreseeable future for machines to ask the right questions.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.920]   Now, they can ask questions, but they don't know what questions are relevant.
