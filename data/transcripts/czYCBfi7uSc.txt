[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   I just, I wanted to do a case study.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.580]   I like doing case studies so we can see some of my ideas and action in the real
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.980]   world. So I have a, a written case study here from Liz.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.080]   And so I'm going to read what Liz sent me.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.240]   Thanks to your books and podcasts.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.960]   I doubled my income while cutting my hours in half.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.660]   I am a freelance copywriter working in the advertising space.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.780]   I came up through the ranks working the 60 plus hour weeks that advertising is
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.620]   known for.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.980]   But along the way I created some commercials and campaigns that got national
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.620]   recognition and earned me enough career capital to go freelance after the birth
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.460]   of my first son.
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.420]   That career capital was enough to get me clients as the new freelancer,
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.100]   but not enough to get me the lifestyle I was hoping for.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.820]   I was still working crazy hours and feeling burnt out.
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.460]   This is where your ideas changed my life.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.900]   I began implementing office hours with my clients via
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.300]   Slack and devoting large chunks of my day to doing uninterrupted writing.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.380]   This immediately increased my quality of work while cutting my hours by at least
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500]   30%, if not more.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.660]   My clients didn't bat an eye because I was still agreeing to use their preferred
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.740]   method of communication,
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.740]   which was Slack and I was responding promptly to them during my next office
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.580]   hour.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.460]   It also didn't hurt that I framed those office hours as a way to maximize their
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.140]   money.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.380]   Because at the end of the day,
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.460]   every client will acknowledge they aren't paying me to talk to them on Slack.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060]   They're paying me to write good ads.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.420]   I also quit all forms of social media,
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.660]   which has given me so much more mental clarity than I ever could have imagined.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.620]   And I think has increased my overall productivity just as much as time
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.100]   blocking and office hours.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.260]   Since going freelance,
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.780]   I have raised my rates twice without losing any clients.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.860]   Right now I am on retainer with two different agencies for a total of 40 hours.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.580]   But since implementing your practices has allowed me to work so much,
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.460]   much quicker,
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.620]   I often complete my work in half that time.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.860]   I spend this extra time picking up odd freelance jobs for extra income,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.340]   reading books or going on phone free walks.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.180]   I also stop work at 3pm every day to be with my older son when he gets home from
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.020]   preschool.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.580]   It's exactly the lifestyle I had imagined with going freelance and I couldn't have
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.340]   done it without you. Thank you.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.900]   So Jesse,
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.140]   I love this case study for multiple reasons because it has
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.540]   multiple ideas we talk about working.
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.660]   And so I'm looking at my notes here about this case study.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.020]   First,
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.660]   is this the,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.740]   the career capital framework?
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.660]   I think that was absolutely the right framework for Liz to think about her
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.260]   career.
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.700]   Yep.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.340]   So her ultimate goal was to be freelance with flexible hours with good
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.180]   compensation.
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.220]   But you know,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.540]   I'm done with work by three.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.940]   And so she got enough career capital to go freelance by being so good.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.660]   She couldn't be ignored.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.820]   She had some ad campaigns that won awards,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.820]   got national recognition,
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.580]   but it wasn't yet enough to get her to the schedule she wanted.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.900]   And so there she threw in,
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.340]   she had the capital for it.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.420]   Then she threw in tactics.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.220]   So it's this combination of career capital and tactics aimed at the
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.020]   particular vision you have of your lifestyle.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.820]   So she put that together really nicely.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.460]   If she had only done one and not the other,
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.260]   it would have been a problem.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.060]   If she had only focused on career capital,
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.460]   as we saw,
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.300]   she was still crazy busy,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   even after she was nationally recognized.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.820]   And if she had only focused on strategies,
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.260]   she would have had trouble because if she wasn't doing work that was being
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.340]   nationally recognized,
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.140]   no one cares what your time management strategies are.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.980]   They're not going to hire you.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.740]   And so I thought that combination was very powerful.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.980]   Second thing I noticed here,
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.980]   um,
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.820]   was this notion.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.660]   I talk about this in a world without email.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.900]   People are afraid of if I put structure to communication with clients,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.260]   they will not tolerate it.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.780]   They demand accessibility.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.740]   I always argue that's not true.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.580]   Clients don't need accessibility.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.860]   They need consistency.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.740]   They need to understand if I need to contact you,
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.900]   how does that work?
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.380]   And if they understand how that works,
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.020]   the accessibility is not so important.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.100]   Accessibility is only important if there's no other system.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.260]   So if it's just,
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.620]   I don't know,
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.900]   we just slack back and forth,
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.260]   then I really need you to answer my slack right away because otherwise I have to
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.900]   like sit around and wait and I don't know what I'm going to get an answer.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.260]   But if you have something that's consistent and clear,
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.820]   like office hours every day,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940]   that's when I will answer you.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.460]   That's completely fine because what you're providing for the client is clarity.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.740]   Oh,
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.980]   okay.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.580]   So Liz,
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.980]   I can't just slack her right now.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.300]   Um,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.700]   but at three o'clock or two o'clock or whatever I can,
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.300]   and she'll answer,
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.140]   or I can send this to her now and expect an answer at two.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.700]   Great.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.500]   I have clarity here.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.580]   It's consistent and clear.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.740]   I don't have to worry about this.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.820]   Let me move on with all these other things I care about in my life.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.860]   I don't care that she answers my slack right now.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.580]   I care that I know and can trust when she will.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.460]   And so this clarity over accessibility is a theme that comes up often.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.780]   Liz lived that out.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.340]   Her clients were fine.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.340]   Okay.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.100]   I can wait till office hours.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.540]   I don't care.
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.580]   Just tell me how I do this.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.780]   Great.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.260]   Office hours.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.500]   Good.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.060]   Let's roll.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.300]   And so she lost no clients doing that.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.540]   Um,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.940]   I also like she quit social media.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.820]   We often see this as two different magisteria.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.180]   There's your personal life being on your phone.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.900]   This is like digital minimalism applies.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.900]   And then you have your professional life and it's about email and slack.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.460]   And that's where books like deep work in a world without email apply.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.300]   They're not so separate.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.700]   And as Liz learned,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.820]   especially as a freelancer,
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.500]   what she was looking at,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.100]   at her phone,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.980]   the distraction that engendered though,
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.260]   not coming from clients and not directly related to work,
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.380]   distracted her from her work.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.860]   And it was taking her much more time to get things done.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.060]   So when she got rid of social media,
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.460]   she's locked in when I'm working,
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.340]   I'm working and you don't have this back and forth.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.060]   I think that's a big part of my own success is my lack of social media use
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.460]   means I'm working.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.980]   I'm working.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.860]   This is why a lot gets produced,
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.060]   even though I work a very standard number of hours.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.780]   And the final thing I'll say,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.380]   I really liked about Liz's case study is that it is lifestyle centric career
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.180]   planning.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.060]   She was a copywriter working big hours.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.340]   Instead of just saying,
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.260]   I just want to quit or I want to make more money.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.660]   She said,
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.940]   what lifestyle do I want?
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.940]   She wanted autonomy.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.060]   She wanted to be done by work by three to spend time with her kids and have
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.380]   similar compensation to what she was getting for working 60 plus hours.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.820]   And there wasn't a switch she could flick the mint tomorrow.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.660]   I'm going to have that,
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.980]   but she knew what she was working backwards from.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.420]   And she changed after change.
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:33.500]   Let me get really good.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.820]   So good.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.420]   I can't ignore you.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.220]   Let me go freelance.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.060]   Now that I'm freelancing,
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.860]   let me throw in tactics.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.380]   Let me tame the way I deal with clients.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.220]   Let me work with distractions,
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.100]   work,
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.300]   work,
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.460]   work,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.100]   work all towards this eventual goal.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.780]   And then she hit it.
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.620]   So she started with the lifestyle and that drove all of these decisions.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.700]   And she finally got there.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.940]   And as she says,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.700]   it's exactly the lifestyle she had imagined.
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.100]   So Liz,
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.860]   I really liked that case study.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.460]   This is my advice and action for crafting a deep life.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.060]   Make and double the money too.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.660]   Oh yeah.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.580]   So I had that wrong.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.420]   She's doubling.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.540]   She's raised her weight rates twice and she's on a 40 hour a week retainer.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.220]   So she's probably making more bank than she was doing 60 hour weeks.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.220]   I like it.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.780]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.700]   All right.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.180]   Well, good work Liz.
