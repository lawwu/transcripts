[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.620]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.500]   He's a neuroscientist at Stanford,
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.900]   a world-class researcher and educator,
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.980]   and now he has a new podcast on YouTube
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.300]   and all the usual places called Huberman Lab
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.140]   that I can't recommend highly enough.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.220]   Quick mention of our sponsors.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.280]   Masterclass Online Courses for Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.420]   Magic Spoon Low-Carb Cereal,
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.700]   and BetterHelp Online Therapy.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.660]   Click the sponsor links to get a discount.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.340]   By the way, Masterclass is testing to see
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.900]   if they want to support this podcast long-term.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.260]   So if you're on the fence, now is the time to sign up.
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.160]   And I'm pretty sure Andrew will have
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.660]   a neuroscience masterclass on there soon enough,
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.300]   though his podcast is basically
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.820]   a weekly masterclass in itself.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.060]   As a side note, let me say that Andrew is a friend
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.740]   and a new collaborator.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.620]   We're working on a paper together
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.500]   about a topic we're both really passionate about.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.380]   At the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.660]   But that's probably many months away from being published.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.740]   Still, I'm really excited about this work.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.700]   He's one of the smartest and kindest people
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.100]   I have the pleasure of talking to on this podcast.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.380]   So I hope we'll talk many more times in the future.

[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.260]   And now, here's my conversation with Andrew Huberman.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.460]   Why do humans need sleep?
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.540]   Let's go with a big first question.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.900]   - Okay, well, the answer I'll start with
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.580]   is the one that I always default to
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.500]   when there's a why question.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.260]   I wasn't consulted at the design phase.
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.260]   So I wriggle my way out of giving a absolute answer, right?
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.140]   But there's one mechanism that's very clear,
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.300]   that's super important,
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.100]   which is that the longer we are awake,
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.100]   the more adenosine accumulates in our brain.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.460]   And adenosine binds to adenosine receptors,
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.580]   no surprise there.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.380]   And it creates the feeling of sleepiness,
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.700]   independent of time of day or night.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.300]   So there are two mechanisms.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.060]   One is we get sleepy as adenosine accumulates.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.180]   The longer we've been awake,
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.160]   the more adenosine is accumulated in our system.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   But how sleepy we get for a given amount of adenosine
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.700]   depends on where we are in this so-called circadian cycle.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.900]   And the circadian cycle is just this
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.300]   very, very well-conserved oscillation.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.100]   It's a temperature oscillation
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.860]   where you go from a low point.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.500]   Typically, if you're awake during the day
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.980]   and you're asleep at night,
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.660]   your lowest temperature point will be like 3 a.m., 4 a.m.,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.660]   and then your temperature will start to creep up
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.900]   as you wake up in the morning,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.400]   and then it'll peak in the late afternoon,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   and then it'll start to drop again toward the evening,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   and then you get sleep again.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.480]   That oscillation in temperature takes 24 hours.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.760]   - Plus or minus. - Temperature.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.620]   - Yeah, plus or minus an hour.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.640]   And I don't, even though I wasn't consulted
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.720]   at the design phase, I do not think it's a coincidence
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.320]   that it's aligned to the 24-hour spin of the earth
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.580]   on its axis, and the fact that we tend to be bathed
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.460]   in sunlight for a portion of that spin,
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.320]   and in darkness for the other portion of that spin.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.640]   So there are two mechanisms, the Adenosine accumulation
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   and the Circadian time point that we happen to be at,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   and those converge to create a sense
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   of sleepiness, a wakefulness.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.140]   The simple way to reveal these two mechanisms,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.880]   to uncouple them, is stay up for 24 hours,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.440]   and you will find that even though you've been,
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.240]   let's say you stay up midnight, 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.280]   provided you're on a regular schedule,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.440]   like that I follow, not like the kind that you follow,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.280]   you get, I will get very sleepy around 3, 4 a.m.,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.200]   but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m.,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.680]   which is my normal wake up time,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.720]   I'll start to feel more alert,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.000]   even though Adenosine has been accumulating further.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.920]   So Adenosine is higher for me, the longer I stay up,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.000]   and yet I feel more alert than I did a few hours ago,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.640]   and that's because these are two interacting forces.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.520]   So Adenosine makes you sleepy, and then just how sleepy
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.000]   or how awake you feel also depends on where you are
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.240]   in this temperature oscillation that takes 24 hours.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.280]   - Okay, so that's fascinating.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.720]   So there's a bunch of oscillations going on,
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.160]   and then they kind of, through the evolutionary process,
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   have evolved to all be aligned somewhat,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.600]   and they interplay.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.180]   So you said your body temperature goes up and down,
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.600]   there's chemicals in your brain that oscillate,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.200]   and then there's the actual oscillation
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   of the sun in the sky.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.000]   So all of that together
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   has some impact on each other,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.240]   and somehow that all results in us
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.280]   wanting to go to sleep every night.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.120]   - Right, and we can get right into the meat of this,
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   I guess we just dove right in.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.800]   The temperature oscillation is the effector
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   of the circadian clock.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.440]   So every cell in our body has a 24-hour rhythm
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   that's dictated by genes like clock, per, b-mal.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   This is one of the great successes of biology,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.600]   they give a Nobel Prize to Ruppert,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.920]   I don't know if Ruppert got it, forgive me,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.840]   but sorry, if you got it, Steve,
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.880]   congratulations, if you didn't,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   I'm sorry, I wasn't on the committee.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.600]   Nonetheless, did beautiful work,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.960]   Steve Ruppert and others,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.360]   but Mike Roshbosch and like other people
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.920]   worked out these mechanisms in flies,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.120]   in bacteria, in mammals,
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.400]   there are these genes that create 24-hour oscillations
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.600]   in gene expression, et cetera, in every cell of our body.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.200]   But what aligns those is a signal
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.620]   from the master circadian clock,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.200]   which sits right above the roof of the mouth,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.640]   called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   and that clock synchronizes all the clocks of the body
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.920]   to this general temperature rhythm
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.000]   by way of controlling systemic temperature,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.080]   which makes perfect sense.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.240]   If you want to create a general oscillation
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.560]   in all the tissues and organs of the body, use temperature.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.800]   And so that work on temperature,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.980]   if people want to explore it further,
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.520]   was Joe Takahashi, who was at Northwestern now,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.480]   at UT Southwestern in Dallas.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.360]   And it is absolutely clear
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.640]   that humans do better on a diurnal schedule,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160]   sorry Lex, than a nocturnal schedule.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.960]   Because you could say, well,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.440]   provided I sleep and push adenosine back downhill,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.520]   which is what happens when we sleep,
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.360]   adenosine is then reduced,
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.480]   and provided I am on more or less a 24-hour schedule,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.760]   why should it matter that I'm awake when the sun's out
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.700]   and I'm asleep when the sun is down?
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.880]   But it turns out that if you look at health metrics,
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.180]   people that are strictly nocturnal
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.500]   do far worse on immune function,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.260]   on metabolic function, et cetera,
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.580]   than people who are diurnal,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.740]   who are awake during the daytime.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.660]   And animals that are nocturnal, it's the opposite.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.660]   And animals that are so-called crepuscular,
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.660]   which tend to be active at dawn and at dusk,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.920]   this is a beautiful system,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.120]   I won't go down that rabbit hole,
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.400]   but these are animals whose visual systems operate best.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.660]   They tend to be predators like mountain lions.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.280]   They have optimized their waking times
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.740]   for the times when the animals they eat
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.320]   can't see well in those light conditions.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.020]   But given the rod-cone ratios in their eyes,
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.020]   the mountain lion is picking off,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.260]   it's like when you see special forces
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.660]   and they are looking through night vision goggles
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.780]   and they have a clear advantage, right?
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.220]   They are seeing in the dark.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.420]   That's basically what it's like to be a mountain lion
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.860]   as opposed to a bunny rabbit.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.260]   - Would you say that a lot of these cycles
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.140]   evolved in the predator-prey relationships
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.920]   of the different, throughout the food chain?
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.200]   So it's basically all somehow has to do with survival
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.960]   in this complicated web of predators and prey?
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.980]   - Almost certainly.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.760]   There had to have been a time in which
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.500]   humans being awake and active at night
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.700]   as opposed to during the day
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.180]   led to higher levels of lethality.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.320]   And probably particular in kids,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.900]   you imagine kids running around in the dark
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.760]   and getting where there are a lot of animals
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.620]   that can see really well under those conditions
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.600]   and humans can't.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.620]   And this would be all pre-electricity.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.060]   Even if you're carrying a torch,
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.180]   I mean the range of illumination on a torch
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.900]   is nothing compared to what a nighttime predator
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.340]   like a large cat or something can do.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.700]   I mean, they basically, they can see everything
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.620]   they need to in order to eat us
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.260]   and not the other way around.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.380]   - So one fascinating thing you said
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.620]   is that blew my mind and we went right past it,
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.540]   which is the temperature is a really powerful,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.620]   like if you were to think about the ways
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.940]   that different parts of the body,
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.540]   different systems in the body
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.460]   would communicate with each other,
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.020]   temperature would be a really good one.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.580]   And that just, I mean maybe it's obvious,
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.020]   but it kind of blew my mind just now
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.640]   that yeah, these systems are all distributed.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.480]   - Right.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.020]   - And they have to kind of,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.680]   they're not actually sending signals,
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.820]   but they're coordinating.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.460]   They need some sort of universal thing to look at
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.980]   in order to coordinate.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.020]   And temperature is a nice one to build around.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.260]   And that way you could control the behavior
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.420]   of all these different systems
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.340]   by controlling the temperature.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.180]   - Right.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.060]   It's attractive to think of a mechanism
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.340]   where this master circadian clock secretes a peptide
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.520]   or something that goes and locks to receptors
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.380]   in all the cells and gets it just right.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.020]   But that leaves far too much room for variability,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.780]   binding affinities, cells in a lot of parts of our body
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.540]   are at different stages of maturation.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.820]   They're turning over liver cells and so forth.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.260]   And for instance, we have a clock in our gut
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.180]   and in our liver,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.100]   such that if we were just take out your liver
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.540]   and put it on a table
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.340]   and just look at the expression of these genes,
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.620]   it would be in a 24 hour oscillation on its own.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.580]   It's independent.
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.280]   But something has to entrain them
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.580]   and keep them all synchronized.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.820]   And so it's not obvious that it would be temperature.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.420]   Takahashi's great gift to biology was to show
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   that all the stuff coming out of this master circadian clock
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.940]   at the end of the day,
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.940]   that's a weird statement, no pun intended,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.740]   at the end of the day and the night,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.120]   at the end of the story,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.260]   it all boils down to making sure
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.740]   that the temperature of tissues
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   oscillates in the same fashion.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   - That's blowing my mind
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.780]   and thinking like what other mechanism could possibly exist
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.540]   to create that kind of oscillation.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.700]   - You're Russian, it's cold in Russia for a lot of the year.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.780]   The hibernation signal in certain animals
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:30.980]   is a remarkable signal.
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.140]   There are peptides secreted from this very same clock
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.700]   that in animals like ground squirrels or bears,
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.860]   they go into a kind of a torpor
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.260]   where everything, reproduction, metabolism,
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.260]   everything is reduced while they're in their cave.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.460]   They don't actually stay asleep all of winter,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.580]   that's a myth.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.940]   And they actually do these very dramatic
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.460]   and periodic arousals from hibernation
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.860]   where they just shake and shake and shake,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.700]   it looks like a seizure
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.700]   and then they go back under into the torpor.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.220]   That's from a peptide that's released.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.060]   But that's different
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.620]   because that's about shutting down the whole system.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.740]   It's clear that having these very regular oscillations
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.420]   every 24 hours is essential for everything
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.700]   from metabolism to reproduction.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.220]   - Is there an optimal temperature for sleep
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.340]   that I should mention, I think your latest episode,
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:27.620]   and people should go check out helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.420]   to support Andrew.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.520]   - Thanks for the plug.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.860]   (both laughing)
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.780]   I mean, the amazing thing about the stuff they create,
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.780]   and oh, and yes, you have a new podcast, that's amazing.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.500]   And this past month he did a whole series on sleep,
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.100]   which people should definitely check out.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.860]   There's some podcasts that come out
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.240]   that just make me wanna be a better human being
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.300]   by just the quality.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.180]   Three Blue One Brown, Grant Sanderson is like that for me.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.780]   Just like, wow, this is, education is best.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.540]   So Andrew symbolizes that, captures that brilliantly.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.780]   So go support the sponsor
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.100]   so he doesn't stop doing the thing.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.860]   So they, I think they have a cooling pad too.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.700]   So I, Eight Sleep Mattress sponsors me.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.740]   They've been, they sent me a mattress and it's been,
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.300]   I've never, listen, I used to sleep on the floor.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.580]   - Sleep where you fall.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.380]   - Sleep where I fall, I don't give a shit.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.900]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.260]   So like I would have never bought a nice mattress
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.860]   'cause it's like, why, I'm fine.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.780]   This is the floor, it's fine.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.060]   But it was a game changer
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.460]   to be able to control temperature.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.000]   Like for me, it's cooling.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.540]   I don't know what the hell it is.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.940]   - Well, you want the brain and nervous system
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.420]   and rest of the body needs to drop
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.620]   by about anywhere from two to three degrees
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.620]   in order to get into your deepest sleep
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.140]   and transition to sleep.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.100]   That's really gonna help.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.660]   You don't wanna be cold that you're bothered
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.660]   and can't fall asleep.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.800]   But that's why some people like it really cold in the room
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.260]   and under a warm blanket or with socks on for some people.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.680]   That can be good because this temperature oscillation
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.540]   is such that as your temperature is dropping,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.900]   that correlates with the,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.980]   generally with the most sleepy phase
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.180]   of your circadian cycle.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.980]   So cool is better for falling and staying asleep
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.060]   and sleeping deeply.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.820]   - And then I guess like that's what Eight Sleep showed.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.560]   They have like an app is it warms back up to wake you up.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.620]   The idea that I haven't actually used it.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.000]   I'm like, this is stupid.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.780]   People say it works,
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.580]   but I just keep it the same temperature
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.900]   throughout the night.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.740]   But warming it up, I guess wakes you up,
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.580]   which is fascinating.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.380]   - Yeah, because the wake up signal is,
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.300]   it's interesting to think about it.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.580]   It's not just correlated
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.020]   with an increase in body temperature.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.860]   The increase in body temperature
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.820]   is triggering the release of cortisol from your adrenals.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.380]   And that's the wake up signal.
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.840]   - Do you think it's absolute temperatures
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.200]   we're talking about is just even relative,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.820]   just even just the decrease?
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.660]   - Well, everyone's gonna have
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.300]   slightly different basal temperature.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.780]   The idea that everybody should be 98.6.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.220]   I mean, that's a myth.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.820]   And there's a theories that body temperature overall
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.020]   has been dropping in the last 50 years or so.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.980]   I doubt that's true for somebody who is athletic like you
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.340]   and is young and healthy.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.340]   But basically the coldest period of that 24 hour cycle
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.820]   is when you are going to be sleepiest.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.220]   There's actually a period within that 24 hour cycle.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.000]   It's a time point called your temperature minimum.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.400]   And your temperature minimum tends to be
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.180]   about two hours before your typical wake up time.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.300]   I'm not talking about the wake up time
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.020]   in the middle of the night where you go use the bathroom
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.580]   or where you set an alarm to go catch a flight.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.200]   I mean, if you were to just allow yourself
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.740]   to sleep without a clock for a few days,
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.260]   measure when you typically wake up,
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.620]   two hours before then is your temperature minimum.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.300]   And that temperature minimum turns out
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.820]   to be a very important landmark in your circadian cycle.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.180]   Because it turns out that if you get bright light
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.740]   in your eyes in the hours immediately
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.500]   before your temperature minimum,
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.180]   so two to four hours or anytime within the two
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.120]   or four hour window before that temperature minimum,
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.340]   you are going to what's called delay your circadian clock.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.060]   The next day, that whole oscillation is going to move forward.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.820]   It'll make you want to go to sleep later
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.980]   and wake up later.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.780]   Whereas if you get bright light in your eyes
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.140]   in the hours after that temperature minimum,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.660]   so let's say for me, typical wake up time is 6 a.m.
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.780]   My temperature minimum is somewhere around 4 a.m.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.560]   If I get bright light in my eyes, 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m.,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.580]   it's going to advance that oscillation
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.260]   so that I'll want to go to bed earlier
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.800]   and wake up earlier the subsequent nights.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.700]   So you might say, wait, but most nights I go to sleep
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.360]   and wake up at more or less the same time.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   Why is that?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.840]   And that's because the same thing
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.980]   is happening on both sides.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.180]   You are both advancing your clock a little bit
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.140]   and assuming that you're looking at light in the evening,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.100]   you're also delaying your clock a little bit.
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.660]   So you get kind of captured in between
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.140]   and then your rhythm more or less oscillates
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.020]   at the same period as we say, as the spin of the earth.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.040]   Unless you're like you where you're,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.120]   I get text messages from you sometimes at odd hours.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.060]   And if you're on the East Coast,
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.180]   then I know that you had to have been pulling
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.020]   basically an all nighter.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:21.180]   That's the interesting point about the messiness of sleep.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.300]   So most people seem to perform the best
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.620]   when they have like a regular sleep schedule.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:32.580]   I perhaps am the same, but I don't know that.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.700]   And I tend to believe that you can also perform
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.860]   relatively optimally with chaos of sleep,
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   of like a weird soup of like,
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.540]   power naps and all nighters and all of that.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.540]   As long as you're like happy doing what you love.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:01.060]   And maybe you can tell me what you think about this.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.540]   I tend to, for myself, try to minimize stress in life.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.540]   So what I found for myself with diet, with sleep,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.420]   is that if I obsess about it being perfect,
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.620]   then I'll actually stress quite a bit when it's not.
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   Like I'll feel shitty when I don't get enough sleep
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.420]   because I know I should be getting more sleep
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.620]   as opposed to the actual physiological effects
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.220]   of not getting enough sleep.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.100]   I find if I just accept whatever the hell happens,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.420]   happens and smile and just take it all in,
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.620]   like David Goggins style, like if it sucks,
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.140]   it's even better or what is it?
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.260]   Jaco's like good or whatever he says.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.380]   - Right, I think that several things that you said
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.760]   they're important, but I agree that one can have
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.780]   a dysregulated sleep schedule
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.380]   and still be a happy person and productive.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.220]   In much of my life, I've pulled all nighters
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.220]   and slept weird schedules.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.520]   I think many people can probably relate to going to sleep,
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.740]   waking up four hours later,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.420]   being up for an hour or two on your computer,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.260]   then going back to sleep and getting amazing sleep
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.860]   the next day functioning.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.020]   I think it's important that people have highlighted
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.880]   the importance of sleep and getting enough rest.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.960]   I do think it's gone too far
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.580]   and now I'm editorializing a little bit,
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.540]   but I think that we've created this anxiety about sleep
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.820]   that if we don't sleep enough, we're going to get dementia.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.100]   If we don't get sleep, then the reproductive axis
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.220]   is going to completely crash.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.380]   There's a lot of evidence to the contrary
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.220]   and as well, just based on personal experience
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.660]   and based on the fact that sure,
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.780]   it may be that a solid eight hours
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.480]   with no interruptions in there or nine or 10
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.460]   could do great benefit, but you can do really well
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.980]   if you do what you say, which is you wake up,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.500]   you don't want to start stressing about it,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.020]   creating this meta stress about sleep.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.220]   Being happy is actually one of the most powerful things
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.700]   that you can do, not allowing yourself
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.740]   to go down that rabbit hole of stress
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.380]   for the following reason, a lot of our fatigue
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.900]   is not due just to the buildup of adenosine or time of day,
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.500]   the circadian thing we were talking about earlier.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.780]   An additional factor is that effort
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.620]   is related to the release of epinephrine,
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.420]   of adrenaline in our brain and body.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.740]   At some point, those levels get so high
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.340]   that we get stressed mentally,
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.420]   we get stressed physically and we want to give up.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.180]   There are good data published in Cell
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.620]   showing that that signal, the epinephrine signal
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.060]   is eventually accumulates and there's a quick point.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.340]   Dopamine, the molecule of pursuit and reward
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.820]   and feeling good, resets our ability to be in effort.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.260]   In fact, a lot of people don't know this,
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.660]   but dopamine is actually what epinephrine is made from.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.260]   If you look at the biochemical cascade,
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.420]   it starts with tyrosine, which is rich
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.220]   and found in red meats and things of that sort.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.200]   And tyrosine is eventually converted
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.460]   through things like L-DOPA into dopamine.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.460]   Dopamine is made into epinephrine.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.780]   So, I mean, this sounds kind of new agey,
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.140]   but happiness, joy and pleasure in what you're doing
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.340]   creates a chemical milieu that provides more
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.820]   of the chemicals that allow for effort.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.260]   And there's nothing new agey about that.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.080]   It's in every biochemistry textbook.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.140]   It's in every decent neuroscience textbook.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.580]   They just don't talk about the happiness part.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.380]   They just talk about the dopamine part.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.420]   So I think that limiting your stress
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.200]   and at least recognizing, okay,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.320]   if you're pulling an all nighter,
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.480]   you're somehow on messed up sleep,
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.360]   that there is going to be a point in that 24 hour cycle
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.060]   where your brain is not trustworthy,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.920]   where your mental state is not worth placing
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   too much weight on because you are near
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.360]   that temperature minimum.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.880]   And near that temperature minimum,
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.200]   which is correlates to that two hour,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.360]   about two hours before you would normally wake up,
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.860]   the brain is hobbling along.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.880]   And anything you feel or think at that time
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.420]   should not be given too much value.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.760]   But if you can trick yourself into thinking
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.260]   that's the pleasure point,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.240]   you afford yourself a huge advantage.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.600]   There's a study done by a colleague of mine at Stanford
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.560]   that showed that positive anticipation
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   about the next day events actually is a powerful metric
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.400]   for creating quality sleep,
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.640]   even if the sleep is very reduced.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.960]   And you'll love this one.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.040]   And a lot of people might be critical of this,
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.940]   so I just want to make sure that,
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.040]   so this is work done out of Harvard Medical.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.760]   It was Bob Stigold's lab,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.960]   and Emily Hoagland did this study that showed
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.840]   looking at performance on OCHEM scores.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.120]   Okay, so organic chemistry at Harvard
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.600]   is pretty tough subject, highly motivated.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.960]   A number of very good control groups in this study.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.920]   What she showed was that consistency
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.720]   of total sleep duration was far more important
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.200]   for performance on these exams
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.800]   than total sleep duration itself.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.720]   So it's not that just getting more sleep
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.280]   allows you to perform better.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.680]   Consistently getting about the same amount of sleep
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.720]   is better for performance, at least on OCHEM,
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.760]   than just getting more.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.600]   - That's interesting.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.800]   So that's referring to more
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.440]   that there should be a consistent habit
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.680]   versus the total amount.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.480]   - To me, the entirety of the picture of sleep
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:36.280]   is similar to nutrition in that it feels like
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.040]   there's so many variables involved,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.400]   and it's so person-specific.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.960]   So a lot of studies, I mean, this is the way of science,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.560]   has to look and aggregate the effects on sleep.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.440]   It doesn't focus on high performers,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.500]   which are individuals, ultimately.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.200]   The question isn't, so it's a very important question,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   is what kind of diet fights obesity, reduces obesity?
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.480]   It's another question, what kind of diet
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.240]   allows David Goggins to be the best version of himself?
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.920]   So these high performers in different avenues.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.020]   And the same thing with sleep.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.600]   People that tell me that I should get eight hours of sleep,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.560]   it's like, I mean, I get it, and they may be right,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.320]   but they may be very wrong.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.480]   - There's no evidence that eight is better than six,
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.440]   that you could very well do better on six than on eight.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.120]   There are a few other things that turn out to be
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.440]   strong parameters for success in this domain.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.160]   For instance, your entire life, waking or asleep,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.760]   is broken up into these 90-minute ultradian cycles.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.520]   If you look at ability to attend or do math problems
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.520]   or do anything, drive, performance tends to ramp up slowly
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.360]   within a 90-minute cycle, peak, and then come down
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.720]   at the end of that 90-minute cycle.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.920]   And in sleep, we go through these stage one, two, three,
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.040]   four, REM, et cetera, we'll talk more about that
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.440]   if you like, those on 90-minute ultradian cycles as well.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.720]   Ending your sleep after a 90-minute cycle,
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.820]   near the end of a 90-minute cycle,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.280]   say at the end of six hours, in many cases is better
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.160]   for you than sleeping an additional hour, seven hours,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.360]   and waking up in the middle of an ultradian cycle.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.200]   And there are a few apps that can measure this
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.240]   based on body movements and things like that,
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.800]   that have your alarm go off
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.880]   at the end of an ultradian cycle.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.480]   And if you wake up in the middle of an ultradian cycle,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.600]   sometimes, not always, you can be very groggy
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.240]   for a long period of time.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.560]   I certainly do better on six hours than I do on seven.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.560]   I happen to like an eight-hour sleep, it feels great,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.020]   but I haven't slept an entire eight hours
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.160]   without waking up in the middle of the night at some point
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.080]   in, I don't know, forever, I can't remember.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.840]   It's probably some point in infancy,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.120]   but, and I function well during the day.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   I think that that's a big,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.220]   that's an important parameter,
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.960]   is how do you feel during the day?
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.040]   Almost everybody experiences some sort of dip in energy
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.000]   in the late afternoon,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.320]   or what would correlate to their temperature peak.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.680]   And that's a good time of day
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.560]   to get either a 90-minute or less nap,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.960]   or if you're not a napper, or you can't nap,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.860]   feet elevated has been shown to be good
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.860]   for clear out of some of this,
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.580]   the glymphatic system is this kind of like
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.740]   sewer system of the brain that you can clear stuff out.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.060]   So legs elevated, or one thing that I'm a big proponent of,
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.220]   and that my lab has been studying,
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.300]   is what I now call NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.340]   And this is just lying down.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.460]   There are some scripts that we're going to put out there soon
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.060]   as a free resource.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.280]   There's some hypnosis scripts
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.820]   that my colleague David Spiegel has put out there
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.100]   as a free resource.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.640]   But non-sleep deep rest is allowing your system
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.940]   to drop into states of real calm
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.500]   that allow you to get better at falling asleep later.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:53.820]   And they can be very restorative
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.620]   for cognitive and motor function.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.060]   There's at least one study out of Denmark
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.340]   that shows that the basal ganglia,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.340]   which is an area of the brain
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.300]   that's involved in motor planning and action,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.380]   one of these 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.260]   resets levels of neuromodulators
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.820]   like dopamine in the basal ganglia
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.220]   to the same levels that they were
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.300]   right after a long night's sleep.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:20.300]   So I also respectfully or semi-respectfully disagree
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.140]   with the idea that you can't recover lost sleep.
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.080]   What does that mean?
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.200]   I mean, there's no IRS for sleep.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.240]   So what does it mean to be in debt for sleep?
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.800]   If you're falling asleep during the day and you're sleepy,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.980]   like you're falling asleep,
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.280]   that's a good sign of insomnia.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.040]   It means you're not sleeping enough at night.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.740]   If you're fatigued during the day,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.240]   but you're not falling asleep,
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.360]   so you're just exhausted,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.560]   but you're not finding yourself falling asleep in meetings
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.080]   and in conversation,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.900]   then chances are you're fatiguing your system
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.860]   through something else,
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.620]   like a long run in the middle of the night in Boston
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.500]   or whatever it is that you're up to lately at 3 a.m.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.040]   - Yes, there is a magic to the nap.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.420]   And maybe you could speak to the,
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.020]   'cause you mentioned these protocols
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.820]   that don't necessarily, so they're non-sleep.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.820]   But to me, the nap, one or two a day,
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.400]   can almost, irrespective of how much sleep
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.760]   I get the night before,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.160]   have a fundamental change in my mood and my performance.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.000]   - For the better?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.040]   - For the better, for the better.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   - Yeah, likewise.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.760]   - So I do tend to kind of experiment with durations.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.520]   It's consistently surprising to me
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.920]   how a nap of 10 minutes, I don't know,
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.680]   maybe you could speak to the perfect duration of a nap,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:43.100]   but I find that it's like magic
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.780]   that a short nap does as much good
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.180]   and often better than a longer one for me, for me.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.020]   Subjective experience.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.980]   - What would be a longer one?
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.380]   Longer than 90 minutes?
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.060]   - No, no, like 90 minutes,
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.060]   but longer than 90, like two hours.
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.220]   - Yeah, that's dropping you,
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.780]   starting to drop you into REM sleep.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.940]   And even if it's a tiny amount of REM sleep,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.700]   people can come out of those naps kind of disoriented.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.460]   I mean, remember in sleep, space and time
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.260]   are totally uncoupled.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.400]   And so that's an odd state to reenter the world in
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.960]   if you're not gonna stay there for a while,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.240]   like for a good night's sleep.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.920]   I think a 20 minute nap is pretty fantastic.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.940]   - Would you say that's the,
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.960]   if you were to recommend to the general,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.720]   it's very weird to recommend anything
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.920]   to the general populace
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.440]   because obviously it's very person specific,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   but what's a good one will you say to friends?
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.560]   Is 20 minutes a good time?
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.120]   - 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.460]   20 or 30 minutes 'cause you're going,
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.400]   unless you're sleep deprived,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.060]   you're going to stay out of REM sleep,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.160]   rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.120]   If you're sleep deprived, you'll drop right into it.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.100]   If you've ever traveled and you're really jet lagged,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.960]   you go to the hotel, you lay down for one second,
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.360]   all of a sudden you're just like,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.460]   you're in a psychedelic dream,
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.120]   which can be pretty great too.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.360]   But I think that 20, 30 minutes,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.840]   and if you can't sleep, some people have trouble napping,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.760]   then learning to relax the body as much as possible,
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.160]   like trying to remove all expression from your face,
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.080]   completely letting your body kind of float.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.360]   If people have a hard time relaxing when they're awake,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.700]   there's some terrific clinically
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.480]   and research tested hypnosis protocols
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.000]   that we could provide links to that are cost-free
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.300]   and that teach you how to just completely
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.000]   release the alertness button and you just start drifting.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.160]   Now, the problem is if you don't have an alarm
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.720]   or something to go off,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.440]   the other day I did one and I'm almost embarrassed
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.680]   to say this, but there's a component of it
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.600]   where you actually are supposed to let your hand float up
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.480]   because it's a hypnosis script.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.680]   So they, it's my colleague, David Spiegel,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.120]   in the script, he says, let your hand float up.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.640]   I woke up an hour later and my hand was still floating.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.680]   - Wow, that's awesome.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.160]   - And I was completely relaxed.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.620]   So hypnosis is just a matter of going deep relaxation,
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.580]   narrowing of context, and it's all self-imposed.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.960]   A lot of people think that hypnosis is like the stage thing
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.880]   with the pendant and the chicken,
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.680]   people fucking like chickens,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.660]   but real hypnosis is self-hypnosis.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.940]   You're learning to, it involves some shifts in the way
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.080]   that you, the hypnotic induction involves looking up,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.760]   closing your eyes, slowly deep breath,
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.200]   and then imagine yourself floating.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.040]   And people vary on a scale of about one to four,
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.640]   four being the most easily hypnotized.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.440]   There are a few people who it's very hard for them
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.920]   to allow themselves to go into these states,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.000]   but for most people, they just, they're gone.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.380]   And it's nice if you can have access to those states,
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.320]   because when you come out of it, you feel amazing.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.720]   You feel like you slept the whole night,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.600]   at least most people report that.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.880]   - So refresh, alert.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.720]   - Ready to go.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.520]   I mean, basically you're ready.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   Yeah, I know you have this interesting challenge coming up,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.640]   and I'm curious what you're going to do to reset in the hours
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.860]   that the frequency of running is every four hours.
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.440]   It's not going to allow you to get any more
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.360]   than a couple hours sleep in between.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.120]   - A couple hours, so we should tell to people,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.800]   I'd be curious to get your thoughts and advice on it.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   I'm on March 5th, running 48 miles with Mr. David Goggins.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.560]   So four miles every four hours, and people should join us.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.280]   That madman is going to be live on Instagram,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.360]   starting at 8 p.m. Pacific on March 5th.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.480]   So-- - You're gonna join him
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.000]   in person? - In person.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.960]   - Undisclosed location. - Undisclosed location.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.720]   And I was trying to clarify, like,
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.840]   okay, so we're gonna, like,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.440]   there'll be like friendly people around or something.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.280]   No, it's just me and him. - Friendly people.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.920]   - I don't know, like, I just feel it's very difficult
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.600]   to be with David alone in a room.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.760]   - I imagine his, I mean, I've done some work with David.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.480]   His energy is infectious.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.160]   - That's an intense schedule,
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   and the periodicity of those four hour,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.920]   every four hours, four miles,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.160]   means that there's no chance
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.800]   of catching an extended block of sleep.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.120]   - So it's about three hours that you have
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.720]   non-exercising every time.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:09.960]   And of course, it takes time to try to fall asleep,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.800]   and there's an intensity to the whole thing.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   I mean, it's probably impossible to get anything more
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.860]   than two hours of sleep if you wanted to.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.200]   So the optimal thing is probably, from the sound of it,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.280]   I'd be curious to see what you think,
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.160]   but like it's getting a few 90 minute naps.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.440]   - Yeah, well, I thought about this a bit
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   before we met up today.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.480]   So I think there are two general approaches that could work,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:40.300]   neither one necessarily better than the other.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.800]   One would be just to hammer through the whole thing,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.160]   just to get your level of alertness and adrenaline
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.480]   ramped up so that you don't expect yourself to sleep.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.680]   There are certain advantages there.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.240]   One is a subjective kind of emotional advantages,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.440]   which is if you can't sleep,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.520]   you're not going to be stressed about that.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.800]   And if you do fall asleep, it's a bonus,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.520]   provided you wake up and you don't look up
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.100]   and you realize David's been out running for half an hour
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.480]   and you're behind, right?
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.120]   But chances are that's not the way it'll go.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.960]   You'll set an alarm.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.920]   So that's one approach.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.280]   And I grabbed that from, you know,
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.920]   I've a couple of friends who were in the SEAL teams,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.400]   and they'll say that, you know, during BUD/S
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.720]   there's this infamous hell week,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.000]   and there's this five day, excuse me,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.060]   definitely five days of no sleep.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.320]   Although there is a component where they offer a nap
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.200]   at one particular point.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.680]   And a lot of people will say that it's worse
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.480]   to go down for that nap and then be woken up
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.080]   20 minutes later than to just stay up.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.620]   So that's one option.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.400]   Let's call it the full blitz hammer through option.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.320]   And if you happen to fall asleep, you do.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.920]   - Bonus, yeah. - It's a bonus.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.880]   The other one would be to really anchor
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   in these ultradian cycles.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.720]   So coming back from a run,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.440]   unless you're thoroughly exhausted,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.880]   you're probably going to have a few minutes
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.760]   where you're going to want to stay awake.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.360]   It's going to be hard to just immediately fall asleep.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.080]   And getting as much sleep as you can
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.120]   in the intervening periods,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.640]   provided that you guys aren't posting constantly
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   or doing something else.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.960]   You also, there's a question of whether or not
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.800]   you want to nourish, whether or not you want to eat
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.560]   or not in that time.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.320]   Anytime we put food in our gut,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   I don't care if it's meat or oatmeal
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.640]   or broccoli or cardboard,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.440]   you're drawing blood into the gut.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.200]   And so you are going to divert some energy
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.320]   towards digestion and it's going to make you sleepy.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.080]   There's a reason why the rest and digest,
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.560]   the parasympathetic nervous system is called that.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.840]   So you could decide that you were only going to sleep
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.720]   in certain, in between certain blocks.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.520]   That would be another way to think about this.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.240]   - That, 'cause I did this last year.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.280]   I ran very slow.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.440]   Some of it was walking.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.520]   I was listening to audio books.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.200]   And one of the biggest mistakes I did
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.120]   is to overeat during that time.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.440]   It was, it made the experience very unpleasant.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.240]   So I have been considering basically eating almost nothing
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.360]   throughout the day.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.520]   - Being fasted will increase alertness
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.960]   because high levels of epinephrine in your system
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.040]   from fasting.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.520]   You just think about fasting or being thirsty
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.800]   before you get exhausted.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.840]   People always think, if I don't eat, I'm going to be tired.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.800]   No, the energy that you derive from food
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.440]   is going to be used from glycogen.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.560]   And after a long storage and conversion process.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.440]   So the food that you eat is going to consume energy
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.720]   to digest.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.880]   And so a lot of people feel better fasted.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.300]   And presumably throughout history,
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.080]   people have fasted for long periods of time
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.740]   and had to stay up for two or three days.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.700]   And God forbid, if a family member is sick,
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.160]   you can stay awake in the hospital without any trouble.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.480]   So that alertness system, and it's all mental.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:45.200]   Actually, and then there's a third.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.040]   So you could try and sleep or take care in between.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.880]   - Yes.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.080]   - Yeah, and then there's a third approach.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.340]   - Uh-oh, yeah.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.440]   - But I didn't come up with it, but David did.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.120]   So I actually texted him earlier
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.880]   because I had a feeling that I heard
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.960]   that you were going to do this challenge.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.660]   So I asked David.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:08.720]   So these are David Goggins words, not mine.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.560]   - Okay.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.400]   - One.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.000]   [laughing]
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Being organized is super important.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.740]   Two, you want to waste as little time as possible.
[00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.400]   Three, you need to eat, sleep, and rehab
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.760]   in as little time as possible
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.000]   so you can sleep as much as possible.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.840]   Oh, interesting.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.320]   By the way, this is the first time I'm reading this.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.920]   - Yeah.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.800]   - Four, meal prep and gear prep, et cetera,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.920]   are very important.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.900]   That's consistent with everything I know about military.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.600]   They don't leave too much to chance.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.520]   Five, again, these are David's words.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.000]   All that said, he's fucked on most all that
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.480]   because he'll be interviewing me before or after.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.600]   I will also be interviewing him.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.260]   - Oh, shit.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.000]   - Five, long story short,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.640]   the only thing that might help is a very special pill.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.520]   Ooh, this is interesting.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.880]   They're called SIU pills.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.120]   Hard to get, but I believe he can get them.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.340]   SIU stands for suck it up.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.800]   Tell him to grab his balls.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.380]   He will find those pills there.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.760]   [laughing]
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.200]   - That's number six, all right.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.720]   - And then the last one, stay hard, brother.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.760]   - Stay hard, brother.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.040]   - Amen.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.120]   That was one of the other things
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.840]   that I think makes this challenging
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.000]   is that I'll be doing a podcast throughout.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.700]   So first of all, I'll do a long one before and after,
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.000]   but also I'll have to come up
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.400]   with things to talk to him about.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   So it's a different thing to do something privately
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.160]   and then publicly.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.080]   I know it doesn't seem that way,
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.580]   but one of the hardest,
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.400]   the hardest thing I had to do last time
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.440]   was to turn on the camera and talk to the camera.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.580]   'Cause last time I did it,
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.880]   I recorded every single time I did a leg,
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.120]   I recorded something I'm grateful for.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.800]   It's just kind of unrelated.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.100]   I'm not a fan of talking about how I'm feeling
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.720]   or how the run is going.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.600]   I wanna do something totally unrelated to the run
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.520]   with the run as the background,
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.240]   sort of something I'm grateful for,
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.760]   just any kind of interesting discussion.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.240]   - Gratitude, I mean, I hate the word hack,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.680]   like, oh, it's a dopamine hack or it's a serotonin.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   I don't like the word hack because A,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.240]   it's disrespectful to hackers who do a real thing.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.600]   And B, a hack implies that it's some sort of trick
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.080]   that you're kind of gaming the system.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.000]   You know, what works is mechanism, right?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.520]   Biological mechanisms were designed to work
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.000]   and they were selected for to work
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.920]   under variable conditions.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.000]   And as you know, and I know,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.360]   and we have great appreciation for the fact
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.860]   that the nervous system was designed
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.320]   to be an adaptive machine
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.720]   so that you don't have to sleep eight hours every night.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.840]   You can do this thing.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.400]   And things like gratitude allow you
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.480]   to tap into chemical resources.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.920]   And that's not a hack.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.360]   The fact that being grateful for something external
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.640]   to the event happens to release serotonin
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.700]   and have a certain soothing effect or dopamine
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.920]   and give you more epinephrine and let you go further,
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.000]   that's not a hack.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.960]   That's actually what allowed the human machine
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.120]   to evolve to the point that it is now.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.760]   Every time, you know, an inventor eventually created
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.680]   something that worked and felt great about it,
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.760]   you can imagine that the first, you know, air flight
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.560]   felt pretty awesome and motivated those people
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.800]   to go on and do more.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.160]   They didn't just go on, you know, yawning, go have a beer.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.960]   So being able to access the genuine internal states
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.780]   of gratitude and reward works.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.560]   You can't trick the system.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.780]   You can't pretend that you're grateful for something.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.720]   But if you can identify or attach yourself
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.180]   to some larger goal or something
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.120]   that's deeply gratifying to you,
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.840]   or place it in service to a relative that passed away
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.480]   that you care a lot about, that's not a hack.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.160]   That's accessing the deepest components
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.360]   of your nervous system.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.480]   And to steal your kind of lingo,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.280]   you know, there's real beauty there, right?
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.680]   (both laughing)
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.920]   - Yeah, but for an introvert like myself,
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.960]   and I think David, I don't know if he's an introvert,
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.760]   but like he's not, despite the fact that he has written
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.720]   a great book and he communicates,
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.840]   he puts himself out there,
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.600]   he's not really a fan of communication.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.260]   He's not, I don't know if he's energized
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.760]   by speaking his mind.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.960]   - I don't know well enough to know.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.800]   I mean, we've done a little bit of work together
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.960]   and we're in communication now and again.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.600]   He's obviously super impressive.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.400]   I don't know.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.900]   It seems like he's a pretty private guy.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.920]   So I don't have access to that.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   - So for me, I'll just speak to myself,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.240]   and I think David is the same,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.200]   but I'll speak to myself that it was a hugely draining thing
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.000]   not to experience the gratitude, experiencing the gratitude,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.040]   just like you're saying is really energizing.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.640]   And it's a powerful thing.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.400]   It can lift up your mood,
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:12.800]   but to turn on the camera and have to use words,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.200]   which is very difficult to do,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.360]   to explain like what you're feeling
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.760]   and do it in a way that you know a bunch of people
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.680]   will be watching is really draining.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.240]   And one of the things I'm concerned about
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.200]   that in this whole process,
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.240]   how do I keep my mind sharp
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.880]   while also keeping the physical performance sharp?
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.040]   And that's a little bit scary
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.680]   because talking to David, like actually intellectually sharp,
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   like thinking, being charismatic as much as I can be
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.320]   and like being still maintaining a sense of humor too,
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:55.720]   'cause I become with sleep deprivation, with exhaustion,
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.840]   you start being-
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.080]   - The Russian bear comes out.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.960]   - You start being such a,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.160]   like I become a David Goggins essentially like-
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.400]   - Oh, it makes you irritable.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.480]   Sleep deprivation makes us irritable.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.400]   - Yeah.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.700]   - It's clear so that in the early part of the night,
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.620]   we get a higher percentage of those old tradian cycles
[00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.280]   are occupied by slow wave sleep,
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.080]   sometimes just called non-REM sleep.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.240]   And those early night sleep bouts
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.600]   are great for muscular repair
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.440]   and for certain forms of learning,
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.940]   but REM sleep, the rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.980]   which it starts to accumulate and occupy
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.340]   more of those 90 minute old tradian cycles
[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.920]   toward the late part of a sleep bout.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.480]   So typically toward morning,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.400]   but after you've been asleep a while,
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.740]   that's when you do the emotional processing.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:46.960]   That's when we recover the ability to feel refreshed
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.440]   and not irritated by things.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.680]   And if you deprive people of REM sleep,
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   they become selectively bad at uncoupling the emotion
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.280]   from things that happened in the previous days.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.640]   So the little things start to seem like big things.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:05.000]   I always know I'm REM sleep deprived when I'm irritable.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.640]   And when I look at like the word the,
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.000]   and it doesn't look like it's spelled right,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.280]   and I'm kind of off about it.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.160]   Like something's off.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.200]   And we actually are becoming slightly psychotic
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.880]   when we're REM sleep deprived.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.720]   You're not gonna get a lot of REM sleep in this thing,
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.000]   except as you fatigue more, if you do fall asleep,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.480]   you're gonna drop more and more into REM
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.140]   so that those 90 minute cycles,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.520]   you won't have to go through stage one, stage two,
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.880]   stage three, and then REM,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.160]   you're just gonna drop right into REM.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.680]   So you can count on your system to compensate for you.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.960]   But I think that just the knowledge
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.440]   that you tend to get irritable as the time goes on,
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.320]   just that third personing of yourself,
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.120]   that awareness, the observer,
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.360]   that can be very beneficial
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.160]   because there may be bouts during this event
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   when you just should probably say nothing.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.440]   And maybe you just, I don't know,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.560]   smile and record or not smile or do whatever it is,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.500]   because you're gonna be conserving energy.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.660]   If it feels like a grind, that's epinephrine being released.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.820]   That's epinephrine that you could devote
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.560]   to the physical effort.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.820]   But humor is an amazing anecdote for this
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.780]   because it resets that, it's that dopamine release
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.060]   that gives us that fresh perspective.
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.340]   And it's a real chemical thing.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.660]   It's not a hack, it's not a trick,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.620]   it's not a visualization, it's biology in action.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.620]   - Well, but I think the act of interviewing,
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.940]   of conversation in these processes,
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.220]   even if you don't wanna do it,
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.540]   the right thing to do, even when you're feeling irritable,
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.220]   is to do the third person view
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.060]   and be able to express with words
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.900]   that you're feeling irritable.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.900]   Like express what you're going through,
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.860]   use words, which I hate doing.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.740]   I honestly, I think my ultimate thing
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:53.620]   would be just to never say a single word to David Goggins
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.300]   and just go through hell.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.240]   It doesn't matter what we do, but to do it quietly,
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.780]   to also express it, that's my ultimate hell.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.380]   - And he's definitely gonna be, if I know David at all,
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.620]   he's going to try and find your buttons.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.820]   Like he's gonna, I mean, he,
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.980]   even though he knows he can complete this,
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.860]   and I believe that he trusts that you can complete it too,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.940]   I believe you can, you will complete it.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.340]   You know you will complete it, right?
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.660]   There's no question about that.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:20.300]   But he's not gonna make it easier for you,
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.380]   he's gonna make it harder.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.460]   - Well, I'm afraid, so I'm like,
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:24.980]   you know, it's very difficult for me.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.900]   So 48 miles is not easy.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.300]   I have not been training that much,
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   so I'm not ramping up, but it's not like going to kill me.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.960]   We'll see what happens.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.260]   Of course, for him, he might almost get bored
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.700]   because I think the 48 miles for him is easy.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.540]   I think--
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.660]   - I don't know that ever gets easy.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.420]   I have a friend, Casey Cordial, who works with David.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   He does some physical rehab type stuff with him.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.940]   And he took Casey on a 50 miler,
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:57.940]   and Casey said it's like 16 miles into it,
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:00.740]   he was just like, he'd hit his wall.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.740]   But he found it, they find it to get, you know,
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.100]   you find that portal.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.500]   There is one thing I want to mention.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.980]   There's some very good physiology
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.940]   that can perhaps support the actual running effort part.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.620]   These are very new data.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.860]   And we have a study going on with David Spiegel at Stanford
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.820]   looking at how different patterns of breathing
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.820]   can affect heart rate variability.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.380]   Heart rate variability is good.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.140]   There's this interesting mechanism
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.020]   that I think most people might not realize,
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.300]   but that medical students learn
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.580]   that your breathing and your heart rate and your brain
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.500]   are in this really remarkable interplay.
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.380]   It goes like this.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.340]   When you inhale, this isn't breath work,
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.460]   we're not going to do breath work.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.860]   But when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.380]   The heart gets a little bigger
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.660]   'cause there's a little more space in the thoracic cavity.
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.220]   And as a consequence, blood flows a little bit more slowly
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.740]   through that larger volume.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.460]   And there's a category of neurons,
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.060]   the sinonatrial node that sees that,
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:59.620]   that recognizes that slower rate through that larger volume.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.980]   It sends a signal to the brainstem
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.740]   and the brainstem sends a signal back to the heart
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.340]   to speed the heart up.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.220]   So every time you inhale, you're speeding the heart up.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.400]   When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.700]   the heart gets a little smaller, the volume is smaller,
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.640]   blood flows more quickly through the heart,
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.860]   signal sent up to the brain,
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.860]   and the brain sends a signal back to slow the heart down.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.580]   This is the basis of heart rate variability.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.260]   So at any point, if you feel like your heart is racing
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.260]   and you feel like you're working too hard
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.420]   per unit of effort,
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.380]   focus on making your exhales longer
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:32.620]   or more intense than your inhales.
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:34.740]   If ever you feel like you're truly flagging,
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.660]   you do not have the energy to get up,
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.440]   it's like, okay, it's time to go and you're exhausted,
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.420]   you want to draw more oxygen into the system,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.380]   get your heart rate going faster.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.180]   Now, some people, when they hear this probably thinking,
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.260]   well, this is really obvious,
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.020]   but there's so much out there about breath work
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.280]   and how to breathe and all this stuff,
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.500]   but no one talks about how to do it in real time
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.860]   while you're exerting effort.
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.940]   - So this is something like almost like second by second,
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.700]   you can adjust things that just in real time
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.740]   based on how you're feeling,
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.220]   but it's based on the heart rate.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.060]   - That's right.
[00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:04.980]   - The variance of the heart rate.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:05.820]   - That's right.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.100]   So one thing that could be very efficient
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.180]   and we're doing some work with athletes now,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.740]   so these are unpublished data,
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.340]   but if you, while you're running,
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.820]   if you want to get into a nice cadence
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.260]   of heart rate variability,
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.060]   do double inhales while you're running.
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.260]   What this will do is that when you do the double inhale
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.700]   has the effect of reopening the alveoli of the lungs,
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.300]   your lungs are filled with tons of little sacks,
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.060]   when you, they tend to collapse as you fatigue,
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.500]   when you, and carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.780]   And that's when we start getting stressed.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   If you've ever been sprinting, you start getting beat
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.220]   and you're going as hard as you can,
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.260]   what you really need to do is double inhale
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.060]   and reinflate these sacks in the lungs
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.180]   and then offload a lot of carbon dioxide.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.740]   So when you're at a steady cadence and you're feeling good,
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.820]   double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.900]   is a terrific way to breathe while you're in ongoing effort.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.100]   - By the way, any recommendations or differences
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.000]   in nose or mouth breathing?
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.860]   - So nasal breathing, there's a lot of excitement now,
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.060]   obviously about nasal breathing
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.340]   'cause of James Nestor's book, "Breath."
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.900]   There was also, if people are going to know about that book,
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:15.660]   that I do feel like out of respect for my colleagues,
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:19.740]   there was a book by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford,
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:20.900]   both professors at Stanford,
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.420]   with a forward by Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.380]   So some heavy hitters in this book.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.860]   And the book is called "Jaws, A Hidden Epidemic."
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.580]   And it's all about how nasal breathing is better for us,
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.140]   especially kids, than being mouth breathers
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.300]   under most conditions for sake of improving immunity.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.240]   It turns out there's a microbiome in the nose,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.500]   like all sorts of good stuff
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.820]   about nasal breathing preferentially.
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:48.620]   But when we exercise, you can do pure nasal breathing,
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.920]   but the problem is once you get up to kind of third
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.740]   and fourth and fifth gear effort,
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.420]   you can't nasal breathe and be at maximum capacity
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.440]   unless you've been training it for a very long time.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.400]   So I would say double inhale through the nose,
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.660]   offload through the mouth.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.780]   So double inhale, exhale while you're in steady effort.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.940]   And then if you really feel like you need to gas it
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.440]   and you're pushing, the data show that then
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:10.820]   just use whatever's there, right?
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.540]   Just go into kind of default mode
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.720]   because bringing too much concentration to something
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.880]   is also going to spend epinephrine.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.380]   The goal is to get into that, I don't like the word,
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.920]   but the flow state where you're not thinking too much,
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.880]   you're just in exertion.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.220]   So these are things that can help in the transitions,
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.600]   but I don't think there's any secret breathing technique.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.780]   Anyone who's been in the SEAL teams will kind of,
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.620]   they'll tell you like,
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.100]   there's no breathing technique, right?
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.380]   There's tools that you can look to from time to time.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.140]   And these double inhale exhales can be great
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.740]   for setting heart rate variability very quickly
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.300]   and getting into a steady cadence while you're exercising.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.340]   But if there's a sprint,
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.980]   like if suddenly you guys are sprinting,
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.880]   ditch the double inhale, exhale and just sprint.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:56.240]   - One thing that you mentioned,
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.540]   he's probably gonna push my buttons.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.200]   It's a good place to ask a question about anger.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.560]   So I'll probably get pissed off at him at some point,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.800]   I'm guessing.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   And do you have thoughts from a scientific perspective
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.600]   or also just the personal philosophical perspective
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   about the role of anger and all of this
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.720]   in managing alertness, performance?
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.800]   - I think about this a lot because there's so much out there
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.040]   about how important it is to do things from a place of love.
[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.000]   - I tweet about it all the time.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.960]   - And I think, and love is powerful, right?
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.880]   It is interesting that autonomic arousal, alertness,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.240]   let's just make use simple language,
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.160]   alertness physiologically looks identical
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   for love and excitement as it does for anger and frustration
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.840]   and wanting to defeat your opponent
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.400]   or whoever that opponent happens to be.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.960]   They're identical, except that the love component
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.600]   does tend to be associated with the release
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.040]   of neurochemicals of the serotonin and dopamine type
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.920]   that do have this replenishment component.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.540]   I don't think one wants to be in constant anger and friction,
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:10.380]   but I mean, I'll come clean a bit.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.600]   There've been portions of my career
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.160]   where some of my best work, my extra two hours,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.720]   my ability to nail a really hard deadline or problem
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.320]   has come from not wanting to get out competed
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.720]   or from wanting to prove something.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.280]   These days, I'm not oriented from that place
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.920]   toward my work quite as often,
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.020]   but I think we should be really honest.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.320]   Anger is powerful, provided it's channeled.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.400]   It's very, very powerful and it can give you a ton of fuel
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.700]   and gas to push when otherwise you'd tap.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:49.480]   - Yeah, Joe Rogan has, aside from being a fan of his,
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   has been an inspiration to sort of be,
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.760]   to have a kind of loving view on the world
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.240]   in the way he approached the world, to me.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.840]   So I've tended to want to approach the world that way,
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.200]   but in the same way, David Goggins has been an inspiration
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:11.200]   to like, yeah, be angry at stuff and use it as fuel.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:17.740]   Like he almost conjures up artificial demons in his mind
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.140]   just so he can fight them.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.500]   But at the same time, I tried that
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.700]   'cause I did a challenge in the summer of,
[00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:27.940]   well, for 30 days, I was doing a lot of pushups
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.940]   and it was, over time, it was counterproductive for me.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.380]   I found that it was easier to just,
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:42.140]   like the rollercoaster that the emotional,
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.440]   like being angry at stuff takes you,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:46.280]   can also be exhausting.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.440]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:51.060]   - And it can take you down, like the ups of it are good,
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.140]   but the downs are bad.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:56.080]   And what I found is better to get,
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.840]   to use it as a boost every once in a while,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.660]   but mostly to get lost in the,
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.280]   you're talking about the breath work,
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.380]   like getting lost in the ritual of it,
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.240]   like the beat, like that,
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.920]   as opposed to going on the big rollercoasters of emotion.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.320]   - Yeah, this brings us into the realm of neuroendocrinology.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.980]   There's a fascinating relationship
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.260]   between the hormone system and the nervous system.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.080]   And hormones work in general on slower timescales.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.420]   The definition of a hormone is something,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.480]   is a chemical released at one location in the body,
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.260]   goes and acts at multiple locations far away
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.100]   within the body.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.840]   Pheromone would be between two bodies.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.900]   Neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.000]   tend to work a little more quickly.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.340]   There are hormones like adrenaline and cortisol
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.440]   that can work very fast,
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.760]   but here I'm referring mainly to testosterone,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.540]   prolactin, prolactin tends to be in men and women,
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.340]   tends to make people kind of lazy
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.740]   and want to take care of young.
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:52.640]   It tends to throw down body fat so we can stay up late.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.940]   It's secreted in response to having children.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.220]   These are all in humans and in animals.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.860]   There's a very interesting relationship
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.780]   between testosterone and dopamine
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:07.580]   that speaks directly to what we're talking about now.
[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.840]   So dopamine and testosterone are closely related
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.320]   in the pituitary system.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.800]   And obviously testosterone comes from the adrenals
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.440]   and from the testes.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.920]   But the major effect of testosterone
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.840]   is to make effort feel good.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   That's what testosterone does.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.800]   It has other effects too, right?
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.680]   Reproductive effects, androgenizing parts of the body,
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.560]   et cetera, but it makes effort feel good.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.180]   The testosterone molecule is synthesized from cholesterol.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:41.220]   Cholesterol can either be made into cortisol,
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.900]   a stress hormone, or testosterone, but not both.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.580]   So you have a limited amount of cholesterol
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:49.020]   and it gets diverted towards stress
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.040]   or this pathway where effort feels good.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.300]   That's the pathway you want to get into.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.340]   The anger pathway,
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:00.260]   if we were to just kind of play a mind experiment here,
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.640]   the anger eventually is going to divert
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.340]   more of that cholesterol molecule to cortisol and stress,
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:08.740]   and you will be slowly depleting testosterone.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.860]   Now going into this, you'll have plenty of testosterone,
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.320]   but after a couple of days,
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.900]   there've been very interesting studies
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.700]   showing that testosterone doesn't necessarily drop
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.140]   with sleep deprivation.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.340]   That's a bit of a myth.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.020]   You need it to replenish,
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:24.480]   you need sleep to replenish testosterone eventually.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.820]   But the real question is,
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.940]   are you enjoying what you're doing?
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:29.980]   And here that the work was,
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.320]   some of the major work on this was done by Duncan French,
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:34.880]   who runs the UFC Training Center.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.640]   He did his PhD at Yukon stores,
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.040]   did a really beautiful PhD thesis
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.080]   looking at the relationship between stress hormones,
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.560]   testosterone, and dopamine.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.920]   Really interesting work.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.240]   And the takeaway from all of this is,
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.280]   if you can just convince yourself,
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.400]   or ideally, if you can just enjoy yourself,
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.820]   you are going to maintain
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.400]   or maybe even increase testosterone stores,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.560]   which will make effort feel good.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.360]   And to me, aside from neuroplasticity,
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.480]   where everything becomes automatic after this experience,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.880]   to me, that's the Holy grail.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.700]   When effort feels good, life just gets way better.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.800]   And we're not talking about achieving the reward.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.480]   I'm not talking about the end of this thing.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.600]   I'm talking about the process of it feeling really good.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.640]   - Yeah, there is a magic to,
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.720]   I don't know if you can comment on this,
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.080]   but I find myself being able to,
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.120]   if I just say I'm feeling good,
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:34.880]   like this old hack of smiling while you're running.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.560]   If I just tell myself I'm feeling really good right now,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.760]   no matter how I'm actually feeling,
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.080]   I'll start feeling way better.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.160]   And the whole thing, there's a cascading effect
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.840]   that allows me to maximize the effort.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.400]   It's quite fascinating.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.540]   It's weird.
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.860]   - Hormones are powerful.
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.840]   The relationship between thoughts and hormones
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.080]   and these physiological things is enormous.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.880]   I had a colleague that a few years ago,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.520]   he was dying of pancreatic cancer.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.040]   And I was interviewing him
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.680]   just 'cause he's an important figure in our community.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.040]   And I was a friend.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.400]   And there was one day where he told me,
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.800]   he said, "I don't want to make it past the new year."
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.080]   And it was crushing for me to hear.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.680]   And I knew that he had been on some androgen therapy
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.160]   for a whole set of other things.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:24.700]   And I said, "Have you taken your androgen cream?"
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.840]   And he was like, "No, I haven't done it.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.280]   Go get it for me."
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.240]   I have this on film.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.120]   He takes it, he puts the androgen cream on.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.140]   I'm not suggesting people take androgens, by the way.
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.760]   10 minutes later, he says, "You know what?
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.560]   I think I want to live into the new year.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.880]   And I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation."
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:41.200]   He went to MIT, by the way.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.880]   He said, "I'm going to write 12 letters of recommendation."
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.720]   And he did.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:47.160]   And so there's something about these molecules
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:50.480]   that in an ancient way, in all organisms,
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.720]   all mammals, as far as we know,
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.760]   are linked to the will to live.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.520]   They're linked to effort and making effort feel good,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:00.400]   which has been fundamental to the evolution of our species.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:01.240]   I always say,
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.960]   people think that the opposite of testosterone is estrogen,
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.000]   but it's not.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.400]   The opposite of testosterone is prolactin,
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.040]   which makes us feel quiescent
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.240]   and not in pursuit of things, et cetera.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:14.680]   Testosterone makes effort feel good.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.020]   Estrogen makes emotions feel okay.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.160]   [laughing]
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.880]   And they are in mixed amounts.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.920]   People, as I say, have all chromosomal backgrounds.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.160]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.560]   - I mean, you also mentioned fasting potentially
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   through this two-day thing.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.040]   It'd be cool to get your thoughts about fasting in general.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.320]   Do you think, on a personal level
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.120]   and at a higher sort of level of studies
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.560]   that you're aware of and physiology and so on,
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.420]   what do you think about intermittent fasting
[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.760]   of like not eating for 16 hours
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.600]   and then having an eight-hour window
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.560]   or something I've been doing a lot recently,
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   which is eating only once a day.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.640]   So that's 24-hour fast, I guess, one meal a day.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.040]   Or something I've been thinking about doing,
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.680]   haven't done yet, of doing like 72 hours.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:11.440]   And some people do like five-day fasts in general.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.600]   So this would be, for this particular run,
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   would be a 48-hour fast if I don't eat at all.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.780]   What do you think about that for performance,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.920]   for mood, for all those kinds of things?
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.700]   - I can speak a little bit to the science
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.300]   and a little bit of my own experience
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.620]   and then some anecdotes of people that have done
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.460]   very hard, very long-duration things
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.280]   and what they've told me.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.220]   So I just want to make sure I'm separating those out
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.140]   so people know my sourcing.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.420]   I think, now, none of this is about
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.760]   the actual long-term nutritional benefits
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.560]   of one thing or the other.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.340]   But if you look at the science on intermittent fasting,
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.140]   it's pretty remarkable.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.100]   Before I was at Stanford, my lab was in San Diego.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.300]   One of my colleagues was Sachin Panda
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.380]   at the Salk, is phenomenal biologist and researcher.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.940]   Wrote a book called "The Circadian Code."
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.780]   It's very, very good.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.520]   And kind of popularized intermittent fasting,
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:01.460]   although there were others that had talked about this
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.240]   before, Ori Hoffmechler talked about the warrior diet.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.860]   People probably might not know who Ori is,
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.160]   but he's sort of the originator of this business
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.540]   of intermittent fasting, eating once a day or limited.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.040]   Anyway, Sachin has published papers, peer-reviewed papers
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.920]   in very good journals like "Cell" and elsewhere,
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.200]   showing that limiting the consumption of calories
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.820]   to eight, four, six, or eight, or even 10 hours
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.000]   of every 24-hour cycle, and keeping that more or less
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.180]   correlated with the light, with when the sun is out,
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.580]   leads to less liver disease, improved metabolic markers,
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.720]   less body fat, et cetera.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.800]   In the mouse studies, they even gave the mice the choice
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.780]   to eat whatever they wanted, as much as they wanted,
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.180]   as long as they restricted it to a certain period
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.860]   of within the 24-hour cycle, they did great.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.740]   They maintained a healthy weight or even lost weight.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.380]   When they took the same amount of food
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.340]   and they stretched it out across the entire 24-hour cycle,
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.320]   so this is eating every hour or two hours,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.300]   the animals got fat and sick.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.540]   So it's pretty remarkable data.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   How much of that translates to humans isn't clear,
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.060]   but one thing that's really clear with humans is adherence.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.880]   Right, we could talk a lot about nutrition
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.180]   and some of the problems with the studies on nutrition
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180]   is that what people will do in a laboratory
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.600]   is often hard to do in the real world.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.380]   Low-carbohydrate diets, just they tend,
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   because they tend to focus on foods
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.980]   that have high amino acid content, like meats,
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:29.800]   generally people are less hungry on those
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.560]   than they are on calorie-matched diets
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.740]   of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates,
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.820]   because when the insulin goes up,
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.520]   you get hungry and you want to eat more.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.700]   So this is not a push for carnivore
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.540]   or a push against one thing or the other,
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.140]   it's just there are a lot of factors.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.460]   But we know for sure that when you're fasted
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.620]   or when you have low amounts of carbohydrate
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.640]   in your system, complex carbohydrate,
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.420]   your alertness is going to go up.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.000]   Fast increases alertness and epinephrine
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.780]   for the sole purpose of getting you to go out and find food.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.980]   Can you imagine if our ancestors got hungry
[01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.260]   and they were like, "Oh, I'm too tired to go find food,"
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.220]   we wouldn't be here.
[01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:12.020]   It'd be like robots or some, one of your alien buddies
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.940]   will be like running the planet.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.700]   So I think that if you want to be alert,
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.580]   fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.100]   to a minimum is very valuable.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.540]   If you want to sleep and you want to be sleepy,
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.380]   ingesting foods that have a lot of tryptophan,
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.920]   which is the precursor to serotonin,
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.300]   so complex carbohydrates like rice and grains,
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.660]   turkey, white meats,
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.700]   those things do create a sense of sleepiness.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.220]   However, there is a caveat,
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.780]   and this is one problem with the once a meal,
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.380]   once a day meal,
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.180]   is that anytime you have a lot of food in the gut,
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.620]   you're increasing sleepiness
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.680]   because you're diverting blood to the gut.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.740]   It's going to trigger the vagus to signal to the brain
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:53.540]   to shut down your system and utilize those nutrients,
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.300]   digest and utilize those nutrients.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.160]   So I've done the once a day eating thing.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.220]   The problem is I eat so much in that meal that I'm exhausted.
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.740]   And so it doesn't always lend itself well to the schedule.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.980]   But so in a six or eight hour eating block
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.060]   for me is a little bit better.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.220]   I do eat carbohydrates.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.460]   I'm probably one of the few people left
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.740]   on the West Coast that actually consumes carbohydrates
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:15.580]   and will say that out loud.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.220]   - I don't know people who eat carbs anymore.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.060]   That's weird.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.880]   - They don't.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.020]   - Where do you even find carbs these days?
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:20.860]   - I like oatmeal.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.680]   I like rice.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.260]   The other time is if people are doing
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:24.740]   very high intensity weight train,
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.420]   they need to replenish glycogen.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.740]   - On the alertness side,
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.160]   I do feel like it's probably person dependent.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.600]   For me, alertness,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.580]   being alert makes my life better in a lot of ways,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.780]   more than just the alertness itself.
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:40.220]   Like for example,
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.100]   one of the things I discovered with fasting
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.540]   is that when I was training twice a day in jiu-jitsu,
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.820]   for example, and competing and so on,
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.460]   I performed way better at things
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.940]   that you traditionally would say you need carbs for,
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.040]   which is explosive movements and all that.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.180]   I don't know if I actually perform better
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:05.180]   in terms of like the force of the explosion,
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.900]   the explosiveness.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.700]   What I do know is the alertness resulted
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:13.500]   in me doing the technique more precisely.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.180]   That's the dopamine and epinephrine system in action.
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:23.060]   There are some other just purely physical aspects
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.940]   to one diet versus the other that can be complicated.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.620]   If you're ingesting carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates,
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.060]   you're going to replenish glycogen, which is great,
[01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:33.500]   but they also tend to be bulky and fibrous.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.340]   And I've never rolled jiu-jitsu,
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.860]   but running when you have a lot of bulky, fibrous food
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.180]   in your gut or in your intestine, it can be a barrier.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.580]   It can be uncomfortable.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.260]   And so some people do really well
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.220]   on low carbohydrate, meat-rich diets
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.380]   because they're just not as bloated.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.460]   They're not carrying as much water and other stuff.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:54.180]   Carbohydrate carries a lot of water molecules with it.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.020]   So there are aspects to being able to train
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.180]   and being really explosive 'cause you feel light.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.180]   One anecdote that really, again,
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.560]   I'm not encouraging any one particular kind of diet,
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.140]   but I have a friend who is in the SEAL teams.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.760]   I happen to know a number of people in that community.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.420]   And he told me that he did this very long fast.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.620]   It was a fast that I think you get to eat
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.460]   a little bit of soup or broth,
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.920]   and there's like a bar or something,
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.720]   but it's like a nine-day thing.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.280]   And he's a very strong athlete.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.680]   And he said that on day six or seven,
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.300]   he was running up some hills or something
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.480]   while he was on deployment, and he felt amazing.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.080]   He had kind of hit this other level.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.280]   He was somebody who had boxed in the Naval Academy.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.280]   He was somebody who knows a new high output.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.700]   And he felt like he discovered the 13th floor,
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.660]   that there was another floor to this performance space
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.560]   that he hadn't experienced except while he had fasted.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.640]   And he said that that was a remarkable clarity of mind,
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.480]   energy, it's a little bit of what you described.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.160]   He described a kind of suppleness and explosiveness.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.400]   So there's probably something there.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.000]   - On which day?
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   - At once he was in the fifth or sixth day of the fast.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.360]   - See, this is the thing is I've never been there
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.840]   on the second, third, fourth, fifth day,
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.920]   that kind of thing.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.860]   But when I just don't eat for 20 hours,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.840]   many times through my training, the clarity,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.200]   it's like you feel like everyone is moving super slowly,
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.520]   and you're able to like dominate people
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.920]   you weren't able to before.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.240]   It's like-- - Well, you might have
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:32.520]   slipped into or switched over rather into full ketosis.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.400]   And ketogenic diets done properly can be great for people.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.480]   The problem is if you do it wrong, you can really mess it.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.880]   I tried it once and I basically got psoriasis.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.400]   I thought my scalp was gonna fall off.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.120]   I was like sloughing off all this.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.160]   And then I stopped and I was taking the liquid ketones.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   And then all of a sudden I felt better again.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.980]   But I was told that I just did it wrong.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.320]   That's so I think there's a right way and a wrong way
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.760]   and you have to get it right.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.240]   - Definitely, and so I've experimented quite a bit
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.360]   with keto to see how my body feels
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.720]   and doing it the right way and following all the instructions
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.080]   that there's definitely a huge difference.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.440]   For example, one of the things I discovered,
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.880]   everyone know who said this, but I tried this recently
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.200]   over the past year is I started drinking,
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.640]   when I don't feel great, if I'm fasting, bone broth,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.000]   chicken bone broth.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.680]   And for some reason, like magically, it could be,
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.460]   this is the other thing, the mind, I don't know,
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.920]   but it makes me feel really good.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.840]   - Well, it could be the salt.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.560]   So I mean, neurons, the action potential neurons,
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.380]   as you know, is sodium is rushing into the cell.
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.760]   You need enough extracellular sodium
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.280]   in order for your brain and nervous system to function.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.780]   And so salt, I mean, unless people have hypertension,
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.620]   salt is great.
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.080]   There was an article in Science Magazine about a decade ago
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.880]   about how salt had been demonized.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.400]   And unless people have hypertension,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.600]   provide you drink enough water, salt is great.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.800]   You need sodium, magnesium, and potassium to function
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.300]   and for your nerve cells to work.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.960]   I mean, people who over drink water
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.880]   and don't consume enough electrolyte die.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.640]   Now, hydration is really important.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.280]   I know David's really into hydration.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.480]   He's mentioned that a few times.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.400]   I mean, hydrating properly is key.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.920]   And so you definitely want to make sure
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.280]   that you're drinking enough water
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.320]   and getting enough electrolytes.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.200]   We should have actually talked about that at the beginning
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.040]   because that's going to keep your nervous system
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.440]   functioning well.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   And a lot of people, they'll get shaky or jittery.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.920]   And when they're fasting and they'll think they need sugar.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.000]   And if they just put some salt in some water,
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.960]   they feel fine.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.240]   - And like the other stuff, potassium, magnesium,
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.680]   whatever the other electrolytes are, but yeah.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.520]   - Yeah, those three.
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.040]   So I mean, salt, yeah.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.680]   Magnesium's good before sleep.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.400]   Salt, I mean, this is a vast space.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.720]   And we're kind of talking about the overlap
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.160]   between neurochemicals, hormones, and nutrition.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.760]   And it's a fascinating space.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.560]   And it's one that the academic community has gems
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.640]   within the textbooks.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.800]   It hasn't really made it into the public sphere yet.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.720]   And I think that's because people get so caught up
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.520]   in the, you know, being, are you vegan or are you carnivore?
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.920]   And there's a vast space in between too
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.800]   that people can explore.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.400]   Like I'm not a competitive athlete, so I eat meat
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.820]   and I also eat vegetables and I eat fruits.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.360]   And it's just about timing them.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.280]   But I tend to eat carbohydrates when I want to be sleepy.
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.120]   I eat them at night.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.760]   And everyone said, that's the worst thing.
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   You can't do that.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   You sleep great after eating a big bowl of pasta,
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.720]   I'll tell you.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.680]   - And by the way, I should give you a big thank you
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.360]   for connecting me with Belcampo Farms.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.960]   They sent me some meat, I think because of you.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.160]   (laughing)
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.400]   And it's delicious.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.200]   So I really appreciate that.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.160]   I mean, it also connected me with this whole world
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.840]   of people who are doing farming in this ethical way
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.080]   and like really love the whole process.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.560]   And like, and as from a both like a human level,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.500]   but also scientific level and the result is,
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:57.760]   it's like ethical, but also it's delicious.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.360]   And it makes you think about your diet
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.840]   in a whole new kind of way.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.520]   - Yeah, I've known, I don't have any commercial relationship
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.000]   to Belcampo, so I can be very clear.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.880]   I've known Anya Fernald, who is the founder
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.800]   and CEO of Belcampo.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.600]   I've known her since the ninth grade.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.200]   It is true that her parents are faculty members at Stanford.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.320]   They're colleagues of mine,
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.780]   but she's just a serious academic of nutrition,
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:21.320]   but also of sustainable agriculture,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.760]   of all sorts of things.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.400]   And also the meat just, it's awesome.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.220]   It tastes really good.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.840]   And no, I'm not getting paid to say that.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.040]   No, they're not sponsoring my podcast.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.200]   It's just, I feel like if you're gonna eat animals,
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.140]   if that's in your framework and you're gonna eat animals,
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:39.400]   knowing that the animals were raised as happy as could be
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.680]   until time of slaughter is at least important to me.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.280]   - And actually talk to her.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.680]   So I will talk to her on this podcast actually.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:52.240]   And she invited me like a week ago out to visit the farm
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.440]   in May or June or whatever.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.960]   - Yeah, they have the farm up at the Oregon border.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.760]   I haven't been there yet, but I've seen the pictures.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.840]   And it's just beautiful. - It looks awesome.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.600]   And I was like, yes.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.440]   - It looks beautiful.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.420]   Let me know when you're going.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.320]   - Yeah, let's go together.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.360]   - You'll probably run there, but I'll drive there.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.800]   - Yeah, but all that said, I do want to,
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.600]   'cause a lot of people who are vegan write to me,
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.720]   and I do want to seriously,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.280]   in the same seriousness that I approached keto,
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.000]   I do want to go on a few months
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.400]   to switch to a vegan diet at some point to really try it.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   - I haven't done it yet
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.000]   'cause I'm afraid I'm gonna function better.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   (laughing)
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.200]   I'm Argentine by my dad's side.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.680]   And I don't eat meat super often,
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.920]   but well, for most people it would seem often.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.700]   But I do love steak, I do.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.960]   So I'm afraid I'm gonna feel better.
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.840]   - There's a social element to steak, you're right,
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.400]   'cause coming from a Russian background,
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.280]   I can't imagine going to visit my folks,
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.200]   like my parents for Thanksgiving or something,
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.200]   and say, "Mom and dad, I don't eat meat."
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:58.000]   - Well, I think if you're gonna eat meat,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.960]   getting it from sources that are compatible
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.200]   with continuation of the planet is good.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.200]   I mean, there are some real problems
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.600]   with the factory farm meat.
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.000]   You drive up and down the five and you pass that point
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.360]   where there are all those cows.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.220]   I mean, as somebody who loves animals,
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:21.220]   it's clear that you wanna limit the amount of suffering
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.200]   of those animals.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.940]   Whenever I hear about, we know people that hunt
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.160]   and that go and get their own meat, I really admire that.
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.080]   I admire that people do that.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.520]   We don't tend to do that in the hills around Stanford.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.420]   There are mountain lines back there, but that's about it.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:40.260]   And I'm certainly, I admire the vegan mindset
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.860]   of just making that decision.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.140]   You're just not gonna consume other beings,
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.960]   but I haven't gone that way.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.000]   - For performance-wise, I'm just curious
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.920]   because I was surprised.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.260]   I was certain that eating five, six, seven meals a day
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:58.860]   is the right thing to do if you wanna perform your best
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.160]   when I was like 20 or whatever.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.660]   And I would eat oatmeal.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:05.540]   Like I thought it's obvious I have to have a really,
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.880]   a lot of carbs in the breakfast.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:08.920]   I had a lot of preconceived notions.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.200]   And then when I started eating like once a day,
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.800]   this was at the peak of my competing in jujitsu,
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.100]   it was like everything I know about nutrition is wrong.
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.720]   You realize that you have to become a scientist.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.360]   First of all, you have to read literature,
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.040]   you have to learn, you experiment,
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:29.120]   but you also have to become a scientist of your own body.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.080]   In the same way, I have a lot of preconceived notions
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.440]   of what performance is like under a vegan diet.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.960]   And I want to do it right, like seriously,
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.200]   not necessarily for the ethical reasons,
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.440]   but to see if it's performance-wise.
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.740]   Like can I, I remember there's like a fruitarian diet
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.820]   where you eat fruit only.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.500]   These extremes are like, they're pretty,
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.420]   they're interesting 'cause people have this need.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.200]   The extremes are informative though, right?
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.820]   I mean, well-controlled experiments,
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.740]   you eliminate as many variables as you can
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.020]   except the one you're interested in.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.500]   So people are running these experiments.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:09.460]   I think that it's hard to imagine getting,
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.540]   I know people say you can get enough amino acids
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.200]   from plant-based sources, and I believe that.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.500]   I think it probably takes a little more work.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.640]   One thing that's really clear is that the benefit
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.200]   of these omega-3, omega-6 ratios,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.840]   like fish oils and things like that.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.660]   There are some data that show that the,
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.100]   getting at least a thousand milligrams of the EPA,
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.240]   which is high in fish oils, but other things too,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.520]   even some meats and other plants,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:40.120]   in double, in matched placebo,
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.840]   double-blind controlled studies,
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.400]   placebo-controlled double-blind studies
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.080]   have shown that those can offset antidepressive symptoms
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.300]   as much as some of the selective serotonin
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.400]   reuptake inhibitors like Prozac and Zoloft.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.420]   So that's pretty impressive.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:57.640]   And in Scandinavia, people know, especially in winter,
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.320]   to consume a lot of those omega-3s
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.000]   because they're good for you, they're good for the brain.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.880]   - That's the other question.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.320]   Nutrition-wise, what kind of stuff have you come across
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.160]   that's useful?
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.440]   Like I basically only take fish oil,
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.120]   like you said, electrolytes.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.200]   Electrolytes with water, the David Goggins diet.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.040]   - Fish oil.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:19.960]   - Plus fish oil.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   And then again, the sponsor, they made it so easier.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.640]   The sponsor of your podcast and mine,
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.840]   athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.400]   - Great stuff. - Support it.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.560]   I don't know, like it's great stuff for sure,
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.700]   but also just takes away the headache of like,
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.840]   I don't have to think about.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.280]   - Yeah, you're going to get a bunch of vitamins and minerals.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.360]   It does that.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.280]   It sounds like a plug,
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.520]   but I have genuinely been buying it.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.560]   No discount, no affiliation or anything since 2012.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.360]   I think I heard about it on the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.000]   I was like, oh, I'm going to try that stuff.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.840]   And I liked it.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:54.220]   I mean, when I was starting my lab,
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.200]   I was working insane hours.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.960]   I still work very long hours.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.960]   And getting sick limits productivity.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.240]   And I also wanted to train
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.800]   and I wasn't doing much training back then.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.720]   Now I try and get three, four sessions in a week.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.900]   I'm not doing nothing like what you and David are doing
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.640]   or what Joe does.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.680]   Or like you guys are way more regimented
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:16.940]   and consistent than I am.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:21.280]   But I think that being healthy and feeling good
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.160]   is one of the great benefits to a career
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.140]   is having energy and just being not sick.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.000]   - Can we take a step back to sleep for a little bit?
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   And so people should definitely look through your podcast
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.680]   the first five episodes were on sleep.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.960]   Or no, I guess the first opening episode wasn't.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.180]   - First one was sort of how the brain works generally.
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:47.960]   It was to give people some background.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.280]   And then we did four episodes on sleep.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.640]   Including some stuff about food, temperature, exercise,
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.120]   jet lag, shift work for the jet lag folks and shift workers.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.600]   - Yeah, it's like a masterclass on sleep.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.840]   And then you're going on to a next topic
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.280]   in the next few episodes, which is incredible.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.840]   Well, neuroplasticity, we'll talk about it.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.360]   But on sleep, one of the cool things
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.740]   about the human mind when it sleeps is dreaming.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.340]   What do you think we understand
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.040]   about the contents of dreams?
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.740]   Like what do dreams mean?
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.400]   All the stuff we see when we dream.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.720]   Is there something that we understand
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.060]   about the contents of dreams?
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.520]   - Some of it is very concrete.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   So Matt Wilson, who MIT, showed in rodents
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.600]   and it's been shown in non-human primates.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.840]   And now it's been shown in humans
[01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.840]   that there is replay of spatial information during sleep.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:49.360]   So initially what Matt showed was
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.980]   that as these little rodents navigate through a maze,
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.320]   there are these cells in the hippocampus called place cells
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:58.760]   that fire when the animal encounters a turn or a corridor.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.720]   And that same exact same sequence is replayed during sleep.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.480]   And it turns out this is true in London taxi cab drivers.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.060]   Before phones and GPS were what they are today,
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.400]   the London taxi cab drivers were famous
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.880]   for knowing the routes through the city,
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.720]   through these mental maps and their analysis
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.640]   of their place cell firing during sleep
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.680]   and during wakefulness.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.620]   And so we are essentially taking spatial information
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.160]   about the location of things and replaying it during sleep.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.280]   However, it's not replayed so that you remember it all.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.280]   It's replayed so that if there's a reason to remember it,
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.080]   the links to the emotional system,
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.960]   to the components of the limbic system and hypothalamus
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.440]   that are relevant, like you got into a car crash
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.600]   or a particular location, or you lost a bunch of money
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.800]   because you were a cab driver, Uber driver,
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.760]   we'd say nowadays, and you were stuck
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:53.400]   at one particular avenue all day and frustrated.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.320]   You were getting yelled at by your spouse.
[01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.000]   That information gets encoded so that you never forget
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.440]   that at that particular time of day
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.200]   and that particular time of year
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.220]   and this thing happened.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:06.720]   So context starts getting linked to experience.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.360]   So there's spatial information
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.720]   that's absolutely replayed during sleep.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.460]   And we experienced this sometimes as dreams.
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:15.200]   The dreams that happen early in the night
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.520]   when slow wave sleep or non-REM sleep dominates,
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:22.440]   tends to be sleep of very kind of general themes
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.640]   and kind of location.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:27.880]   It can feel a little bit eerie and kind of strange.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.100]   Not so incidentally, the early phase of the night
[01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.320]   is when growth hormone is released.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.180]   In the '80s and '90s, there was a drug
[01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.080]   that was very popular.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.340]   It's very legal now called GHB.
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:41.620]   You could actually buy it at GNC or a store then.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.840]   I never took it, but it was a popular party drug.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:47.960]   And some people, some famous celebrities died while on GHB.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.400]   They were also on a bunch of other things.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.480]   So it's not clear what killed them,
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.080]   but GHB was very big in certain communities
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.720]   'cause it promoted a massive release of growth hormone
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.920]   and gave people these very hypnotic states.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.040]   So people would go to clubs
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.880]   and they were in these very hypnotic states.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.220]   It was part of a whole culture.
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.160]   That's early night.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.920]   And those dreams tend to not have
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.720]   a lot of emotional content or load.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.040]   That phase of dreaming is associated
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.320]   with the occasional jolting yourself out of sleep
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.560]   'cause it's a somewhat lighter sleep.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.440]   The dreams that occur during REM,
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.640]   during rapid eye movement sleep
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:26.520]   and that dominate towards morning are very different.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:30.000]   They tend to have very little epinephrine
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.040]   is available in the brain at that time.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.400]   Epinephrine again being this molecule
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.240]   of stress, fear, and excitement.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:38.120]   You are paralyzed during these REM dreams.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.800]   You cannot move.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:44.520]   There's intense emotion at the level of what you're feeling
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.000]   and there's so-called theory of mind.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.880]   Theory of mind is an idea that was put forward
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:52.480]   by Simon Baron Cohen, Sasha Baron Cohen's cousin.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.320]   I think on the podcast,
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.800]   I mistakenly said that he was at Oxford.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.880]   It's like the Cardinal sin.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.320]   He's at Cambridge, forgive me.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.600]   I'm not British, but.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.900]   So the dreams in REM are heavily emotionally laden.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.840]   And it's very clear that those dreams and REM sleep,
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.600]   if you deprive yourself of them for too long,
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.080]   you become irritable and you start linking
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.400]   generally negative emotions to almost everything.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.820]   The dreams that occur in REM sleep
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:21.800]   are when we divorce emotion from our prior experiences.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.020]   And it's when we extract general rules and themes.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:27.500]   MIT seems to come up a lot today,
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.340]   but it's highly relevant.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.860]   Susumu Tonogawa, Nobel Prize for immunoglobulin,
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:36.080]   but obviously fantastic neuroscientist as well,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.900]   has shown that the replay of neurons in the hippocampus
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.220]   and elsewhere in the brain is kind of an approximation
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:44.260]   of the previous episode.
[01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:48.540]   And a lot of fear unlearning of uncoupling emotion
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.780]   from hard or traumatic events that happened previously
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.280]   occurs in REM sleep.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.060]   So you don't want to deprive yourself of REM sleep
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:55.980]   for too long.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.700]   And those dreams tend to be very intense.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.500]   Now, epinephrine is low so that you can't suddenly
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.280]   act out your dreams.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.620]   But what's interesting is sometimes people will wake up
[01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:08.520]   suddenly while in a REM dream and their heart
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.460]   will be beating really, really fast.
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.580]   That's a surge of epinephrine that occurs
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.860]   as you exit REM sleep.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:16.920]   So you were having this intense emotional experience
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.140]   without the fear.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:20.620]   You were essentially going through therapy in your sleep,
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.020]   self-induced therapy.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:24.100]   It's like trauma therapy where you try and divorce
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.020]   the emotion from the experience.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.700]   And then you wake up and some people also have
[01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:31.480]   the other component of REM, which is atonia,
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.060]   which is paralysis.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:36.860]   Pot smokers experience this a lot more than non-pot smokers.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.220]   There's an invasion of paralysis into the waking state.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.620]   I'm not a pot smoker, but I have experienced this.
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:44.960]   And when you wake up and you're paralyzed for a second,
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:48.780]   it's terrifying, but then you jolt yourself alert.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:53.780]   So the REM sleep is important for kind of the self-induced
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.820]   therapy and forgetting the bad stuff.
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.180]   It's good for uncoupling the emotions from bad experiences.
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.180]   And just there are two therapies,
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:04.540]   eye movement desensitization reprocessing,
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.100]   which is a eye movement thing that shuts down the amygdala
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.860]   during therapy, not during sleep.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:13.140]   And ketamine, which is a dissociative analgesic.
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.300]   It's actually very similar to PCP.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.560]   And ketamine is now being used as a trauma therapy
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.320]   when someone comes into the ER, for instance,
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.780]   and they were in a terrible car accident.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.180]   I mean, these are horrible things to describe,
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.820]   but you know, they saw a relative impaled on the driving,
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.060]   steering column or something,
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.480]   and they will give this drug to try and shut off
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.240]   the emotion system so that,
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.660]   because they're not going to forget, let's be honest.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.200]   You don't forget the bad stuff,
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.640]   but it is possible to uncouple the bad events
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.540]   from the emotional system.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.520]   And there's all sorts of ethical issues about whether or not
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.580]   that's good or bad to do,
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.120]   but PTSD is a failure to uncouple the emotion
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.180]   from these intense experiences.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.440]   - So the goal of this kind of therapy
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.860]   is in the uncoupling for that to be permanent,
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.580]   to separate.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.260]   - So they can recount the event,
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.460]   and they can describe it without it triggering
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:05.180]   the same somatic experience of terror and dread,
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:08.460]   because those feelings can be debilitating, obviously.
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.860]   - And you're saying physiologically in REM sleep,
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.180]   a similar process is happening.
[01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.020]   - That's right.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.340]   That thematically, REM sleep is about experiencing
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:21.020]   or replaying intense emotions without experience,
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:23.580]   the somatic, the physical component of the emotion,
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.220]   either the acting out or the accelerated heart rate
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:28.180]   and agitation.
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.620]   Likewise, with things like ketamine therapies,
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.340]   that's the idea is you're uncoupling the physical sensation
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.060]   from the mental events.
[01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:39.340]   - What is REM sleep and why is it so special?
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.620]   Maybe we can comment on that.
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.260]   Rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.880]   - Yeah, discovered in the '50s at the University of Chicago,
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.980]   it's intense brain activity,
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.060]   high levels of metabolic activity,
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:52.100]   dreams in which people report a lot of the theory of mind.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.860]   We were talking about Simon Baron Cohen.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.500]   Theory of mind was actually something that he developed
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.920]   for the diagnosis of autism.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:03.300]   If you take kids, most kids of age five, six, seven,
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.580]   put them in front of a TV screen in a laboratory,
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.580]   and you have them watch a video
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.900]   where a kid is playing with a ball or a doll,
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.860]   and then the kid puts it into a drawer,
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.160]   shuts the drawer and walks away,
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.260]   and another kid comes in,
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.700]   and you ask the child who's observing this little movie,
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.500]   you say, "What does this second child think?"
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:22.420]   And a typical kid would say, "They want to play,
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.060]   and they don't know where the ball or doll is,"
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.840]   or "They're upset," or "They're sad, they want the doll."
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.580]   Autistic children tend to say, "The doll's in the drawer.
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.060]   The toy's in the drawer."
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:35.580]   They tend to fixate.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.320]   They can't get in on the event.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.100]   They can't get into the mind of the,
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.900]   they don't have a theory of mind.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:44.100]   Dreams in REM have a heavy theory of mind component.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.180]   People are after me trying to get me.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.420]   You can assign motive to other people.
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.580]   I'm afraid, but it's because there's an expectation.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:55.180]   That doesn't tend to happen in slow-wave sleep dreams.
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:57.100]   Now, all this, of course, is by waking people up
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.620]   and asking them what they were dreaming about,
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:02.700]   which from a standpoint of a AI guy or a machine learning guy
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.640]   or a neuroscientist, kind of like, eh,
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.340]   but it's the best we've got.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.980]   But brain imaging in waking states
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:11.540]   while people view a movie and then brain imaging
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.060]   while people are sleeping supports the idea
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.380]   that that's basically what's going on.
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.260]   So REM sleep is amazing,
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.600]   and you're not gonna get much of it
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.940]   during your bout with Goggins, but you will afterward.
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:26.560]   - Why, so to comment, why won't I,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.540]   so is it not possible to get into it real quick?
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.900]   - Only if you're very, very sleep-deprived,
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.060]   but because you're going to be at high muscular output,
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:36.980]   that's going to bias you
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.740]   towards more slow-wave sleep overall.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.460]   And your body and brain are smart.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.900]   They, it will know, they will know
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.300]   that your main goal is to recover so you can keep going,
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.580]   so you can keep firing neuromuscular contractions
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.820]   and you can keep running so that you can,
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:57.660]   I mean, it's amazing to think, like, why do we ever stop?
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:58.940]   Like, unlike weight training
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.140]   where I can't do a 500-pound deadlift, I just can't.
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:03.980]   I could train for it,
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.540]   but I certainly can't do a 600-pound deadlift.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:06.820]   I can't do that.
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:10.860]   What causes us to stop an endurance event
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.820]   is usually not a physical barrier.
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:15.600]   It's almost always a purely mental barrier.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.780]   And that's a very interesting problem.
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.340]   I mean, neuroscientists don't tend to think
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.740]   about those sorts of problems
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.900]   'cause it sounds so non-neuroscientific,
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.200]   but that's fundamentally related to the question of,
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.100]   you know, what is pursuit?
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:33.220]   What is the desire to push and to carry on?
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:34.860]   - Is there a neuroscientific answer
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.060]   for that question, you think?
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.380]   - I think the closest thing is this paper
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:42.420]   from Genelia Farms, the Howard Hughes campus,
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.440]   showing that if you put animals
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.740]   into a simulated environment
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.060]   where you can measure their effort,
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:51.660]   the forces while they're running,
[01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.940]   and you can control the visual environment,
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.060]   and you can create a scenario
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:58.100]   where the animal thinks that its output is futile.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.020]   It thinks, it knows it's running and it's actually running,
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.740]   but you change the frequency of the stripes going by
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:04.980]   in their visual world,
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:07.220]   such that they think they're not getting anywhere,
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:09.220]   and eventually they quit.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.500]   And the thing that determines whether or not they quit
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:14.460]   is a threshold level of epinephrine in the brainstem.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:16.060]   If you drop that level back down
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.320]   or you give the animals dopamine, essentially,
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.420]   they keep going.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.500]   If you take dopamine down,
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.660]   they're like, "This isn't worth it.
[01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:25.980]   "It's helpless.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:27.660]   "This isn't worth my time and energy."
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:28.820]   - But this is where the difference
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:32.780]   between humans and non-human animals is interesting
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:34.140]   'cause it does feel like humans
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:38.120]   have an extra level of cognitive ability
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.580]   that might be relevant here.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.800]   - Well, you can pull from different time references.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.600]   So if you're in that moment,
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.460]   you're gonna need a kit of things to pull from.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:52.680]   So you can think this is in honor of someone else
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.960]   that passed away,
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.220]   and you will find a gas reserve that's amazing.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.040]   Now, whether or not mice are like,
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.240]   "I remember my brother back in the other cage
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.980]   "when I was a little mouse."
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.040]   We don't know,
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:08.460]   but it's very likely that they don't do that,
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.620]   that they're so present,
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.500]   they're in the experience of there and then and now,
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:15.960]   that they aren't able to extract from the past,
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.340]   and they're not able to project into the future,
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.720]   like how great it's gonna feel
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.540]   when I get to the end of this really lame VR corridor.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.060]   I don't think they think about that.
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:28.660]   - And think about like, if I quit now,
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.660]   how will that have,
[01:30:29.660 --> 01:30:31.700]   what kind of effect will it have on the rest of my life
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.540]   in the future difficult times?
[01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.120]   Like if you allow yourself to quit
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.220]   in this particular moment,
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.180]   you'll become a quitter more and more in life,
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:41.440]   and then you're going to not get the other nice,
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:45.020]   the opposite sex mammals.
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.140]   - That's pretty severe.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:49.540]   You went there, you took it the whole way to evolution
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.380]   and back again.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:51.680]   I mean, but that's really it.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.260]   I mean, our ability to time reference
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:56.100]   in the past, present, or future.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:59.340]   I do believe that we can be in the present and the past,
[01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:00.660]   or the present and the future,
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.420]   or only in the present,
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.540]   or only in the future,
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.380]   or only in the past.
[01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.780]   But I don't think that we can really think
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:08.220]   about past, present, and future all at once.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:10.900]   And this has a similarity to covert attention.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:13.760]   Like we can split our visual attention into two things.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.560]   We really can do a task,
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.860]   even though we can't multitask.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:18.620]   Or we can bring those two spotlights of attention
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.100]   to the same location.
[01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.060]   But it's very hard to split our attention
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.420]   in really well into three domains,
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:26.580]   excuse me, into three domains.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.260]   I think that that's very, very challenging.
[01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:33.060]   And our time referencing scheme tends to be
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.960]   just one or two time references.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.420]   - So Lisa Feldman Barrett,
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:40.740]   I'm not sure if you've done work together,
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.660]   but at least you're--
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.780]   - I found out about her because of you
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:45.020]   and your podcast with her.
[01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.260]   And I brought her onto Instagram,
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.340]   did an Instagram Live about emotion.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.500]   And it was fascinating.
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.540]   And she's a very spirited and very, very smart woman.
[01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.380]   - Fearless and brilliant.
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.900]   So I love her, she's amazing.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.900]   She's not a scholar of hallucinogens or dreams,
[01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:07.540]   but she had this intuition that there may be a connection
[01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.860]   between the kind of dissociation that happens in dreaming
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.200]   and that happens in like psychedelics.
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.420]   Because of my previous conversation with you
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:26.380]   on this podcast, Matthew Johnson from Johns Hopkins
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.060]   reached out and he said,
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:31.260]   but he commented, I think,
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.820]   on something that we commented on,
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.300]   I don't even remember exactly what,
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.580]   but that there's not many studies,
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:39.140]   it's not being psychedelics
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.980]   and not being rigorously studied in an academic setting,
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.660]   like with a full rigor of science.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:46.620]   And he said, "Well, actually,
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:47.960]   "that's exactly what we're doing
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.180]   "and they're extremely well-funded now."
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:53.000]   And it's been a long battle to get it accepted
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.780]   as a serious scientific pursuit.
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   So, but, and I'd like to ask you a little bit about that.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.180]   Do you have a sense about connection
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.940]   between dreams and psychedelics
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:09.460]   or these different explorations of mind states
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.100]   that are outside of the standard normal one,
[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.460]   that's the wake mindset?
[01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.580]   - Yeah, I loved your discussion with Matthew.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:19.340]   I knew of the Hopkins group and the stuff they were doing,
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:21.800]   but I didn't know much about it at all.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.480]   And I learned a ton from that podcast.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.620]   I reached out to him just to say,
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.380]   "Love what you're doing, I think it's incredible."
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.260]   So yeah, your podcast has been a great source
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:34.260]   of serious academic and intellectual conversation for me.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.580]   I think what they're doing at Hopkins is amazing.
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.220]   He has a collaborator there,
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.980]   actually, they had a very popular paper
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:43.540]   I just throw out there for fun,
[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:46.340]   who was a postdoc at Stanford.
[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:47.820]   Her name is Gule.
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:50.140]   She's Turkish, I believe.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:54.520]   And I apologize, her last name escapes me at the moment,
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.200]   but that's just a function of my brain.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.640]   She had a paper showing that she put octopi on MDMA,
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.280]   on ecstasy and found out,
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.040]   this was published in Current Biology,
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.200]   it was a great journal,
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.980]   showing that the octopi then wanted to spend more time
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:12.560]   with other octopi, and they started cuddling.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.800]   So they're colleagues out there.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:19.080]   But the Hopkins project is super interesting
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.180]   because I think they were initially supported
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.120]   mainly through private philanthropy.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.460]   And now you're starting to see some more interest
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:28.940]   at the level of NIH about psychedelics.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:32.260]   It's a complicated space because the psychedelics
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:36.260]   are always looked at through the lens of the '60s
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.780]   and people losing their mind.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:42.580]   I always say, you don't want a Ken Kesey out of the game.
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:43.820]   Ken Kesey was amazing, right?
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:45.300]   Part of the whole beat generation thing.
[01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:48.180]   And he was actually at the VA near Stanford.
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:49.540]   That's where he eventually, in Menlo Park,
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.220]   he wrote "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.340]   or maybe that was about him.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.160]   Anyway, the comments will tell me how wrong I am,
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.060]   but I think I'm tossing these words
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.640]   in the right general direction.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   But Huxley, Kesey, they did a lot of LSD
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.320]   and they all lost their jobs, right?
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.040]   They lost their jobs at big institutions
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.620]   like Harvard and Stanford and elsewhere,
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:16.620]   or they left because they made themselves the experiments.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:21.180]   Hopkins, as far as I know, is one of the first places,
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:24.180]   if not the first place, where whatever Matt may
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.580]   or may not be doing in his own life, I don't know,
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:28.540]   it's really about the patients and whether or not
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.620]   the patients in these institutional review board
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:34.180]   approved studies, whether or not they're getting better
[01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.820]   in situations like depression.
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:40.220]   I think it's clear that there's a very close relationship
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:43.940]   between hallucinogenic states and dreaming of the sort
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.700]   that would describe for REM dreaming.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.420]   And there's a terrific set of books
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.900]   and body of scientific literature
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.700]   from a guy named Alan Hobson, who is an MD,
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:56.340]   is at Harvard Med, and he wrote books like "Dream Drugstore."
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.020]   One of the first neuroscience books I ever read
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.780]   was about hallucinations and how psychedelics
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.300]   and dreaming are very similar.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:03.500]   That was way back when I was in high school,
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.820]   I was just curious.
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:08.100]   And he really understood the relationship between LSD
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.960]   and REM dreams and how similar they are.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.540]   I think psychedelics, and Matt knows way more about this
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.380]   than I do, of course, but psychedelics
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.660]   have some very interesting properties.
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.640]   They are certainly not for everybody, right?
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.940]   And kids, it's a problem.
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.620]   I think the major issues right now
[01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:29.220]   around the psychedelic conversation is that it's clear
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:33.020]   that they can unveil certain elements of neuroplasticity.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.520]   They make the brain amenable to change,
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.380]   changing up space-time relationships,
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:39.780]   changing up the emotional load of an event
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.460]   and being able to reframe that.
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.240]   It's clear that happens.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:45.180]   But there's two major issues.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.940]   One is that people talk about plasticity
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.180]   as if plasticity is the goal,
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:51.660]   but plasticity is a state
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:53.620]   within which you can direct neurology.
[01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:56.820]   And the question is, what changes are you trying to get to?
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.760]   So people are just taking psychedelics to unveil plasticity
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.020]   without thinking about what circuits
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:04.580]   they want to modify and how.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.380]   I think that's a problem.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.440]   I think there's great potential, however,
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:12.220]   for people opening up these states of plasticity
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.520]   with psychedelics or otherwise
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:16.180]   and directing the plastic changes
[01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:17.480]   toward a particular endpoint.
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:22.060]   And there's an absolutely spectacular paper at a UC Davis,
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.820]   published as a full article in Nature
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.380]   just a couple of months ago,
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:28.380]   showing that there are psychedelics
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.100]   that are now can be modified.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.860]   So chemists have gotten into the game now
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.460]   and modifying to take away the hallucinogenic component
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.740]   where you still get the neuroplasticity components.
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:40.460]   And for a lot of people, it'd be like, oh, that's no fun.
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.140]   That's not giving you the wild experience.
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.140]   But I do think that that holds great potential
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.340]   for people that wouldn't otherwise
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.740]   orient towards some of these drugs.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.380]   So I think it's really marvelous what's happening
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.740]   and what's about to happen.
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:57.500]   And I think there is one drug in that kit of drugs
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:00.860]   that's very unusual, like psilocybin, LSD,
[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:04.180]   those promote heavy, heavy serotonin release
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:06.940]   and lateralized connections ramp up, et cetera.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.340]   Matt talked about all that.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:13.300]   But MDMA, ecstasy, is a very unusual situation
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.140]   where dopamine is very, very high
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.860]   because of the way the drug is designed.
[01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.100]   Dopamine release, it goes through the roof.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:23.860]   So people feel great and they want to move
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:25.300]   and they have a lot of energy.
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:27.640]   But serotonin levels are also high.
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.420]   And that's a very unnatural state.
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:35.040]   And why MDMA may, and I want to highlight may,
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:39.480]   have particularly high potential for the treatment
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.160]   of certain forms of depression is an interesting question
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.640]   because never before, as far as we know in human history,
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   has there been a possibility of opening up
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:53.080]   dopaminergic and serotonergic states at the same time,
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:55.180]   dopamine being the molecule pursuit and reward
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.640]   and more and more, and serotonin being one of bliss
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.100]   and being content right where you're at.
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.280]   So it's almost like those two things
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.520]   wrap back on themselves and create this very unusual state.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.360]   And I think the bigger conversation
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.280]   is what to do with a state like that.
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.240]   Like, do you, is it about self-love?
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.480]   Is it about developing love for another person?
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.280]   Is it about forgetting hate?
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.240]   Like, these are powerful molecules.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.240]   And I think if the academic community
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:20.880]   and the clinical community is going to move forward
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.600]   with them in any serious way,
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.400]   I think there needs to be a conversation
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.360]   about what they're being used for.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.480]   - Right, and coupled with that,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.840]   I think similar to what you're saying,
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.820]   like Matt has talked about, as others have talked about,
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.980]   some of the biggest benefits of progress,
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:42.840]   whether it's quitting smoking and all this kind of stuff,
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.600]   is in the days after, it's the integration of the experience.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.680]   So maybe you open up the brain to the neuroplasticity,
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.320]   but then there's work to be done.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.120]   It's not, you're like, you shake up something
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.000]   in the biology of the brain,
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.100]   but you have to do then its work.
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.120]   - Absolutely.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.440]   Now, a friend of mine who's a physician,
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.600]   he says, who's quite open to this idea
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.400]   that psychedelics could play a real role in real medicine,
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:12.200]   says, "Better living through chemistry
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.440]   "still requires better living."
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.560]   And I think it's a beautiful statement.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.920]   I wish I had said it, but he gets the credit.
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.560]   But the plasticity window opens, and then as you said,
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.320]   what are you going to do in the two weeks, three weeks,
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:26.400]   four weeks afterward?
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.280]   Because that's the real opportunity.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.800]   But those psychedelic experiences
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.040]   are really a case of an amplified experience
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.600]   inside of an amplified experience,
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.840]   so much so that everything seems relevant.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.800]   And it's fascinating.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.960]   I mean, my hope is that the AI and machine learning
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.640]   and the brain machine interface and all that
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:49.620]   will eventually be merged with the psychedelic treatments
[01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.320]   so that an individual can go in,
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.000]   take whatever amount of whatever's safe for them,
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.600]   working with a clinician, and really direct the plasticity
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:01.960]   while maybe stimulating the medial orbital frontal cortex,
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.280]   or increasing the observer,
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:05.160]   or decreasing the observer in the brain,
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.480]   or decreasing the amygdala.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.960]   I mean, it's doable.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:11.080]   It's doable with transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.720]   and it's for shutting down activity,
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.600]   and it's doable with ultrasound.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.440]   Ultrasound now allows very focal activation
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.120]   of particular brain regions
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.040]   through the skull noninvasively.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.980]   - So it's approaching the same kind of therapy
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.900]   from different angles.
[01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:26.760]   One of AI's is the computational side,
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.640]   sort of injecting the robotics,
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.640]   injecting, maybe you can even think about it
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.760]   as electricity, the electrical approach,
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.680]   versus then the chemical approach.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.780]   - Absolutely, and then the psychology is subjective, right?
[01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:45.960]   So it's gonna take some real understanding
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.540]   of what that person's lexicon is.
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.440]   Like, you know, that wasn't a pun, sorry.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.840]   (laughing)
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.240]   Sorry, terrible.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:55.120]   I'm like the worst.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.620]   That's the one thing I know from the feedback
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:57.460]   on my podcast.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:00.060]   My jokes are terrible, but I never claim to be funny.
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.200]   (laughing)
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.720]   But somebody who they really trust
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.160]   and understands when somebody says, you know,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.520]   for a very stoic person, like I'm imagining
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.760]   you interviewed the great Dan Gable, right?
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.880]   I don't know anything about Dan,
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.960]   but can you imagine, like, you asked Dan, like, you know,
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.320]   how you feel about something while on one of these drugs?
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:21.720]   And like, I mean, his languaging might,
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.280]   if he says that was troubling,
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.000]   it might mean that it was very troubling
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.360]   or not troubling at all.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.300]   So people are, language is a poor guide
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.720]   because if I say I'm upset, how upset is that?
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.360]   Well, that's very subjective.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.400]   So you need, we need, can you build a tool for that?
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.720]   Can you build an AI tool for that?
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.800]   - Yeah, deeper, yeah, well--
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.380]   - Maybe that's the eye, maybe that's our,
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:44.840]   that's what the eyes could reveal.
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:47.380]   - So language is not just words, it's everything together.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:50.460]   And that's one of the fascinating things about the eyes
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:51.520]   and the window to the soul.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.140]   I mean, they express so much, the face, the eyes, the body.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.140]   I mean, Lisa talks about that, the communication of emotions.
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.100]   It's a super complex.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:04.860]   Perhaps it's a bit of a side fun tangent,
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:09.860]   but Matt, Matthew Johnson brings up DMT.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.780]   And the experience of DMT is,
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:16.180]   from a scientific perspective,
[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.340]   just a mystery in itself over its intensity
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:21.860]   of what happens to the brain.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:25.740]   And of course, Joe Rogan and others bring it up
[01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:30.480]   as a very different, special kind of experience.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.900]   And elves seem to come up often.
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.140]   - I've never tried DMT,
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:38.740]   what allows for hallucinogenic states.
[01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:41.940]   And it, I mean, DMT is a really interesting molecule.
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:46.540]   There are a lot of people experimenting now with DMT.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.060]   And they just, the way they've described it
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:56.060]   is as a kind of a freight train through space and time.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.180]   Very different than the way people describe LSD
[01:43:58.180 --> 01:43:59.820]   type experiences or psilocybin,
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:02.140]   where time and space are very fluid,
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.340]   but it tends to be a kind of a slower role, if you will.
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:10.220]   So it's clear that DMT is tapping into a brain state
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.860]   that's distinctly different than the other psychedelics.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:17.920]   And you mentioned jujitsu and these other communities.
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:20.580]   I mean, it's, I think it's interesting
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:23.460]   because jujitsu is a nonverbal activity
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.860]   and people get together and talk about
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:27.700]   this nonverbal activity and they show great love for it.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:29.820]   In the same way that surfers, you know,
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:32.020]   I've known some surfers in my time
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:35.020]   and they will get up at the crack of dawn
[01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.140]   and drive really, really far to sit in the water
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.180]   and wait for this wave to come.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:40.860]   I have to imagine it's pretty fantastic.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.800]   I think that human beings now,
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:46.400]   some of whom are in the scientific community
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.100]   are starting to feel comfortable enough
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:51.380]   to talk about some of these other loves and other endeavors,
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:54.060]   because they do reveal a certain component
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.940]   about our underlying neurology.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.940]   I'm fascinated by the concept of wordlessness,
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:04.900]   activities in which language is just not sufficient
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:09.540]   to capture and in which feel so vital as a reset,
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.300]   as important as sleep.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.380]   You know, I think that's one of the dangers of the phone
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.500]   is not that you're gonna get into some online battle
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.680]   or that you're always staring at the phone,
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.920]   is that it's a words.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.800]   Whereas we read things, we're hearing the script in our head
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.500]   and I think getting into states
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:26.480]   where we are in a state of wordlessness
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   is very renewing and replenishing and just can feel amazing.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.080]   And I believe also can help us tap into creative states
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:38.800]   and allow our neurology to access creative states.
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.800]   And sleep is one such wordlessness period.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.860]   So one of the most interesting things to me
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:48.340]   are states that one can approach in waking,
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:51.780]   non-sleep depressed, wordlessness through,
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:54.180]   maybe it's jujitsu, maybe it's for some people surfing,
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:56.220]   maybe it's dancing, maybe it's just,
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.260]   I don't know, staring at a wall, who knows.
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:01.380]   But where the language components of the brain
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.220]   are completely shut down.
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:06.560]   And it has to be the case that drugs are no drugs,
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.620]   that the brain is entering and starting to states
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.120]   and starting to use algorithms
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.240]   that are distinctly different
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.540]   than when we're trying to compose things
[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.780]   in any kind of coherent way for someone else to understand.
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:20.200]   There's no interest in anyone else understanding
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.380]   what you're experiencing in that moment.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.540]   And that's beautiful.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.740]   And I think it's not just beautiful because it feels good,
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:29.780]   I think it's beautiful because it's important
[01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:32.740]   and it's clearly fundamental to our neurology.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:35.100]   - And your sense is there's a connection
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:37.140]   between dreams and DMT and psychedelic,
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:41.700]   like all of the, you can understand one
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:42.660]   by studying the other.
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:46.260]   So for example, dreams are also very difficult to study,
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.900]   but they're more accessible, it's safer to study.
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:51.880]   - And we're told we need to get more of it.
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:54.380]   Whereas with psychedelics, there's this big question mark,
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:56.300]   is it gonna make everyone crazy?
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.060]   Is it gonna be legal?
[01:46:58.060 --> 01:47:00.140]   I mean, it's kind of interesting how,
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:03.340]   if one looks on Instagram, one could almost think
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:04.820]   that these drugs are already legal
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:06.820]   based on the way that people commute, but they're not yet.
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.300]   There's still a lot of them are scheduled.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:10.500]   - And there's a lot of questions.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:13.560]   I mean, but nevertheless, it's like,
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:20.140]   my hope is that science opens up to these drugs
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.880]   a little bit more.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.420]   It's just, I have this intuition that,
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:27.300]   like a lot of people share that they would be able
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:32.060]   to unlock deeper understanding of our own mind.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.860]   It's any kind of, same as studying dreams.
[01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.700]   - Absolutely.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:39.360]   - So creativity is in the nonlinearities, right?
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.100]   But productivity is in the implementation of linearities.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.780]   I mean, that's what is absolutely clear.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.320]   This is why I think we were talking earlier
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.900]   about why a formal rigorous training in something
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:51.580]   where other people are looking at you and telling you,
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:54.020]   "No, not good enough, go back and do it again."
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:56.100]   There's real value to that because otherwise,
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:58.540]   it's just ideas, it's just vapors.
[01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:01.220]   - You know, one thing that Matt mentioned
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.900]   as the study that they're working on is,
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.660]   as opposed to, I think most of the psychedelic studies
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:12.020]   they've done is on how to treat different conditions.
[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:13.700]   And one of the things they're working on now
[01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:18.140]   is to try to do a study where, for creatives,
[01:48:18.140 --> 01:48:20.180]   for people that don't have a condition
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:21.020]   that they're trying to treat,
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.840]   but instead see how this,
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.980]   how psychedelics can help you create.
[01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:27.140]   So like-- - Goodness,
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:29.740]   if you take creatives and you give them more psychedelics,
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:31.660]   they're not gonna be able to get out of their room.
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:32.660]   - I don't know.
[01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:36.140]   Well, but this is the, maybe you can speak to that,
[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:38.980]   psychedelics or not, or dreams or tools in general,
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:40.620]   how to be better creatives.
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.940]   That's an interesting, I don't often see studies
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.000]   of this nature of like how to take high performance
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.820]   in the mental creative space
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.660]   and get them to perform even better.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.660]   So it's not average people,
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.860]   it's like masters of their craft, like taking,
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.460]   I mean, his examples was taking an Elon Musk,
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.220]   which is in the engineering space,
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:05.580]   and maybe musicians and all that kind of stuff,
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.660]   and studying that.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.500]   I mean, that's weird.
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:13.700]   Usually the science, the scientific exploration there
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.780]   has been done by the musicians themselves,
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:17.900]   as has been documented.
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:21.380]   - Like jazz is like all nonlinearities, right?
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:23.660]   But the people still have to know
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:25.740]   how to play their instruments, right?
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.580]   There's some early skill building that's critical.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:32.140]   I mean, when you mention someone like Elon,
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.620]   I mean, he's already a virtuoso, right?
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:36.420]   'Cause he, and in so many different domains,
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:39.220]   I've never met him, but it's clear, right?
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:42.860]   It's not just that he's ambitious and bold and brave
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.300]   and all that, it's all that.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:48.780]   And there's clearly a different way
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:50.120]   of looking at the same problems
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.580]   that everyone else is looking at.
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:53.300]   And people are probably banging their head
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:54.580]   against the refrigerator, thinking like,
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:56.820]   think differently, it doesn't work that way.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:59.820]   It involved, there's a certain anxiety in,
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.540]   for the, I'm not talking about for Elon,
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:02.800]   but I have no idea.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.780]   But I think for somebody who's very structured,
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.600]   very regimented, very linear,
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:12.060]   the anxiety comes from letting go of those linearities.
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:14.080]   And for the person that's very creative,
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.260]   the anxiety comes from trying to impose linearities, right?
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:21.020]   The really creative artists or musician,
[01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:23.740]   they seem nuts, they seem like they can't get
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.040]   their life together because they can't.
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:29.460]   And we look at people who are kind of pseudo Asperger's
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.300]   or Asperger's or some forms of autism,
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.140]   and they are so hyper-linear,
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:36.460]   but you take away those linearities and they freak out.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:39.100]   And that's kind of the essence of some of those syndromes.
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:42.380]   So I think that the ability to toggle back and forth
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:44.140]   between those states is what's remarkable.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:46.420]   I mean, because we're here and we're having this discussion,
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.180]   I mean, Steve Jobs is a good example.
[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.980]   He probably the best example,
[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:52.700]   somebody who actually talked about his own process,
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.900]   about the merging of art and science,
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:57.820]   art and engineering, humanities and science.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.580]   Very few people can do that.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:03.260]   You seem to have a capacity to do that.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:06.300]   Like you know poetry and you are AI guy,
[01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:08.660]   like there's nothing linear about poetry
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:09.780]   as far as I can tell.
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:12.660]   - I mean, I do wonder just like we've been talking about
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:15.140]   if there's any ways to push that to its limits
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.660]   to explore further.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:20.280]   I don't like leaning, this is why I'm bothered
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:21.940]   there's not more science and psychedelics
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.700]   I haven't done almost,
[01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:29.700]   so I've eaten mushrooms a few times allegedly,
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:31.740]   but that's it.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.500]   And the reason I don't do more,
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:36.380]   the reason I haven't done DMT is because it's illegal
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:39.140]   and it's like not well studied.
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:44.100]   I'm in those things, I'm not usually at the cutting edge,
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.460]   but I'm very curious and it feels like
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:51.140]   there could be tools to be discovered there,
[01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:53.620]   not for fun, not for recreation,
[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:58.620]   but for like encouraging whether you're a linear thinker
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:01.820]   to go non-linear or it's non-linear to go linear,
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.500]   like to shake things up.
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:05.060]   You mentioned Dan Gable,
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.760]   the idea of Dan Gable on psychedelics is fascinating to me
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:11.180]   because he's such a control freak.
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:13.660]   I mean, he lets control-- - That I would show up for.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.220]   That I would show up for.
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:17.620]   - But like so much of these psychedelic experiences
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:19.860]   it feels like is for letting go.
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:20.680]   - That's right.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.520]   - To resist.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.900]   - But that's supposedly where the growth is
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:27.500]   in giving oneself over to the process.
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.340]   - And that's for people who are like master controllers,
[01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:33.140]   he's one of the greatest coaches of all time,
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.740]   it's fascinating to see what that battle looks like
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.660]   of resistance and then of letting go.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:42.540]   Yeah, I mean, I can't wait to see
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.020]   where these studies take us.
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:45.580]   - Well, it's clearly happening.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:46.420]   You know, I've asked,
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.700]   I have a couple of colleagues at Stanford
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:49.380]   who are doing animal studies.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:51.460]   I've asked around, you know,
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:54.240]   there's a lot of discussion in the neuroscience community
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.840]   about what the perception of a laboratory is
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.480]   if they work on psychedelics.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:02.840]   I mean, I have to tip my hat to the folks at Hopkins,
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.080]   they are pioneers.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:06.000]   And as Terry Signowski,
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.600]   he's a computational neuroscientist down at Salk says,
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.960]   I don't think he was the first person to say this,
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:12.600]   he says, you know how to spot the pioneers?
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.520]   They're the ones with the arrows in their backs.
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:15.360]   - Yeah.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:19.920]   - And you know, it's an unkind world to a scientist
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.020]   that's trying to do really cutting edge stuff.
[01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:25.140]   My colleague, David Spiegel, who studies medical hypnosis,
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:28.740]   he's got dozens of studies now showing that hypnosis
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:30.420]   can be beneficial for pain management,
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:32.460]   anxiety management, cancer outcomes.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:34.260]   And it's finally, you know,
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.900]   at the point where there's so much data,
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:39.380]   but people hear hypnosis and they think of stage hypnosis,
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.020]   which is like the furthest thing from what he's doing.
[01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:47.020]   And I think mind body type stuff, hypnosis,
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.440]   respiration and breathing,
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:52.560]   I think the hard science walk into the problem
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.920]   is always going to be best to get the community on board.
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:58.120]   And then it's up to people like Matt
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:01.720]   and to really, you know, take it to the next level.
[01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:03.800]   And as I say, not Kesey out of the game,
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:07.300]   because Kesey basically was taken too much of his own stuff
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.400]   and he started dressing crazy, a banana hats.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.720]   And like you see him, he had the magic bus.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:14.340]   So, you know, the day I start driving to work
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:17.680]   in the magic bus, that's the day I lose my job.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:21.000]   I'm not into buses or wearing fruit, but-
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.340]   - You're going to get a phone call from me
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:23.600]   and I hope you do the same for me.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.660]   It's like, dude, what are you doing?
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:28.040]   - Well, what's interesting earlier,
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:29.520]   we're talking about the challenge with David
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.560]   that you're about to do.
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.600]   I mean, that is a psychedelic experience of sorts
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.240]   because you're biasing your mind
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.720]   towards a pretty extreme neurochemical state
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:40.760]   and you don't know what you're going to find there.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.160]   And that's kind of the excitement,
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:43.640]   at least for me as an observer.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.360]   It's like, I want to know
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:49.520]   what the experience is like afterward.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.120]   I want to know, like, how was it?
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.720]   I mean, I'm sure you're going to get something.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.920]   Like you said, you're going to grow.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:54.860]   The question is how.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.820]   - And not resisting.
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:57.840]   I mean, it's the same as with a psychedelic experience.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:01.440]   It's like not, like giving yourself over completely
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.360]   to the experience and not resisting
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.020]   and going through the whole mental journey
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:08.720]   of whether it's anger or excitement or exhaustion,
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:09.560]   the whole thing.
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.560]   It's, I mean, that's the entirety of the process
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.920]   that David goes through
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.500]   when he does his own challenges and so on,
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:21.480]   is that whole journey.
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.120]   He finds purposely, like,
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:27.320]   missile seeks the limits of the mind
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.640]   that whenever the resistance is felt,
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.920]   runs up against it,
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.560]   and then goes through the full journey of going beyond it
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.640]   and seeing what's there on the other side.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:38.120]   - Well, stress has these two sides,
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:40.140]   the limbic friction of being tired
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:41.720]   and needing to get more energized.
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:43.520]   That's one form of stress.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.640]   And then there's the feeling too amped up
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.920]   and needing to calm down.
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.160]   The typical discussion around stress is one thing,
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.720]   but it's all limbic friction.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.600]   It's just that when I say limbic friction,
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.900]   that's not a real scientific term.
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.960]   I just mean the limbic system
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.640]   wanting to pull you down into sleep
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.200]   or wanting to put you into panic.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.720]   And you using top-down processing,
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:04.880]   using that evolved forebrain to say,
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.880]   "Mm-mm, I'm not going to go to sleep."
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:09.120]   And, "Mm-mm, I'm not going to freak out."
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.840]   And those top-down control mechanisms are,
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:15.160]   I mean, when those get honed, that's beautiful
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.660]   because then you're increasing capacity for everything.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.360]   - This month on the podcast,
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.720]   you're talking about neuroplasticity.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.260]   You mentioned it a bunch already.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:29.040]   Is there something you're looking forward to specifically,
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.920]   like something maybe you're fascinated by
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.720]   that jumps to mind about neuroplasticity,
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.620]   this fascinating property of the brain?
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:39.560]   - Yeah, I think that it's clear
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.800]   there's one facet of neuroplasticity
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.340]   that is very well supported by the research data
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.840]   that hardly anyone has implemented in the real world.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.600]   And that's the release of acetylcholine from these neurons
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.720]   in the forebrain called nucleus basalis.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:56.000]   This is mainly the work of Mike Merzenich,
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.360]   who used to be at UCSF,
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:00.000]   and some of his scientific offspring, Greg Reckin's own,
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.480]   and Michael Kilgaard and others.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:04.840]   What they showed was increases in acetylcholine,
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:09.080]   this molecule associated with focus, in concert,
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:11.920]   meaning at the same time as some event,
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.920]   motor event or music event or any kind of sensory event,
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.540]   immediately reorganizes the neocortex
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.980]   so that there's a permanent map representation of that event.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:27.440]   And I absolutely believe that this can be channeled
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.980]   toward accelerated skill learning.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:31.480]   And my friend and colleague, Eddie Chang,
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.760]   who's now the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF,
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.720]   but also a fine scientist in his own right,
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.760]   not just a clinician,
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:42.560]   he's doing studies looking at rapid acquisition of language
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:43.680]   using these principles.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.760]   He trained with Merzenich.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:48.120]   It's clear we have these gates on plasticity
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:48.960]   in the forebrain,
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:53.720]   and they are gated by nicotinic acetylcholine transmission.
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:56.880]   And why that hasn't made it into protocols
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:58.880]   for motor learning, sport learning,
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.640]   language learning, music learning, emotional learning,
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:02.480]   I don't know.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:05.520]   I think part of the reason has been kind of cultural
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:07.840]   is that scientists publish their paper and they move on.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.000]   Merzenich talked a lot and still can be found
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.120]   from time to time talking about
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:16.560]   how these plasticity mechanisms can be leveraged.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.880]   But he had a commercial company,
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.260]   and so then people kind of backed away from him a little bit.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.720]   I think he was, to be honest,
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:25.240]   I think Merzenich was ahead of his time.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:27.340]   And I think the timing is right now
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.360]   for people to understand these mechanisms of plasticity
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.600]   and start to implement them.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.180]   Also, it all sounds like becoming superhuman
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:37.080]   or optimizing or whatever, all that, yes.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:39.760]   But also what about kids with language learning deficits
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.760]   or with dyslexia or just performance in school in general?
[01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.200]   I mean, I have a deep interest and concern
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:48.500]   for the future of science and mathematics
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.640]   and not just in this country, but all over the world.
[01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:56.200]   And more plasticity equals faster, better, deeper learning.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.060]   And if we don't do this,
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.500]   I don't think we're going to get the full reach
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:03.140]   out of all the machine learning tools either,
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:06.020]   because everyone talks about these huge data sets,
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:09.480]   but those huge data sets funnel into human interpretation.
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:12.380]   I mean, we don't just like stare at the numbers and bask.
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:14.660]   So the human brain, I think,
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:17.620]   needs to leverage these plasticity mechanisms
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:20.260]   to keep up with the thing that's happening very, very fast,
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.820]   which is technology development.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:24.100]   So that's a long-winded way of saying
[01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.980]   basal forebrain cholinergic transmission and plasticity,
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:29.080]   it allows for plasticity in adulthood
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:31.580]   and it allows for it in single trial learning,
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.340]   which is incredible.
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.940]   - But how do we leverage that?
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:38.160]   Like in the physical space taking actions,
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.880]   or is there some chemicals that can stimulate,
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.460]   stimulate neuroplasticity?
[01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:45.300]   Like what- - I think it's
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.740]   the intersection of the two.
[01:59:46.740 --> 01:59:48.880]   I think it's being engaged in a physical practice
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:50.980]   while enhancing pharmacology.
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:52.260]   And it has to be done safely.
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:54.140]   - And this is full of open questions.
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:56.620]   This is the very beginnings of it, like you're saying.
[01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:58.980]   - Yeah, a pill that's safe
[01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:00.720]   that increases nicotinic transmission.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:03.020]   I mean, I know a number of people that chew Nicorette.
[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:05.540]   Actually, I have a Nobel Prize winning colleague
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:08.360]   at Columbia, not to be named,
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.980]   who chews like six pieces of Nicorette
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:11.900]   in a half hour conversation with him.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:14.960]   And he started doing that as a replacement for smoking,
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:17.060]   because smoking is nicotine,
[02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:19.880]   nicotinic stimulation of the cholinergic system.
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.800]   So smokers have long known that increases focus
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.120]   and attention and learning.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.120]   It's just that the lung cancer thing is a barrier.
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:29.040]   Now I'm not suggesting people take Nicorette,
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:32.760]   but it's clear that we need better directed pharmacology.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.620]   But you can imagine next time you go in for a learning bout,
[02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:37.420]   if it's really essential,
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.780]   you might want to stimulate the nicotinic system
[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:41.520]   if that's safe for you.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.520]   Again, I'm a doctor.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.160]   So again, I'm not telling people to do this,
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:45.800]   but that's where it's going.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.480]   Until we start merging machines
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.320]   with pharmacology and behavior,
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.640]   we're just kind of walking around
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.440]   in a circle over and over again.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.320]   And it's gonna happen.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:01.320]   - Do you find computer vision, machine learning,
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.640]   from the perspective of tooling,
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.240]   as an interesting tool for analyzing,
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.280]   for processing all the data from the neuroscience world,
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:13.080]   from the neurobiology, biology,
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.120]   the chemical, all the different data sets
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.640]   that you could have about the mind,
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.040]   the eye, everything that's neck and above,
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.480]   and also the central nervous system and all?
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.720]   - Absolutely.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.640]   I think that computer science and engineering
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:29.560]   and chemistry, bioengineering,
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.400]   that's what's creating the acceleration
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.640]   and progress in neuroscience right now.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:38.680]   I think it's actually one place where science,
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.760]   I'm very reassured,
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.260]   science has invited in psychologists,
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.400]   computational biologists,
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:45.760]   at least at Stanford, MIT,
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.160]   and other places too, of course,
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:51.040]   it's clear that it's a everyone's invited
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.120]   kind of party right now.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.880]   That the major issue in the field of neuroscience,
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:57.160]   at least through my view,
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:59.200]   is that there's no conceptual leadership.
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:00.700]   No one is saying we need to work on
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:02.760]   and solve this problem or that problem.
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:05.740]   It's very fragmented right now.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:07.840]   Now, the good news is people are communicating.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.400]   So computer scientists and people who work on AI,
[02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:13.640]   machine vision, are talking to biologists and vice versa.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.640]   But it's very dispersed.
[02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:17.360]   - Is there a lot of different data sets?
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.120]   Like in your work that you've just come across,
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:23.720]   is there a huge number of disparate data sets
[02:02:23.720 --> 02:02:26.320]   around neuroscience and so on?
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.120]   - Well, there's a lot of cell sequencing stuff.
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:31.160]   So the Broad over in Boston,
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:32.520]   and then on this coast,
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.000]   the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000]   what they did, $3 billion to sequence every cell type
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.360]   in humans and in animals.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.800]   And I think their goal is to cure every disease
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.780]   by some date, I don't know, in the future.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:54.560]   Huge data sets of gene expression and protein expression.
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:55.760]   That's valuable.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:58.280]   I think no one really knows how to think
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:02.920]   about neural circuits and what is a neural circuit.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:04.560]   Is it one structure?
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.580]   Is it two structures communicating?
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.840]   I think this is where I actually think
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:13.680]   that the robotics is going to tell us how the brain works.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:15.400]   Because it's tempting to think
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:18.040]   that the brain has all these cell types
[02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:20.800]   and circuits in order to solve specific problems.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.120]   But it might be that the fundamental algorithm
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:24.960]   is to create cells and circuits
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.080]   that can solve variable problems.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.320]   We know in the retina,
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.880]   just a very simple example is that we've always heard
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:33.360]   about like cones are for color vision and high acuity,
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.520]   and rods are for night vision and non-color vision.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.840]   But at the dusk, dawn transition,
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:43.160]   certain cell types switch to do completely different,
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:44.440]   have a completely different function
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.520]   for viewing starry night
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.960]   versus what they do during the daytime.
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.120]   So neurons multiplex.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:53.840]   And I think building machines that can multiplex
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.040]   and can evolve themselves is going to help us
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.600]   really understand what the brain is doing.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.520]   We need to tease out the fundamental algorithms.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:03.280]   We know they're like motion detection
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.160]   and spatial vision and things like that.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:07.420]   I think machines are going to be much faster at that
[02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:11.040]   than our understanding of biology
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.440]   and how the brain does that.
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:15.120]   Basically, I'll be out of a job
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.560]   and people like you will have a job.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:19.640]   - Well, no, I think the main idea is that
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.120]   there won't be a job that's machine learning
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.000]   or computer vision.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.440]   It's just, it's a tool that neuroscientists
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.400]   will use more and more and more.
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:31.920]   And biologists would use.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.320]   I mean, this whole idea that it will just be a tool
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:39.220]   that allows you to start expanding
[02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:41.820]   the kind of things you can study.
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.500]   - Well, the next generation coming up,
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.140]   I can say this 'cause I now I'm blessed
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.860]   to have a bioengineering student.
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:50.900]   They think about problems so differently than biologists do.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:51.760]   We realized the other day,
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:54.380]   we both came up with a set of ideas around a certain project
[02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:56.340]   and we realized that her version of it
[02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.380]   was the exact opposite of mine,
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.260]   and hers was far more rational.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:01.620]   It's just an engineering perspective.
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:03.560]   It's like, why would we do that last?
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:04.880]   We should do that first.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:08.060]   I think that the next generation is really interested
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:09.820]   in solving practical problems.
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:12.100]   So a lot like computer science and engineering was
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:13.820]   in the late nineties, it was like,
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:16.300]   you can go do a PhD in computer science and engineering,
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.260]   maybe, or you go work for a company
[02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:20.180]   and actually build stuff that's useful.
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:21.900]   I think neuroscientists and people interested
[02:05:21.900 --> 02:05:23.780]   in neuroscience are starting to think,
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:25.580]   how can I build stuff that's useful?
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:27.880]   And this is statement is supported by the fact
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:32.100]   that many people in my business leave their academic labs.
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:33.380]   Fortunately, not all of them,
[02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:34.540]   but they leave their academic labs
[02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:37.500]   and they go work for companies, like Neuralink.
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.580]   - Like Neuralink.
[02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:42.660]   This is something I think we've spoken a few times offline
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:47.300]   about, as in speaking of computer vision,
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.820]   I'm fascinated by the eye.
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:50.820]   I did a bunch of work on the eye.
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.940]   So from, there's the neuroscientist,
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:55.060]   there's a neurobiology way of studying the eye,
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:57.980]   and there's the computer vision way of studying the eye.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:59.940]   And the computer vision way of studying the eye,
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:03.080]   of just like observing, non-contact sensing of humans,
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:04.380]   is really fascinating to me.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.780]   And studying human behavior in different contexts,
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:09.660]   like in semi-autonomous vehicles,
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.780]   it seemed like there's a lot of signal
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:14.280]   that comes from the eye, that comes from blinking,
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:16.980]   that's not fully understood yet.
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:20.180]   It's been in the lab, it's been used quite a bit
[02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:22.660]   to study like the dilation of the pupil,
[02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:26.540]   all those kinds of things we're used to infer,
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:29.820]   workload, cognitive load, all those kinds of things.
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:32.620]   But the picture is murky.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:34.380]   It's not completely well understood,
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:36.860]   especially in the wild, how much signal you can get
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.640]   from the eye, from the human face.
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:43.960]   I've downloaded Joe Rogan's,
[02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.160]   all of the podcasts he's ever done, video.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:49.000]   - You have the YouTube bank?
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.500]   - I have the YouTube bank.
[02:06:50.500 --> 02:06:55.500]   For a reason that, this was before he went with Spotify.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.180]   - You own the archive.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:01.100]   There's PubMed, and then there's the Joe Rogan experience
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.900]   owned by, or maintained by Lex.
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.740]   - Yeah, privately, for my private collection.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:10.340]   No, the reason I did it, and I did the really rigorous
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:12.200]   processing of it, which is like,
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:15.780]   I extracted all of the faces,
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:17.860]   I did the really good blink track,
[02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:21.100]   the pupil tracking and the blink detection
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.340]   for the entirety of the, oh, I should say
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:26.860]   it's from episode, I forget what it is,
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.260]   but it's like episode 900 when they switched
[02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:31.380]   to 1080p video.
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:33.500]   It was like much crappier video.
[02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:34.340]   It's still kind of--
[02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.620]   - Did you log when there was marijuana consumption
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:38.260]   or when they were drinking?
[02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.820]   - When there's smoke, I mean, there's so many--
[02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:43.060]   - 'Cause that's gonna, like, it won't throw off the data,
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:44.580]   but it's relevant to the--
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:45.420]   - It's relevant to the context.
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:46.240]   - The pupil data.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:50.180]   - So let's just put it this way.
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:51.540]   There's a lot of fascinating
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.180]   computer vision problems involved,
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:57.140]   but I only kept long sequences of data
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:00.380]   where the eyes detected exceptionally well,
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:04.140]   and I also removed people that were wearing glasses.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:08.700]   I removed, there's certain people that have a way
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:13.700]   of moving their eyes and squinting
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:19.060]   where it's harder to infer, like, concrete blinks.
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:24.940]   You know, they'll kind of have a squint the whole time,
[02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.580]   and their blink is very light.
[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:32.580]   It's very tough to know what's an actual blink.
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:35.540]   - And you got those baseball cap wearing guys.
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:37.060]   There are certain people that go on podcasts
[02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:39.860]   and wear baseball caps and don't reveal their,
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:42.380]   I don't know if they realize it or not until it comes out,
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:45.700]   but their face is completely obscured from vision.
[02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.860]   - And from a computer vision perspective,
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:49.220]   people that wear makeup,
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:52.700]   and usually women and their eyes, it complicates things.
[02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:54.780]   Like, eyelashes, all complicate things.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:57.180]   So, you know, you can clean stuff up
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:59.380]   just so you have really crisp signal.
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:00.260]   You don't have to.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:02.180]   You can deal with issues,
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:04.960]   but, you know, there's so many hours of Joe Rogan video.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.380]   Anyway, I say all that because I was searching
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:11.620]   for an interesting personal experiment for me
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:14.540]   'cause I saw in drivers,
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.260]   when I was looking at eye movement in drivers,
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:19.300]   it seemed to indicate,
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.660]   there seemed to be quite a lot of signal there
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:25.580]   that indicates amount of cognitive load.
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:28.860]   But it's not clear if there's something conclusive.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:31.940]   But if there is some signal that's a really powerful one
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:35.260]   because eye movement can be detected in the wild,
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:36.460]   like you and I sitting here,
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:38.420]   I can detect eye movement really well.
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:41.420]   Pupil dilation is a really crappy indicator.
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:42.700]   - And it's luminance dependent.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:45.940]   Like if I turn toward a light, it's a route.
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:48.740]   People change size depending on level of alertness
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:51.920]   or autonomic arousal, but also overall levels of luminance.
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.380]   It's very, very hard.
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:56.900]   But there are, I mean, you're sitting on a gold mine
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:00.900]   because there is a lot of interest right now
[02:10:00.900 --> 02:10:05.020]   in measuring state through non-contact sensing.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.700]   Heart rate variability through changes in skin tone,
[02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.260]   but just off a camera, can you imagine that?
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:11.200]   The point where you just look at some video
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:13.100]   and you're like, oh, they're getting more stressed
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.180]   or worked up and they're not,
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:16.740]   based on a heat map of some little patch on their face.
[02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:18.940]   'Cause everyone's gonna have this slight,
[02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:21.000]   sort of compartmentalize it slightly differently,
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.500]   but you can learn it pretty quickly.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.060]   We know this when someone's like giving a talk
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:27.220]   and we see them starting a blotching on their neck.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:31.240]   You know, this is the thesis defense response, right?
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:34.020]   We know it and it's a stressful situation
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:37.540]   'cause not passing your thesis defense is rough.
[02:10:37.540 --> 02:10:38.760]   And we can see that,
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.800]   but cameras can pick that up really easily
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:43.860]   at much lower levels than the blatant blotching
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:44.700]   kind of effect.
[02:10:44.700 --> 02:10:49.180]   And eye movements certainly are powerful indications
[02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:51.580]   of the state of the autonomic system.
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:54.740]   - So what do you, do you think there are things
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.340]   from a high level that you can pick up
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:58.780]   from eye movement and blinking?
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.100]   - Well, blink frequency is gonna increase
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:04.300]   as people get tired, right?
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:06.320]   I mean, I've actually been teased a lot online
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.660]   'cause I don't blink much when I'll do a post.
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.980]   And so I did a whole post about blinking,
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:11.900]   about the science of blinking.
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:13.700]   There's some data, very strong data,
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:16.700]   not from my lab that show that every time you blink,
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:18.380]   it resets your perception of time.
[02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:21.260]   They have people do these kind of track up
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.460]   kind of a Doppler like thing.
[02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:25.300]   And anyway, blinking resets your perception of time.
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:26.900]   There's a dopaminergic mechanism
[02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:29.600]   in the blink related circuitry of the brain.
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:31.420]   When people are very alert,
[02:11:31.420 --> 02:11:32.540]   they tend to not blink very much.
[02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:33.920]   When we're sleepy, we tend to blink more
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:35.340]   and our eyes tend to close.
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:37.020]   Now, some people are more hooded
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.420]   in the way their eyes sit.
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:40.620]   Some people are like this all the time.
[02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:41.740]   There are some very famous people.
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:44.180]   I'm not gonna name them because I might run into them
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:47.020]   at some point who are like accused of being sociopaths
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:48.740]   'cause they don't blink very often.
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:51.040]   But they might just have high levels of autonomic arousal.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:53.340]   They just don't blink very much.
[02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.980]   Also depends on how lubricated the eyes are.
[02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:57.500]   So I think within individual,
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.100]   you can get a lot of information.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:01.740]   I don't think we can say this person's blinking a lot.
[02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:03.700]   They're lying, this person or they're tired.
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.180]   This person doesn't blink.
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:07.120]   They're stressed.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:10.340]   I think if you understand that person's baseline,
[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:11.180]   you can get it.
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:13.900]   And presumably, well, having been on the Joe Rogan
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:15.660]   experience, I can say when you first sit down there,
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:17.020]   if you've never been in there before.
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.460]   - You're in my dataset, by the way.
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:19.580]   - Oh my.
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:22.420]   Well, I bet you, I will admit to being,
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:23.980]   first time sitting down there.
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:25.700]   I mean, Joe is incredibly gracious,
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:27.100]   made me feel very comfortable there.
[02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:30.120]   But yeah, it's an intense experience.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:31.260]   It's a small space too.
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:33.860]   Anytime you enter a small space from a big space
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:38.060]   in his old studio, you're familiar with.
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:39.180]   There's a breaking in period
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.820]   where you're getting to know somebody.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:43.580]   And so I'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:46.140]   front of the podcast were higher than later.
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:48.380]   But once you have a baseline established,
[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:52.820]   you can get a lot of data on somebody simply from blinks.
[02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:54.780]   Some people averting gaze too.
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:56.860]   If you have both people, that's really powerful.
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:58.100]   This is the Holy Grail,
[02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.060]   another Holy Grail of neuroscience.
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:03.020]   We've mainly looked at subjects in isolation.
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.820]   There hasn't been much brain imaging
[02:13:04.820 --> 02:13:06.720]   of two people interacting,
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.100]   or even in animal models of two mice
[02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:10.380]   or two monkeys interacting.
[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:13.500]   It's all like person scanner, bite bar.
[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:14.780]   I mean, if you've ever been in one of these scanners,
[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:16.240]   you're like in a bite bar.
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:17.620]   It's very medieval.
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:19.620]   - And so you think in the interaction,
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.180]   there's actually, you can almost study them
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:24.420]   as a single brain or as a single system.
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:26.300]   The two brains are a single system.
[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:28.020]   - I think with AI- - Highly correlated.
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:30.100]   - Yeah, maybe are your blinks triggering my blinks?
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:32.700]   Like, you know, are your non-blink epochs,
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:35.220]   you know, extending my non-blink epochs?
[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:38.100]   There's a fascinating space to explore there
[02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.180]   and no one's done it.
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:43.740]   And 'cause everyone let the Joe Rogan Experience archive
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:45.260]   disappear except for you.
[02:13:45.260 --> 02:13:46.100]   You grabbed- - Well, actually-
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:47.180]   - Did you get the comments too?
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:49.700]   Because I think the comments were almost as entertaining
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:50.660]   as the conversation.
[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:53.080]   - You know what you just made me realize with the couplings?
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.580]   I have a better data set than the Joe Rogan podcast
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:56.940]   with high resolution video,
[02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:59.580]   which is the raw video for this podcast.
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.060]   So for example, both cameras right now
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:05.460]   are recording you and I full feed.
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:07.740]   The final result will switch cameras back and forth,
[02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:09.660]   but I have the full feed.
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.900]   So I can have the blinking for both you and I
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:12.740]   the whole time.
[02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:16.380]   - I bet you people trigger blinks in one another,
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:19.300]   you know, and there's also like the simplest way
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.580]   to think about the blinks and the attentional thing
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:25.520]   and the alertness is two fighters in the standoff.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:27.900]   There's this whole lore around who blinks first.
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:28.740]   - Yeah. - It's like,
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:29.560]   they blink first.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.820]   Well, what are we really asking?
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:35.140]   They're asking whether or not one person can maintain focus
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:36.720]   longer than the other person,
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.460]   which is an important parameter.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.620]   It's not the only parameter,
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:42.700]   but it's an important parameter.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.100]   And so that blinking contest,
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:46.700]   even though they don't square off as a blinking contest,
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:48.960]   it's well known that the first to blink
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.300]   is revealing something about their capacity
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:52.560]   to hold attention.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.140]   - You've started an amazing podcast
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:57.980]   that we've mentioned a few times.
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:14:59.860]   People should definitely check it out.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:02.540]   It's called the "Human and Man Lab Podcast."
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:06.160]   It does your, it's basically,
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:10.940]   it embodies the personality of Andrew Kuberman,
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.320]   which is like, makes science accessible,
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.760]   but also fascinating and giving it,
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.500]   like, what do you call it?
[02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:25.780]   You give tools for everyday life,
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.940]   meaning it kind of grounds it in like,
[02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:32.140]   what the hell does this mean for my life?
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:35.360]   But then also does the beauty of science at the same time.
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:40.360]   So I love both the rigor and the openness of the whole thing
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:42.840]   plus the whole corrections thing that we mentioned.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.500]   Anyway, what's been the hardest part of this whole process?
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:52.420]   You're one of, already, one of the only,
[02:15:52.420 --> 02:15:56.540]   and one of the best science podcasters out there.
[02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:59.820]   So in that process, what's been the hardest,
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:01.460]   what's been the most exciting part?
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:02.340]   - Wow.
[02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.860]   Well, first of all, thanks for the kind words
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:05.700]   about the podcast.
[02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:07.060]   It was inspired by you.
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:11.540]   I absolutely, that's no BS.
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:14.780]   The last time we met to do an interview for your podcast,
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:15.820]   we talked a little bit about it,
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:19.360]   and you gave me the subtle nudge
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.740]   that maybe there was a podcast there,
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.000]   and I thought about it, and I left,
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.740]   and I was just like, I got to do this thing.
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:26.820]   And you really gave me the encouragement to do it.
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:30.260]   And your podcast, this podcast, has really forged the way.
[02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:34.180]   You've been tip of the spear on serious,
[02:16:34.180 --> 02:16:37.620]   scientific, intellectual, yet fun, accessible conversation.
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:42.620]   And so I, as your colleague and friend,
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:45.480]   but just even if those things weren't true,
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:48.580]   like this podcast was and is the inspiration.
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:49.740]   There's no question. - Thank you so much.
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:52.040]   - Yeah, I really, like 100%.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:54.980]   And when I decided to do the podcast,
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.420]   the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:58.940]   I thought really long and hard about what would work best
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:00.340]   and would be most beneficial.
[02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:02.120]   Turned out to be the hardest thing,
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:04.460]   which is to stay on a single topic
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:06.600]   for three or four more episodes
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:08.660]   before switching to a new topic.
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:12.920]   Because I know from the experience of university
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:16.460]   and teaching in university, as you know as well,
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:19.420]   that there's always the temptation
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:20.740]   to pivot to something else,
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:23.540]   but the drilling into something really deeply
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:25.860]   is where the gems reside.
[02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:29.580]   And the challenge has been how to make it interesting,
[02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:31.300]   how to keep people on board,
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:33.560]   how to give people tools along the way,
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.680]   but also stay close to the scientific data.
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:39.700]   I like to think that we're headed in the right direction.
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:43.940]   It still needs to evolve, but that's been a challenge.
[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:47.780]   I think I also am challenged by the fact
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:50.780]   that there's a tremendous range of backgrounds of listeners.
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:53.520]   So some people have asked for more names,
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:55.700]   like more bits and parts of the nervous system
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.560]   and cellular molecular mechanisms
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:58.460]   and all that kind of thing.
[02:17:58.460 --> 02:17:59.340]   And other people have said,
[02:17:59.340 --> 02:18:00.900]   "I don't understand any of that stuff,
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:02.220]   but I think I'm keeping up."
[02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:04.100]   And so unlike a university course
[02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:05.260]   where there are prerequisites
[02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:06.640]   and everyone's coming to the table
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.380]   with more or less the same knowledge,
[02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:10.880]   I have a very limited sense of what the audience knows
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:11.940]   and doesn't know.
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:13.540]   So that's why I incorporated the feature
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:15.780]   of the comment section on YouTube
[02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:18.080]   being a source of feedback.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.900]   And I do a kind of an office hours-like episode
[02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:23.180]   every third or fourth episode
[02:18:23.180 --> 02:18:25.480]   where I address common questions.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:29.100]   And I think that the podcast space in my mind,
[02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.540]   at least for the sort of podcasts I'm doing,
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:34.500]   needed a venue for the listeners
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:37.260]   to be a more integral part of the experience
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:38.820]   as opposed to just commenting
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.500]   on what they liked or didn't like.
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.660]   So while I like to hear what people liked and didn't like,
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:44.140]   I also really like to hear about,
[02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:46.920]   "Hey, tell me more about temperature minimums
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.220]   and how they can be used to phase shifts,
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:50.220]   circadian rhythms, or whatever it is."
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.920]   And I realized that I'm probably losing
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:52.900]   some people along the way,
[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:56.280]   but hopefully at the end of each month,
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.040]   and because of the way that the episodes are archived,
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.920]   people will come away feeling as if they've learned a ton
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.760]   and they have tools that they can implement.
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.960]   And perhaps most importantly,
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.640]   that they're starting to think scientifically
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:10.760]   about the tons of other stuff that's out there.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:12.120]   So that's been the challenge,
[02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.440]   and it's still really early days.
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:18.200]   But, and of course there's also an attentional challenge.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.440]   I realize that people are busy.
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.200]   Not everyone has two hours to listen to a podcast
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:24.020]   about jet lag and shift work,
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:27.120]   and raising kids and sleep and that kind of thing.
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:27.960]   I'm not raising kids,
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:30.360]   but I did a whole thing about babies and sleep with,
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:32.460]   you know, and how parents can manage their sleep
[02:19:32.460 --> 02:19:33.880]   when kids aren't sleeping.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.640]   So it's been, I'm hacking through the jungle
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:41.440]   of all this stuff, but, and I'll come right back to,
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:46.440]   my inspiration and my North star on this
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:52.220]   is getting to a point where the audience
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:54.740]   that listens to this feels the same way that I do
[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.420]   when I listen to your podcast.
[02:19:56.420 --> 02:19:57.260]   - Thank you so much.
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:58.940]   - Like when I turn into your podcast,
[02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:00.080]   I'm going to embarrass you a little bit more
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.020]   by complimenting you a little bit more,
[02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:05.620]   but not out of a sadistic thing.
[02:20:05.620 --> 02:20:08.140]   But just because when I tune into your podcast
[02:20:08.140 --> 02:20:09.780]   or Joe's podcast,
[02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:11.980]   I have the same sensation that other people have.
[02:20:11.980 --> 02:20:15.500]   Like, I feel like I'm home of sorts.
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.340]   I'm like, I'm familiar with the space
[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:19.580]   and I'd like people to feel comfortable
[02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:21.660]   in the space that is the Hubert and Lab Podcast,
[02:20:21.660 --> 02:20:23.320]   whatever that ends up being.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.820]   - Yeah, that's the magic of podcasting.
[02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:28.060]   It's like, I feel like I'm part of your life now
[02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:32.280]   in a way that as a fan, that I wouldn't be otherwise.
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:35.660]   And, you know, like I never was able to have that
[02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.840]   with Carl Sagan, for example, you know?
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:42.180]   And that's a whole nother level of connection
[02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:44.300]   with a human being that gets you excited.
[02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:46.260]   And then I share your excitement
[02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:49.900]   about different topics in neuroscience
[02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:54.620]   or just biology in general.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.860]   And then I don't have to actually understand
[02:20:56.860 --> 02:21:00.840]   everything you're saying to really enjoy it.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:03.700]   So that's the magic of podcasting is like,
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:05.620]   you can go through like 10 minutes
[02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:08.340]   and understanding what the hell a person is saying.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:11.540]   And then you enjoy the excitement
[02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:12.980]   and then you reconnect to a thing
[02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:15.340]   that you do understand what they're saying.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:19.940]   And, you know, that personal coupled
[02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:22.580]   with the scientific rigor is magic.
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:24.940]   And finding the right, it's exploration.
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:27.720]   Like Joe found something that works for comedians,
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:31.000]   which is like, you know, having a good laugh,
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.820]   but also every once in a while,
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:35.460]   talking seriously about difficult topics.
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:40.300]   The scientific space, it was unclear.
[02:21:40.300 --> 02:21:42.500]   You haven't had guests on yet.
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:43.340]   But-
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:45.060]   - Maybe you'll come on as our first guest.
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:46.060]   - I was gonna invite my,
[02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:48.180]   I was gonna try to force myself in there.
[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:50.220]   - I am officially inviting you now.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:52.020]   Will you come on the podcast as a guest?
[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:52.860]   - I would love to.
[02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:53.700]   - Fantastic.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:55.660]   - But it was hard.
[02:21:55.660 --> 02:21:58.660]   It's still a little bit difficult to tell people
[02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:01.060]   that, no, you don't get it.
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:03.900]   We're not gonna talk for 10 minutes.
[02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:07.300]   We're gonna talk for three or four hours.
[02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:09.060]   It's a different, for scientists,
[02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:12.340]   for like, they're like, what are we gonna talk about?
[02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:14.180]   - I think it's like the NPR interview.
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.020]   - Yes.
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:18.460]   And they don't realize, first of all,
[02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:19.700]   I think at his best,
[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:21.980]   if you're like at the level of Joe Rogan,
[02:22:21.980 --> 02:22:24.280]   who I think is an excellent conversationalist,
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:27.500]   you just lose track of time.
[02:22:27.500 --> 02:22:29.140]   It can be three, four, five hours
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.340]   and you lose track of time.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:31.860]   I'm still not there.
[02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:34.100]   I find that it's still painful.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:36.940]   Like the conversation is still challenging sometimes.
[02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:39.340]   You don't lose quite as much track of time.
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:40.780]   It's still an intellectual effort.
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.380]   And I think it might always be as it would be with you
[02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:45.780]   because you're talking about difficult topics,
[02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:47.300]   maybe that require more brain.
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:49.740]   You're not just shooting the shit
[02:22:49.740 --> 02:22:52.380]   with like a Brian Redband or somebody like comedians
[02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:53.500]   or just joking.
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:55.300]   - What's like, remember those shows,
[02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:59.260]   like where those shows where someone would come out
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:02.380]   and like spin plates and they're running back and forth.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:05.700]   Really good scientific discussion is like that.
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:07.980]   You have to be maintaining three or four
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:10.740]   different logical arguments and jumping back and forth.
[02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:13.860]   It's occasionally get into like a real streak of linearity.
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:17.260]   But as we found today that typically there's three
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:18.620]   or four different things that we're bouncing back
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:19.460]   and forth from.
[02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:21.820]   And that requires a lot of updating of these,
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.020]   you know, four brain circuits.
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:25.900]   It's not a passive listening experience.
[02:23:25.900 --> 02:23:28.820]   But I like to think that the brain likes that.
[02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:31.940]   - I do want to ask just 'cause we all,
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:36.200]   I don't want to forget the question came up to me,
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:40.500]   is your podcast has the same kind of rigor
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:43.340]   that I think like a Dan Carlin podcast has
[02:23:43.340 --> 02:23:45.080]   who's a history podcaster.
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:47.900]   - Well, that's definitely a compliment.
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:48.740]   Thank you.
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:52.260]   Dan's way, you know, he's something for me to aspire to.
[02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:54.460]   - He goes through hell to prepare.
[02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:56.300]   He spends months preparing.
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:01.140]   It feels like you've had to really prepare for your podcast.
[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:02.980]   - I definitely prepare hard.
[02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:05.500]   - How, is that, are you okay?
[02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:07.460]   - Yeah, I--
[02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:09.500]   - I mean, how much effort does that take?
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:11.580]   It feels like a conference presentation.
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.300]   - Yeah, so we record once a week
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:15.340]   and in the intervening time,
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:20.340]   I listen to many university level lectures.
[02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:25.160]   So NIH has a bank of lectures.
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:29.000]   I have some sources of recorded university seminars.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.020]   I'm trying to find the points of intersection.
[02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:33.700]   So like for four episodes on sleep,
[02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:36.580]   it's not like I'm gonna just regurgitate a popular book
[02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:39.380]   or take one lecture and just, you know, poach the content.
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:43.500]   I'm gonna find the overlap in the different elements.
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:47.220]   I also, so what I'll do is I'll generally read
[02:24:47.220 --> 02:24:49.340]   10 or 15 different papers.
[02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:52.100]   And generally those are good reviews, annual reviews,
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:53.140]   interview of neuroscience,
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:55.540]   annual review of physiology, those kinds of things.
[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:56.820]   I'll chase a few references.
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.320]   I'll listen to some YouTube videos,
[02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.460]   but of university level lectures.
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:03.380]   And then I throw all that on a whiteboard,
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.780]   usually while I work out in the morning.
[02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:06.860]   I'll just be working out.
[02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:07.900]   I have a gym in my house
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.260]   and I'll just put up all these random ideas.
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:12.340]   I want to cover that, dreams, hallucination.
[02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:14.660]   And then I take that and I start eliminating,
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:17.180]   I draw lines between the common points of intersection.
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:21.380]   And then from that, I distill out an outline.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:25.020]   And then I basically think about what I want to say
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:27.220]   on my walks with my dog.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:29.260]   And I bother a couple of people and blab to them.
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:31.140]   So I would say each podcast, yeah,
[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:33.180]   I put in 10 to 15 hours at least
[02:25:33.180 --> 02:25:35.620]   of passive listening preparation
[02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:38.700]   and maybe five or six of active preparation.
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:40.880]   So I do prepare quite a lot,
[02:25:40.880 --> 02:25:44.460]   but it has a certain reward component for me.
[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:46.100]   To come up at the end with something
[02:25:46.100 --> 02:25:50.160]   that's somewhat crystallized for me is just so satisfying.
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:52.860]   It feel like there's something about my dopamine circuits
[02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:54.500]   that just love that.
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.040]   And the only pain is that a year later,
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:00.140]   after I've talked about this stuff a bunch of times,
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:04.220]   it's so much more succinct, but that's life.
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:05.780]   At some point, you gotta pull the trigger.
[02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:08.420]   - Well, I don't know what you think,
[02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:11.300]   but for me, YouTube is,
[02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:13.420]   that's why I'm sad that Joe left YouTube.
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:17.020]   There's a archival nature to YouTube that's kind of magical.
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:18.720]   And so I'm really glad you're now,
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.720]   you were doing a lot of educational content
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.440]   on Instagram before,
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:29.220]   but now doing this podcast thing on YouTube,
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:32.280]   it's like Feynman lectures.
[02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:35.860]   I'm not saying every podcast,
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:38.500]   but there will be, you will have some,
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:42.340]   I can already tell, there'll be some lectures
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:47.340]   which are definitive, really special ones.
[02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:48.180]   - That's the hope.
[02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:51.740]   - And there's some aspect that's archival to YouTube
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:54.860]   where, at least I hope, 20 years from now,
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:58.220]   some kid is gonna watch a lecture of yours
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.860]   and it'll create the next Nobel Prize.
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:07.860]   It'll create another dream that then becomes a reality.
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:12.580]   And that's a special thing that YouTube provides.
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:14.100]   So I'm really excited that you're on YouTube.
[02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:15.580]   And at the same time,
[02:27:15.580 --> 02:27:17.460]   I'm excited to see where this thing goes
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:22.460]   because it seems like change is the cliched thing,
[02:27:22.460 --> 02:27:25.340]   that change is the only constant in these times
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:29.920]   because you're paving with this podcast,
[02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:31.180]   with this creativity,
[02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:32.900]   what you were doing on Instagram as well,
[02:27:32.900 --> 02:27:37.180]   you're paving the new era of what it means to do science.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:39.500]   So actively doing research
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.540]   and actively explaining that research in new media.
[02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:43.940]   It's very interesting.
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:47.220]   - I'm inspired, genuinely inspired by you.
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:49.100]   We had this discussion last time
[02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.500]   after the podcast recording,
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:54.580]   and it's clear that communication of science
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:58.700]   cannot be left to the existing institutions.
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:27:59.840]   And I'm not talking about universities,
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:02.700]   I just mean that the science section of newspapers is,
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:05.180]   sometimes there's some gems there,
[02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:08.060]   but generally it goes, you know,
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.380]   and I think you really have to know a field
[02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:13.660]   in order to extract the best things from that field.
[02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:16.760]   And my hope is that other practicing scientists
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:19.080]   and people finishing their PhD and postdoc
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:20.340]   and people who are running labs
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:22.220]   or working at companies will start to do this.
[02:28:22.220 --> 02:28:24.140]   I mean, how amazing would it be, for instance,
[02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:29.140]   if someone at Neuralink was giving us hints
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000]   about not necessarily what they're developing,
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.360]   'cause that's complicated for all sorts of reasons,
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:39.360]   but would talk to us about what the real challenges
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:43.680]   of building futuristic brain machine interface are like
[02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:47.040]   and what it means to understand a clinical problem
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:47.860]   and address it.
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:50.720]   I mean, my hope is somebody there might eventually do that,
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:53.680]   that somebody in the world of chemistry
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:55.960]   or synthetic materials or whatever it is
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.800]   will do this in a way that I could understand
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:28:59.900]   'cause I don't have expertise in those.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.260]   I think it would be marvelous.
[02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:05.120]   And you were tip of the spear, you were out first,
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:09.820]   and I'm just happily trying to move along
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:10.760]   in the direction I'm going.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.120]   But I think the future of science education is online.
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:17.380]   And I think that's gonna be scary
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:19.380]   to a lot of existing institutions,
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:21.540]   but it's not about disrupting anything.
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:23.340]   It's just about trying to do things better.
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:28.340]   - Yeah, you know, some of the best interviews,
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:30.880]   some of the best investigative journalism
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:33.640]   is done by people inside the field.
[02:29:33.640 --> 02:29:36.200]   Comes to mind a guy by the name of Elon Musk,
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:40.720]   who I love the possibility that he gets a Pulitzer
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:44.080]   for that interview, but he grilled the crap out of Vlad,
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:47.000]   the CEO of Robinhood, I'm not sure if you remember.
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.400]   - Oh, on-- - Clubhouse.
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.360]   - On Clubhouse the other night.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.840]   Yeah, I saw you guys in there.
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:53.780]   I was kept out, I wasn't quick enough.
[02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:55.280]   My thumb's doesn't go fast enough,
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:57.480]   so I was, and I wasn't about to sit in the waiting room.
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:59.160]   - Have you tried that social network, by the way,
[02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:00.040]   the Clubhouse?
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:03.040]   - I've gone in there a few times and checked some things out.
[02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:05.040]   I'm there, I have a few questions about it
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:07.920]   that like if I'm in there,
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.640]   how one can participate or not participate.
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:13.880]   I like being a fly on the wall for those conversations.
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.760]   I've been very curious as to what's going on in there.
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:18.600]   - Oh, it's quite, I mean, I have a lot of thoughts.
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:20.980]   Maybe it's useful to comment.
[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:25.980]   I also have a Discord server that has a few tens
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:27.560]   of thousands of people on it,
[02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:31.840]   and then they have also a voice chat capability.
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:34.040]   So they have these get togethers.
[02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:37.720]   And I was using it in the spring and summer,
[02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:40.680]   like actively on those voice discussions,
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:44.960]   and it's anywhere from 10 to like 1,000 people
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:46.520]   all together in voice.
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.200]   Like anyone can speak anytime, right?
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:52.300]   But there's this weird dynamic that people stay quiet
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:54.140]   and only one person speaks at a time
[02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:55.540]   'cause they're all like respectful.
[02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:59.260]   And it's a community of like fundamentally
[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:01.860]   respectful people, even though they're all anonymous.
[02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:04.940]   So like, except like me and a few others,
[02:31:04.940 --> 02:31:06.260]   it's all anonymous people.
[02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:07.100]   - So interesting.
[02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:08.300]   - And it works.
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:13.180]   But the magical thing to me about that community
[02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:17.460]   was how intimate voice only communication can be.
[02:31:18.500 --> 02:31:23.500]   It felt as intimate as like a small get together
[02:31:23.500 --> 02:31:27.740]   at a home with close friends.
[02:31:27.740 --> 02:31:29.900]   It felt like there's a calmness to it,
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:33.720]   and you're revealing things about, you know,
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.180]   somebody suffering from depression or being suicidal.
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:38.620]   So those are the dark things,
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:42.140]   or being super excited getting a new girlfriend or boyfriend.
[02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:46.600]   Like just the depth of human experience shared on voice
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:49.840]   without video is, I was really surprised
[02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:52.040]   how intimate that is for human connection,
[02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:54.480]   especially in this time of COVID, it replaced that.
[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:57.480]   So that, so just to give you some context,
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.120]   there's something there.
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:00.120]   - There's definitely something there.
[02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:03.120]   One thing that comes to mind is when like in Clubhouse,
[02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:05.120]   you have your little icon, so they don't actually,
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:06.440]   you don't see your face moving.
[02:32:06.440 --> 02:32:08.840]   I think when people see their own image,
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:11.580]   it puts them in a state of self-consciousness
[02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:14.920]   that is eliminated by just having an icon or an avatar.
[02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:15.760]   - Yes.
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:18.480]   - So like Zoom is dreadful,
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:21.000]   because if I'm not used to talking to people
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.440]   and seeing a little image of myself
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:24.320]   staring back at me in a mirror,
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.560]   and it's just, I know there are ways
[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:29.200]   that you can adjust that, but it's really awful.
[02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:32.240]   And I think that when I get on Zooms now, I say hello,
[02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:34.520]   and then I shut down the video component,
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:35.640]   and then I just talk in the end,
[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:38.840]   I come back on just to show that still there, it's still me.
[02:32:38.840 --> 02:32:42.120]   But I think that voice only is really interesting.
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:43.840]   Eddie Chang would be an interesting person
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:44.660]   to talk to about this,
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:45.960]   because he understands so much
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:48.320]   about how inflection communicates
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.160]   emotionality and deeper state.
[02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.240]   - But there's a balance between,
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:53.720]   I think just like you said,
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:58.720]   the privacy somehow allows for the intimacy.
[02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:03.240]   So like being able to, as opposed to putting on an act,
[02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.440]   which I realize we do
[02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:06.400]   when we're visually presenting ourselves
[02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:08.300]   in remote communication.
[02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:10.040]   But I think that there's so few places
[02:33:10.040 --> 02:33:12.280]   where people can actually communicate
[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:14.240]   without the fear of penalty.
[02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:15.080]   - Yes.
[02:33:15.080 --> 02:33:19.280]   - That's woefully absent these days.
[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:21.200]   And so maybe people are just relieved
[02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:23.000]   to be in a place where they feel like,
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:26.440]   I can say what I want or not say anything, and it's okay.
[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:29.760]   - And so Clubhouse, to answer your kind of question,
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.160]   is it was a big improvement to me over Discord,
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:35.200]   which is it has tiers.
[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:37.800]   It has a stage where people,
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:40.320]   the person that created the room can invite people up
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:42.640]   that would like to speak potentially,
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:43.840]   have the opportunity to speak.
[02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:45.920]   And then there's a bigger audience
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:47.440]   that don't get a chance to speak
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.040]   unless they click raise their hand and they get called on.
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:56.040]   So there's like a tier system that allows for there to be
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:34:00.280]   a group of like five, 10, 20, 30 people talking
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:03.400]   and a lot larger amount in the audience,
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:04.640]   which in Discord was a problem
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:06.040]   was that everybody could talk.
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:07.680]   And the other thing about Clubhouse
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:11.600]   is everybody is strongly encouraged to represent themselves.
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:13.160]   So you're using your real name.
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:14.960]   It's not anonymous.
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:18.120]   - How many people were in that GameStop discussion
[02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:18.960]   the other day?
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:23.320]   - They currently limit rooms to 5,000.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:25.280]   So I'm sure maxed out at 5,000.
[02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:27.640]   There's a lot of overflow rooms.
[02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:29.440]   This is the cool thing about Clubhouse,
[02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:32.200]   really big people were on there all tuned in
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:33.520]   and having a conversation,
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:37.960]   having all from all these different worlds,
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:39.680]   being able to connect,
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:41.640]   even though without the niceties
[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:43.200]   of like arranging the meeting,
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.800]   you could just show up and leave, which is nice.
[02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:50.260]   But the reason for my lessons from Discord,
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:54.080]   I'm going to mostly stay away from Clubhouse.
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:56.120]   And I think--
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:58.080]   - Or go in there under another name.
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:34:58.920]   - Right.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.600]   - I'll pretend I know your actual name on Clubhouse.
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:03.440]   - Yeah.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:04.640]   (laughing)
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:06.960]   I've learned it's quite addicting.
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:08.560]   It's a time sink.
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.840]   It's so, the intimacy of it is,
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:14.160]   you find yourself wasting quite a bit of time on there.
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:15.520]   It pulls you in.
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:16.800]   - Well, it's interesting.
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:20.800]   The, in sort of going back to the podcast
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:22.480]   or earlier we're talking about books
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:24.500]   or creating a technology.
[02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:25.920]   One thing that's absolutely clear
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:28.960]   is that anything that's easy to reproduce
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:33.400]   is probably not worth much effort and time.
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:34.240]   - Yes.
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.060]   - Right?
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:39.320]   Most posts could be easily reproduced.
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:40.300]   You just repost them.
[02:35:40.300 --> 02:35:41.140]   - Yeah.
[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:43.600]   - So now there are some original posts
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:46.200]   that for which the attribution goes to the original person.
[02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:48.000]   It's clear it came from you.
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.180]   But anything that can be easily reproduced
[02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:52.820]   is doesn't really expand us very much
[02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:55.300]   as individuals or as groups.
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:56.980]   And most of what I see on social media
[02:35:56.980 --> 02:36:00.420]   is stuff that is purely reproduced.
[02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:01.420]   - Yes.
[02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:05.340]   - But I think Clubhouse, I mean,
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:08.220]   it could be that some real magic emerges on there.
[02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:10.220]   - So in moderation, it could be good.
[02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:12.500]   The magic is, this is another thing
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:15.180]   that I've found through COVID
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:19.520]   that maybe you can think about is live.
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:24.540]   I used to be, not understand the appeal of live video
[02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:28.860]   or live connection or like in this Clubhouse live events
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.420]   because Clubhouse is technically for the most part,
[02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:34.060]   it's not supposed to be recorded.
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.540]   Most people don't record most conversations.
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:38.580]   It's a one-time live event.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.260]   And there's a magic to that.
[02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:41.100]   - There is.
[02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:44.660]   - That's not captured by a, like your podcast
[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:49.360]   or my podcast produced video that's like recorded,
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.980]   like packaged up.
[02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:52.440]   - Well, anything can happen.
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:54.220]   It's that anything can happen.
[02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:57.380]   And that's the kind of thing like live concerts.
[02:36:57.380 --> 02:37:00.440]   I definitely, I love live music.
[02:37:00.440 --> 02:37:02.060]   And it's the idea that,
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:03.420]   'cause you can always listen to the album.
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:05.860]   Actually, the album usually sounds cleaner and better,
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:08.300]   but it's just this idea that anything can happen.
[02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:10.740]   - And then you listen to like the parts, I don't know,
[02:37:10.740 --> 02:37:13.820]   you like Costello did something weird,
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:15.200]   your dog did something weird.
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:17.020]   And then you have to go, God damn it.
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:19.020]   You have to go to the kitchen or something
[02:37:19.020 --> 02:37:21.520]   to get something and then you come back.
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.620]   And it's funny, I watched live video like that of people
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:26.380]   and I'll be there for the whole time.
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:28.820]   I'll wait for them to go to the kitchen and come back.
[02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:30.700]   It's not like I tune out.
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:33.500]   And that makes it like a richer experience for some reason.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:34.340]   It's weird.
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.380]   - Well, it humanizes it.
[02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:36.420]   - Yeah, humanizes it.
[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:38.260]   - And I think there is this weird effect
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:40.260]   of whether or not it's a podcast, Instagram,
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:41.300]   or Twitter or anything else.
[02:37:41.300 --> 02:37:44.500]   There's kind of like two people shouting into a tunnel
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:45.840]   and then a bunch of people with ears
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:47.120]   at the other end of those tunnels
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:49.140]   and shouting some things back.
[02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:52.060]   You know, that's kind of the format we're in.
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:54.140]   I think, I'll check out Clubhouse again.
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:55.620]   I've gone in there a few times during the day
[02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:57.500]   and I was surprised to see how many people were in there
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:37:58.620]   in the middle of the day.
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:01.340]   I was like, "Aren't these people supposed to be working?"
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:02.420]   But maybe that is their work.
[02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:07.100]   - Well, be very careful about the time sink of it.
[02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:09.140]   But yeah, if you wanna, you and I go together,
[02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:10.780]   we'll have a conversation on there.
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:13.380]   But one of the things you have to figure out,
[02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:16.540]   I don't still know how to do it, but how to exit.
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:18.420]   - Which is you just do that.
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:20.320]   Isn't there the leave quietly button?
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.580]   - Yeah, no, but like when you and I are on stage
[02:38:22.580 --> 02:38:23.940]   having a conversation.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.820]   Like, okay, you and I is harder,
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:31.260]   but like you really, if it's just you and I,
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:33.700]   then it's the usual human communication of like,
[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:35.300]   "All right, I gotta go."
[02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:38.140]   Like, but when it's like four people,
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:40.140]   you don't wanna interrupt everyone
[02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:41.020]   and ask you're leaving.
[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:43.220]   You just have to, I mean, there's a weird dynamic
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:46.060]   that I haven't quite figured out of--
[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:47.180]   - The etiquette isn't clear.
[02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:48.340]   - The etiquette is not clear.
[02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:52.100]   - Well, the etiquette on different platforms
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.140]   and how that changes is really interesting.
[02:38:54.140 --> 02:38:56.380]   You know, how YouTube has one etiquette,
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:58.900]   which is kind of, a lot of harshness is tolerated
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:01.260]   on YouTube video comments.
[02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:03.980]   Twitter seems a bit harsher than Instagram.
[02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:05.660]   Instagram, there's kind of, it seems to be a little--
[02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:06.500]   - People are nice.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:07.580]   - People are really nice.
[02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:10.420]   People are really nice on Instagram for the most part,
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:13.580]   except for those phishing things.
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:16.900]   I actually know someone who had their quite sizable account
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:18.580]   poached by those copyright.
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:19.740]   They come in with those like,
[02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:21.780]   you violated copyright thing.
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:23.540]   There's all sorts of harshness in there
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:25.340]   that if you think about it in the real world,
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:28.260]   I like to think about Instagram as if it was the real world.
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:30.300]   Someone comes over and is basically saying like,
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:32.500]   "Hey, can I hold your wallet and go into the bank
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:34.100]   and I'll get some money out for you?"
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:37.260]   But there's this trust based on the format it comes in
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:39.220]   that it can almost get past your radar
[02:39:39.220 --> 02:39:40.980]   unless you're suspicious.
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:43.500]   If you took comments, like, you know,
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:46.860]   your posts get a lot of comments and you just walk past
[02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:48.620]   500 random people on the street
[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:50.580]   and just listen to what they say,
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:52.060]   it's like, that's ridiculous.
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:53.580]   I don't have time for that.
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:55.540]   But the comments somehow take on this importance
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:59.220]   and this relevance and we feel obligated
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:00.940]   to give them value, right?
[02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:03.620]   And so the online communities,
[02:40:03.620 --> 02:40:05.760]   the rules really are different.
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:08.220]   - And they evolve with time, which is fascinating.
[02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:10.060]   With Clubhouse, it's a new social network,
[02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:13.820]   so it's evolving and people are figuring out as you go.
[02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:16.500]   And the same thing with podcasting on video
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.220]   and like scientific podcasting.
[02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:22.020]   This is the cool thing when I look at what you've created,
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:23.780]   I'm learning, I'm thinking like,
[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:26.380]   hmm, that's interesting to do it this way.
[02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:29.340]   'Cause like, I have nobody to copy.
[02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:31.260]   Not many people to copy, you know what I mean?
[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:32.560]   - But you threw out an idea,
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:35.280]   I'm not gonna put it out here now 'cause I don't wanna,
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:37.140]   'cause knowing you, you'll hold yourself to it
[02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:37.980]   no matter what.
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:41.740]   But when we talked about this issue of the challenge
[02:40:41.740 --> 02:40:43.940]   of staying on a particular topic for a while,
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:46.220]   I mean, you do have some cool stuff brewing in there.
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:47.060]   - Oh, no, no.
[02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:48.020]   - That's separate from this format.
[02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:49.920]   And I love your interview format,
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:52.020]   but when you told me about that,
[02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:53.980]   I got really excited that you might go forward.
[02:40:53.980 --> 02:40:55.900]   I'm not gonna tell your audience what it is,
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:58.660]   but I will say this, it is super cool.
[02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:00.180]   I would have never thought about it.
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:01.620]   It's distinctly different than what I'm doing
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.300]   or what Lex is currently doing.
[02:41:03.300 --> 02:41:07.460]   And if you decide to do that podcast,
[02:41:07.460 --> 02:41:09.980]   I will be your first and your number one fan.
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:11.220]   And I know there are gonna be millions
[02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:12.540]   of other people interested in that.
[02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:13.900]   It would be amazing.
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:16.920]   So if you decide to go forward with the idea,
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:19.300]   that would be awesome.
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:20.260]   - I was gonna say what it is,
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:22.580]   but now I'm not going to because
[02:41:22.580 --> 02:41:24.020]   that's even more interesting.
[02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:27.500]   I brought up the clubhouse thing actually in Elon
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:31.860]   because I just wanted to get your thoughts
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:34.740]   about something he's said a few times to me
[02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:37.260]   and to me in general,
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:40.100]   is that he's under a huge amount of stress.
[02:41:40.100 --> 02:41:44.540]   And I'm thinking of doing a startup now
[02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:48.020]   and kind of thinking about all of this.
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:51.380]   'Cause I enjoy podcasts, I enjoy science,
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:56.040]   but he says that his life is basically hell.
[02:41:56.040 --> 02:41:57.380]   It's very difficult.
[02:41:57.380 --> 02:41:59.860]   - He looks happy, but he's probably very good at math.
[02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:02.180]   - He's fulfilled, he's fulfilled.
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:06.620]   But the stress levels, the constant fires
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.500]   that he has to put out.
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:11.660]   And he says that most people wouldn't wanna be me.
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:16.160]   And that basically the reason he does what he does
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:19.580]   is because there's probably something wrong with him.
[02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:24.180]   He can't help it, but do that.
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:25.700]   - It's kind of beautiful.
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:29.140]   In a kind of Russian masochistic way.
[02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:31.700]   - Well, I just wonder the stress.
[02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:34.780]   I mean, I'm sure you can imagine
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:36.020]   the kind of stress he's under
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:39.940]   because it's running three plus companies
[02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:41.660]   and there's constant,
[02:42:42.860 --> 02:42:47.080]   he says that every single meeting is not about
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.800]   like should we install a coffee maker in the kitchen?
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:56.260]   It's like, this rocket is going to blow up
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:59.120]   and we're all fucked, I don't know what to do.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.200]   And you have to fix-- - Real problems.
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:04.080]   - Real, big problems that are,
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.760]   and how do you deal with that?
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:09.360]   What do you think about that kind of life?
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:13.100]   One, is there a way to walk through that fire?
[02:43:13.100 --> 02:43:18.940]   And two, should you walk through that fire?
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:22.100]   - Well, I mean, without knowing, I've never met Elon,
[02:43:22.100 --> 02:43:25.740]   but certainly we have common friends in you
[02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:29.660]   and in other people that he worked with long ago,
[02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:33.980]   the PayPal days, all of whom speak very highly of him
[02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:38.640]   and express immense admiration for the number of things
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:40.080]   that he can maintain.
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:43.180]   I think it's fair to say that he accomplishes more
[02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:48.180]   before 9 a.m. than most people do in a decade, it's clear.
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:51.780]   And that what he does would dissolve most people
[02:43:51.780 --> 02:43:54.820]   into a puddle of tears, mostly because of this whole thing
[02:43:54.820 --> 02:43:59.300]   about the brain working hard
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:02.300]   equates to thinking about duration, path, and outcome
[02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:05.040]   and anticipating outcomes given A, B, C, or D,
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.220]   a lot of very scripted linear thinking.
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:11.600]   And prediction, and that is hard, it's stressful,
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:14.300]   it requires intense neurochemical output.
[02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:16.400]   And he's doing that for multiple projects.
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:18.600]   So presumably he's buffered himself
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:21.380]   from the coffee maker issues and the little tiny issues,
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:24.100]   but he is himself, unless there's something I don't know,
[02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:26.380]   he's walking around in a biological system.
[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:29.480]   That's- - Allegedly, yes.
[02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:30.320]   - Yeah, allegedly.
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:33.820]   So, and I don't want to reveal too much here,
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:38.820]   but I have a common co-worker and colleague
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:41.220]   through some contract work I do,
[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:44.280]   that what I can tell you is that he's accessing
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:48.460]   the best resources in terms of how to optimize his biology.
[02:44:48.460 --> 02:44:51.960]   And he's thinking about that, not just for himself,
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:53.500]   but for all of Neuralink.
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:56.180]   Because I think, I'm not trying to dodge the question,
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.580]   but I think there's the scale of the individual,
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:02.780]   but then there's the companies that he's creating.
[02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:05.380]   And you've got people there that you could imagine
[02:45:05.380 --> 02:45:07.780]   if they're working at 10% better capacity
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:12.220]   or can focus 5% better for 20% of the day,
[02:45:12.220 --> 02:45:15.780]   you're looking at an enormous increase in productivity
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:18.100]   and a reduction in the time to reach goals,
[02:45:18.100 --> 02:45:20.420]   which will reduce the amount of stress,
[02:45:20.420 --> 02:45:21.340]   presumably on Elon,
[02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:23.700]   unless he goes and starts another endeavor.
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:27.380]   Right, so I think it's certainly not healthy
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:28.780]   for most people.
[02:45:28.780 --> 02:45:31.300]   It seems to be where he gets his dopamine hits.
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:34.380]   I'm also really struck by the fact that he has a family
[02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:38.220]   and he's got kids growing up and a relationship
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:39.060]   and all that.
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:41.180]   So it's super impressive.
[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:44.860]   I think that, I don't know, how old is Elon?
[02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:49.380]   - He's 40, I mean, pushing 50, I think 48.
[02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:50.500]   - Even more impressive.
[02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:51.340]   - 49.
[02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:55.420]   - Because many people who've been at exceedingly high output
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:58.580]   for a decade or more don't do well.
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:45:59.980]   Their system breaks down.
[02:45:59.980 --> 02:46:02.300]   - Well, this is what he was saying.
[02:46:02.300 --> 02:46:06.820]   Actually, I mean, I don't listen to all of his interviews,
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:09.620]   but on that live on the Clubhouse,
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:13.420]   he mentioned that he was kind of worried.
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:14.660]   It's interesting.
[02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:17.660]   He was worried that sometimes,
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:20.340]   what I think he said is,
[02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:23.740]   "I'm worried that at some point my brain
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.980]   "is just going to fail
[02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:28.780]   "because of the amount of load it's under.
[02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:33.780]   "Like how much I have to think through throughout the day.
[02:46:33.780 --> 02:46:38.260]   "Like how many problems you have to think through."
[02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:39.860]   Like, you know, it's like puzzles.
[02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:41.260]   It's constant puzzle solving.
[02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:43.940]   - I would be concerned about taking somebody
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:46.020]   who's in that regime and suddenly putting them
[02:46:46.020 --> 02:46:47.660]   into a regime where they don't have enough
[02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:48.540]   to bite down into.
[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:49.820]   It's like my bulldog Costello.
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:51.580]   He's happiest when chewing and tugging
[02:46:51.580 --> 02:46:53.220]   with that big old neck of his.
[02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:55.140]   And he is just not going to become a retriever.
[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:57.580]   He's not going to, that he does well
[02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:00.660]   and gets his dopamine hits from chewing and pulling.
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:04.260]   And it seems like Elon has ended up where he is
[02:47:04.260 --> 02:47:07.820]   by way of his natural leanings.
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:11.820]   Unless there's a backstory that's trauma-based
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:15.260]   or something, and I don't even begin to think that there is,
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:16.820]   it seems that he has,
[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.700]   he's one of those rare individuals in history
[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:21.260]   that has an immense drive to create
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:22.680]   in all these different domains.
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:24.380]   I'm just saying the obvious here.
[02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:27.400]   But it seems like that's what makes him tick.
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:29.060]   I mean, you're doing an awful lot too.
[02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:32.020]   - Well, the problem is not really,
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:35.060]   the problem is I'm about,
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:37.180]   I've been on the verge of pulling the trigger
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:40.620]   on starting a company which will increase
[02:47:40.620 --> 02:47:43.200]   the workload significantly.
[02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:48.200]   And I'm attracted to that because of a dream I have,
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:54.200]   but it's a little bit scary because it can destroy you.
[02:47:54.220 --> 02:47:59.140]   In a lot of ways, there's two sources of destruction.
[02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:02.340]   So one source is,
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:06.380]   I've, for the first time in my life,
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:11.380]   a few months ago, I think, have gotten,
[02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:14.100]   this feels like such a noob thing to say,
[02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:16.860]   but I've gotten some hate on the internet.
[02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:17.780]   - No.
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:18.900]   - I know, right? - No.
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:22.460]   - But I'm such an idiot, I'm so naive to,
[02:48:22.460 --> 02:48:27.460]   it was, I had the question that I guess a lot of people
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:29.420]   have when they get hate on the internet.
[02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:32.900]   It's like, "Mom, why are these people
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:35.500]   "making up stuff about me?"
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:39.060]   That kind of feeling of like, "Why are you saying that?"
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:43.460]   And the reason I mention that is like,
[02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:46.380]   well, if you wanna go and start a business
[02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:49.820]   and do as I think people should
[02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:53.420]   when they start a big, ambitious business,
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:55.020]   really try to go big.
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:58.060]   What does success look like
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:00.780]   in terms of your emotional journey?
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:02.580]   You're going to have a lot of people
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:06.700]   who make up stuff about you, who say negative things.
[02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:09.300]   I mean, majority, hopefully, if you do a good job,
[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:11.980]   will be supportive, but there's still going to be
[02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:13.460]   this army of people.
[02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:18.460]   And that was scary to me because of how much
[02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:20.540]   emotional impact that had on me.
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:22.860]   - Well, and I also know a little bit,
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:24.900]   I have some glimpse into the fact that you put
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:27.280]   your heart and soul into everything you do.
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:30.620]   You're not a, you're lighthearted about certain things,
[02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:33.060]   but you're even lighthearted about being
[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:35.980]   full gas pedal 24/7.
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:38.860]   There's kind of this, was it,
[02:49:38.860 --> 02:49:42.220]   was it Laird Hamilton always says,
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:45.300]   the big wave surfer, he always says,
[02:49:45.300 --> 02:49:46.780]   "Bright light, dark shadow."
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:50.780]   And I think it's that intensity.
[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:53.180]   And when you do that, and then suddenly
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:56.420]   people are starting to throw some paint on your picture.
[02:49:56.420 --> 02:49:58.020]   You're like, "Wait, hold up."
[02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:00.100]   You're going max capacity.
[02:50:00.100 --> 02:50:02.260]   But I think the company is an interesting one
[02:50:02.260 --> 02:50:05.140]   because you've talked about doing this company before.
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:05.960]   - I've been afraid.
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.380]   I've just not been pulling the trigger out of fear
[02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:10.500]   'cause I enjoy this life.
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.140]   This is, and sorry to interrupt,
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:15.960]   but it's ultimately this question of taking a leap.
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:20.720]   It's like, say you're in academia, like you're at MIT.
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:23.820]   I really love doing research at MIT.
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:25.620]   I really love that life.
[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:27.580]   Why take a leap out?
[02:50:27.580 --> 02:50:30.480]   But I did because it's been a dream.
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:33.340]   But now accidentally along the way,
[02:50:33.340 --> 02:50:35.820]   I found this podcasting thing,
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:37.900]   which is also really fulfilling.
[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:41.180]   And it's like, why take a leap?
[02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:44.220]   - 'Cause you have a huge lust for life.
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:45.060]   - Yeah.
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:47.480]   - I mean, sometimes when I'm on the internet
[02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:49.360]   and I think, you hear about it, like,
[02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:50.660]   "Oh, it's addicting.
[02:50:50.660 --> 02:50:52.100]   YouTube's addicting."
[02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:54.760]   Actually, sometimes I think maybe that's true.
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:57.840]   But a lot of times I just think there's so much here.
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:50:59.560]   There's a lot of garbage,
[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:02.860]   but there's so many gems out there in the world now.
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:06.600]   It's almost like, sure, how you allocate time is key,
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:10.160]   but I think you can do it all.
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:14.560]   Not maybe not five more things, but all.
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:16.260]   - And one thing, I just had this idea,
[02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:18.460]   and this is not grounded in any scientific paper,
[02:51:18.460 --> 02:51:20.280]   but I think the answer might come to you
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:23.700]   during this torture that you're about
[02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:25.360]   to put yourself through with David.
[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:26.860]   Because in those mental states,
[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:29.340]   you're really asking the question, right?
[02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:32.620]   You're asking the question, where is my capacity?
[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:35.580]   And am I even close to my capacity?
[02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:37.980]   And if I am, what's of the most value?
[02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:40.340]   I think we find the answers to those things
[02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:43.560]   in those nonverbal, nonanalytic states.
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.940]   It just comes to us.
[02:51:45.940 --> 02:51:46.960]   - I hope you're right,
[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:51.660]   and I hope it's a profoundly fulfilling experience
[02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:54.060]   as opposed to one that leads to my demise.
[02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:55.660]   But-- - You have a will, right?
[02:51:55.660 --> 02:51:57.580]   (laughing)
[02:51:57.580 --> 02:51:59.220]   It all goes to the hedgehog.
[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:01.660]   - Yeah, exactly, to the hedgehog.
[02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:02.960]   Now it all makes sense.
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:06.900]   Andrew, like we talked about offline on this podcast,
[02:52:06.900 --> 02:52:09.620]   I do hope we write some stuff together,
[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:10.780]   do some research together.
[02:52:11.460 --> 02:52:14.700]   You're one of the most inspiring scientists
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:17.980]   speaking and communicating to the world.
[02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:22.420]   So I can't wait to see what you do with the podcast.
[02:52:22.420 --> 02:52:23.620]   I'm already a huge fan.
[02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:25.460]   I've been telling everybody about it.
[02:52:25.460 --> 02:52:30.020]   I can't wait to see you talk to Joe as well soon.
[02:52:30.020 --> 02:52:32.620]   And I can't wait to see what kind of paper
[02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:33.460]   we write together.
[02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:34.860]   Thanks so much for talking to me.
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:37.060]   - Thank you, that project's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:37.900]   Can't wait.
[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:39.020]   And thanks again for having me on.
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:40.220]   Appreciate you, brother.

[02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:09.180]   "We should not only use the brains we have,
[02:53:09.180 --> 02:53:11.900]   "but all that we can borrow."
