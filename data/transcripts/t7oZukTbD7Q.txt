[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I should like to call your attention this evening to three of the verses that we read just now
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   in the 14th chapter of Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and they're verses 23, 24, and 25.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   and all speak with tongues,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   will they not say that he are mad?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   he is convinced of all, he is judged of all,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   And so, falling down on his face, he will worship God,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   and report that God is in you, or among you, of a truth."
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'm sure that every preacher in this congregation will agree with me when I say
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   that this is in many senses one of the most difficult chapters in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And that is because it is the chapter in which the great apostle
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   deals with the difficult and vexed problem or question
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   of what is known as speaking in tongues or speaking with tongues.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But I don't propose this evening to preach on the subject of speaking with tongues.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'm going to attempt to do something which I think you'll agree with me when I've finished
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   is much more important.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And that is to consider with you the way in which the great apostle handled the problem.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's always interesting with this man in particular
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   to notice not only his solutions to problems, but the way in which he arrives at them.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I think that's important because so many of our troubles and problems
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   in our personal lives and in our churches at the present time
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   arise from the fact that we don't seem to know how to face our problems,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   how to approach them, and therefore we of necessity go wrong with respect to them.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Now here you notice what the great apostle does is this.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He takes this particular problem, but instead of concentrating solely on the problem,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   he lifts it up and puts it into the context of the life of the whole church.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And thereby he leads us to the great secret of his method
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   of facing and dealing with every kind of problem.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Most of our troubles arise from the fact that we have an inadequate or imperfect conception
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   as to the nature of the Christian church.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Now this comes out particularly clearly in this first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It's one of his longest epistles, and you can describe it, if you like, as a kind of omnibus epistle.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Because in this epistle, the apostle takes up a number of questions and of problems
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   which had arisen in the church and which were producing havoc in the life of the church.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And he deals with them one by one.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He didn't write this letter because he enjoyed writing.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   It's quite wrong to think of the apostle Paul as a literary man who liked sitting down and writing.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Never think of him as a man seated in a study and who just was a kind of literary person
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   who enjoyed this art of writing.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Nothing of the sort. He was a preacher, an evangelist, a teacher, traveller.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And when he writes, there's generally some good reason for it.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And here he tells us in the first chapter that he had received messages from those who were of the household of Chloe
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   telling him about these troubles in the church.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so he takes up his pen in order to write to them, to help them, to solve these problems.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And what fascinates me always is in this long epistle that he deals with every single problem in exactly the same way.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And it's always this question of the church.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Let me very hurriedly show you what I mean.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   In the first chapter he takes up almost at once one of the things that was dividing the church at Corinth.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   What was that?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Well, he says, "Now this I say, that every one of you says, 'I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.'"
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   These foolish Corinthians were dividing up over persons and personalities, if you like, over their favourite preachers.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And they were quarrelling over this.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And the church was divided into factions and into warring groups.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   How does Paul deal with that?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Well, you notice he doesn't draw up a list of his own virtues and defects and then do the same with Apollos and then with Cephas
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   and set them before them and say, "Now look, here are the facts."
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Nothing of the sort.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   He ridicules this, and he does it in this way.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   He says, "You have no conception as to what a church is.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Is Christ divided?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Was Paul crucified for you?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Or were he baptised in the name of Paul?"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He says, "You're behaving like a secular society.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The world does that.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It has its great leaders, its great men, and they form parties around them."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   But he says, "You are a church, and you're showing quite clearly in this matter that you haven't a true understanding of the nature of the church."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And so he solves that problem.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Now let me hurry on to another one.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   In chapter 5, he takes up another terrible problem.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   There was a man in the church of Corinth tolerated in the membership who was guilty of a very foul sin.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He says, "It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   that one should have his father's wife."
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Now this brilliant church was tolerating this sort of man in the membership.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   No discipline.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And what does Paul say about this?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   This terrible perversion that this man was guilty of?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "Well, unlike so many today, the apostle doesn't wallow in all the details of this filth.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   He doesn't write them a treatise on pornography or on permissiveness.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Today people seem to delight in wallowing in all these details and talking about it.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Paul doesn't do that sort of thing.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   How does he deal with this question?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   In exactly the same way as the first one.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   It's all there in verse 6.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   He says, "Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth a whole lump?"
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   He says, "You are tolerating this man in the membership of your church because you don't realize what a church is."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   A church, he says, is not a mere gathering or collection of individuals.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   A church is a kind of organic unity.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It's like a lump or a mass of dough.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And you put just a speck of leaven into it,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and because of the character of the dough and the leaven,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   this little speck will pollute the entire mass.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Now he says, "Realize that a church is an organic body in this way,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   and therefore that this one man can pollute the life of the whole church.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Get rid of this man."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   See, it's the same answer.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Chapter 7, he deals with the question of the children of converted people
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   or the case of an unconverted wife of a converted husband and vice versa.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And really he deals with that in the same way.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   This curious teaching that he has, that the believing member sanctifies, covers the other,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   because of the nature of the church.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Still the same.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   The great is another very clear illustration of this.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Here was a great cause of trouble in the church at Corinth.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Should you eat meats, foods that had been offered as sacrifices in the idol temples?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Now this was dividing the church in a very grievous manner.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   These people, you see, probably most of them had been pagans.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   They were Gentiles and they were pagans,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and in paganism they worshipped their various gods and they had their temples
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   and they took their offerings and sacrifices,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and it was a law that you should never eat any meat that had been offered to an idol.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But now they'd been converted.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But you know, the fact that people are converted doesn't mean that they're identical in every respect.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And there was a division in Corinth.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   There were some people more enlightened, perhaps more intelligent, more gifted than others,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and they'd come to see that there was no harm in eating these meats because an idol doesn't exist.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   He's the figment of people's imaginations.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So whether you take the meat there or not, it doesn't make any difference.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And they were enlightened and they were now eating the meats that had been offered to idols.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   But there were other members in the church at Corinth, equally converted, equally born again,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   but they couldn't see this.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And to them this was still an offence.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   They were bound by their old traditions.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Truly converted but traditionalists.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They couldn't see through.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   They were not working things out fully.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And this had caused great confusion and division in the church.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   When these weaker brethren, as they're called, saw the others eating these meats,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   they were grievously hurt and offended.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   But the others said, "But this is nonsense.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   There's nothing in this and we have the perfect right to do it."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And so the church was torn asunder.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   How does Paul deal with that?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Well, again, you see, he has the same solution.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's the nature of the church again.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   He puts it like this.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   He says, "Take heed, lest by any means this liberty of yours,"
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   he's addressing the stronger people here,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "becomes a stumbling block to them that are weak."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   He says, "Through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish for whom Christ died."
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And then he sums it up.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   "Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   He says, "Look here, you're brethren.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   You're not a mere collection of individuals.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You're brothers.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You're members of a family.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And in a family, if there's a weaker member,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   you don't despise that weaker member.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   No, you take care for it, and you guide it, and you help it, and you guard it."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Now, he says, "You're brothers, and act as brothers."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And later he puts it, "Conscience not thine own, but of the other also."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   They were forgetting that they were a church,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and that a church is a family.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   It's a brotherhood.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   So you see, it's the same solution.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Chapters 10 and 11, he deals with the question of the communion table,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   the Lord's Supper.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And you know, they were even quarreling there.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There was a difference of opinion even there.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Some of them, you know, they used to have a common meal and a love feast,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   probably in connection with this communion service.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And the result was that some of them came to it with too much food and too much drink,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and the others hadn't got enough.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And they were dividing even at that point.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   How does the apostle deal with that?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Well, it's still the same answer.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   He says, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   For we being many are one bread and one body,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   for we are all partakers of that one bread."
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   The church, he says, is like a loaf.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's not a mere addition of particular members.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It's this organic, vital unity.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It's like a loaf of bread.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now, he says, "You're violating that,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   and you must realise anew the nature of the church."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And so we come to these three great chapters, 12, 13, and 14,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   in which he takes up perhaps what was the greatest problem of all,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   namely the problem of these spiritual gifts.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren," and he takes it up.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Now, this was tragic.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Here, you see, was a very brilliant church,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   filled with the Spirit, great outpouring of the Spirit in the early church.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And this church was a particularly brilliant one, second to none,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   as he's told them in the first chapter in their gifts and endowments.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   But instead of using all that to the glory of God,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   it had become a cause of trouble and of confusion amongst them,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and it had led to terrible division.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   How? Well, in this way.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   All gifts are not equal.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Some gifts are more spectacular than others.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And the men with the more spectacular gifts
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   were despising the people with the lesser gifts.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And the people with the lesser gifts were jealous and envious
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   of the people with the greater gifts.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And so this church was in a state of terrible trouble,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   a state of schism, as he describes it,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   over these very gifts that the Spirit of God had given them.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Why?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Again, because they'd not understood the doctrine of the church.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They regarded these gifts as something personal and individual,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and they were making a display and a show of them,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and despising the others, as I say.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And the apostle ridicules their whole position.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He says, "You don't realize what a church is."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   What's a church?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Well, he says, "A church is like a body."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   It's in verse 27 of chapter 12.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   But listen to him bringing out this tremendous sarcasm of his.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And I think we need a great dose of sarcasm in the Christian church today
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   to ridicule a lot of the nonsense that is prevalent amongst us.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Listen to Paul ridiculing this position in Corinth.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   He says, "The body is not one member, but many.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   If the foot shall say, 'Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body,'
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   is it therefore not of the body?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And if the ear shall say, 'Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body,'
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   is it therefore not of the body?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?"
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Now, says Paul, realize the body is not a collection of fingers and hands
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and various parts stuck together.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   No, no, it's an organic unity.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It's one, and every part is necessary.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And the gifts are given to the body, and they're all to be used,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   whether great or small, spectacular or ordinary, doesn't matter.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They are all to be used to the glory of the head, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   So you see, he deals with all these problems in exactly the same way.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   All the troubles were due to a failure to realize the nature of the Christian church.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And my dear friends, it is my increasing conviction
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   that this is our greatest trouble today.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   The real problem today is the doctrine of the nature of the church.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   This is where we've gone wrong,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and all our troubles are the result of this initial and central failure.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And so, you see, in this 14th chapter,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   when he does deal a little bit more extensively
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   with the particular question of speaking in tongues,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   he again reverts to his favorite method.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   He lifts it up, and he puts it into the context of the church.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   He says, "You know, here you are, you meet together,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and you all speak in tongues at the same time,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   and you're proud of yourselves, you think you're doing wonderfully.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   But," he says, "you've forgotten what is the primary function of the church.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   What is that? It is to evangelize unbelievers."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   So he paints his picture.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   He says, "If, therefore, the whole church be come together into one place,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and all speak with tongues,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   will they not say that you are mad?
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   And so, falling down on his face, he will worship God,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and report that God is among you, of a truth."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   "Now look here," says Paul, "you've got a totally wrong conception of the church.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   You meet together in your church, and you're just interested in yourselves and in your gifts.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   You've forgotten that a man from the street, from the outside,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   may come in and sit at the back and listen to what you're doing.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   You know," says Paul, "your responsibility is tremendous.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   What's that man going to say when he goes out? That's the test.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   What's going to be his response and his reaction to what he hears among you?"
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   He says, "There are two great possibilities.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   He may go out saying that you're all mad, and never go near you again.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Or he may go out and report that God is among you of a truth."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And I feel, my dear friends, that we need to remember this at this present time.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   We need to ask again the question, "What is a Christian church?"
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Now let's look at the Apostle's picture.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   "Here you are," he says, "you've come together, and you're going to have a meeting.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It doesn't matter what form, preaching, prayer meeting, experience meeting, doesn't matter.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   You're met together in one place."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And there, he says, "as you're carrying on your meeting, a man happens to pass by."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Who is he? Well, he says he's unlearned. He's an unbeliever.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   When he says he's unlearned, he doesn't mean in a secular sense.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   He means in a spiritual sense.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   He's a man who's not a Christian. He's an unbeliever.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   He's a man who's ignorant of spiritual truth.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But he happens to pass by. He may hear the singing.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   And he may say, "I wonder what happens in there."
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   So he decides to come in out of pure curiosity.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And he sits at the back, and he begins to listen.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   "What's he going to make of it?" says Paul.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   "That man's putting you under judgment.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   This man is testing whether you're truly a church or not.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Or it may be this. You're met together in this way,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and a man passes by, and he hears the singing, and he decides to go in.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Well, because he's in great trouble.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It may be a Sunday, and he may have got drunk on Saturday night.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   He may have done something worse.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And he's woke up on Sunday morning, and he's unhappy.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   His conscience is attacking him, and he's full of the agonies of remorse.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   He kicks himself metaphorically. He doesn't know what to do with himself.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   He can't find peace nor rest.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He suddenly says, "I wonder whether these people can help me.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   They call themselves Christian."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   So he turns in, and he sits down and listens. He wants something.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   "What's he going to say when he goes out?"
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   "Or it may be something like this.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   You're met together, and a man passes by, hears the music,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and he decides to go in. Why?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, he and his wife have only had the gift and the blessing of one child.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And one and only child is desperately ill, in fact is dying.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The doctors have told them they can do no more.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And the poor man is beside himself. This child is the apple of his eye.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And he's nearly going mad, and he says, "I can't keep still.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I must go out and have some relief."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   He doesn't know where he's going. He's just walking aimlessly
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   to try and find some peace. He can't sit still.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He passes by. He hears the music. In he comes.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   He wants peace. He wants an answer. He wants some help.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   "What's he going to say when he goes out?"
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Now then, here is the great question, you see.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   These people coming in, in this way, these unlearned and unbelievers,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   they're raising the question as to what is the Church?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   What makes a Church a Church?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And I feel we need to face this question most urgently.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   What is a Christian Church?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Well, you know, there is no doubt that to large numbers of people today,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   a Church is nothing but some kind of club or institute or society.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Their notion of a club is that it's a place where
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   certain nice, decent, moral people meet,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and they have fellowship together.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Tea parties occasionally, put on a drama now and again,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   a film, and go on outings now and again,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   and have a building that they're very fond of,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and they take up collections, and that's it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Just nice people meeting together to have a talk and a bit of fellowship.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   That's many people's ideas as to what constitutes a Christian Church.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   No difference between their concept and that of a club or an institute or a society.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And then, as you know, there are others who think of a Christian Church merely as a building.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And when they talk about a Church,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   they really think of a building with stained-glass windows,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   dim religious light, and so on.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   That's their idea of a Church.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Others seem to think of a Church as a place you go to as a part of the social round.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Probably hundreds of them did it this morning.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   They go to Church every Sunday morning.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Why do they do it?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Well, because it's the thing to do in their circles,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and they go straight from the church service to a drink sherry together or something else.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a thing to do.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Look at the court circular, and you'll see it every week.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   This is a part of the social round.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Go to Church.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Nothing more than that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Not interested in truth in any respect, but it's a part of the thing to do.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And then there are others, you know, who think that the Christian Church
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   is just a society or a gathering of people who are very interested in political and social problems.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   They say that's the idea they get from the television and the wireless and the newspapers
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   that a Church is a place where people meet together to make a protest.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   They're always protesting against the war in Vietnam and against bombs and against apartheid in South Africa.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   That's the Church to them.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   They say this must be it.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   This is what the leaders are always talking about, always protesting,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   giving their political and social views.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   So the Church, they say, is a gathering of people who hold these views in common,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and they meet together to encourage one another and to send resolutions up to the government.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   You see, I read the reports of the annual conferences and gatherings of the great denominations,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   and that's what they seem to spend their time at,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   telling the prime ministers and presidents of the different countries what they ought to be doing.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   They seem to be authorities on political and social matters.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   That's their idea of the Church.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Well, I mustn't wear you.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   You see these many, many ideas that people have as to what constitutes a Christian Church.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   So isn't it time we face this question?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   What is a Church?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And the great apostle gives us the answer here.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   A Church is a gathering of people.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   You've all come together into one place.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Good people, nice people I trust, moral people, so on.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   All that perfectly true.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But that doesn't make a Church.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   The world can repeat that and counterfeit it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   What is the peculiar thing, the differentia, if you like, of the Christian Church?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And you know, my friends, there's only one answer to this question.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   God is among you, of a truth.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   That's the thing that makes a Church a Church.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   The devil can counterfeit everything but this.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   He can produce clubs and societies and institutes and gatherings of nice people.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   But there is one thing the devil can never do.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   He can never guarantee the presence of the living God.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And yet, says Paul, this is the thing that matters.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Will the men who come amongst you go out reporting that God is among you, of a truth?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now then, how do we know this?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Here to me is the great question.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   How do we know that God is among us, of a truth?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Are we concerned about this?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Is this our main concern?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Is this the thing that is uppermost in our minds when we go to our chapels and churches on Sunday?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   The realization of the presence of God.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Do we feel that unless we've known this, that we've really failed and have missed the greatest thing of all?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   So I ask the question, how do we know that God is among us, of a truth?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The apostle tells us here that even an unlearned man, an unbeliever can tell and go out and report it.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Can we do so? How do we know it?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   How do we know the presence of God?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I'm going to confine myself to the answers that are suggested in this very context.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   The first proof always of the presence of God is life and power and energy and vigor.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Wherever God is, there is life.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   God is the author of all being.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   God is the creator of the whole universe.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   God said that there be light and there was light.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Power.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   He sustains it all by the word of his power.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I've been looking at it and admiring it in this beautiful valley today.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   The power of God.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   It manifests itself in the heavens above and in the brooks and the streams and the rivers and the valleys and the hills.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   The glory of the flowers.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   God.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   There's life.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   There's energy.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   There's power.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   There's vigor.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And wherever God is, you always have this.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   The apostle has reminded these Corinthians earlier on.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   The kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Power.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Where God is, there's life.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   There's power.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   There's vigor.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So this is our first test and must be of necessity.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And you see how important it is at the present time.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Go and ask some of these unbelievers and unlearned people out in the world why they no longer attend a place of worship.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And I'm afraid the answer you'll get far too often is this.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I've been told it many times.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I've asked this question to certain men and they've said, "Yes, I've been to.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I went to a church the other day."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Well, I say, "How did you get on?"
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   He said, "Absolutely dead.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   There wasn't a spark of life among them.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Dead, dull, boring.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   I can't stand it," says the man.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   "I want something living.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I want life."
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Those people, he says, they're formalists.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   They're traditionalists.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   They don't know what they believe, if they believe anything at all.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   They're doing it out of sheer habit and custom.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   There wasn't a spark of life among them.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Absolutely dead.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   They seem to go there, he said, and keep their eye on the clock, wanting to go home.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Nothing in it.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And isn't this far too true, my dear friends?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Let me put it to you in the form of a picture.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Compare a sample of men and women who belong to the world with a corresponding sample of church members today.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Have a look at them.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Look at the people of the world first.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Saturday afternoon.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Hurried lunch.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Suddenly I see them going down the street, not only walking quickly but half running.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Where are they going to?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Football match.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And they want to be there before it starts.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   They must never be late at a football match.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   They can't miss a second of it.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And they want the best seat.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   And there they sit and the match begins.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And they begin to shuffle in their seats.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And they begin to shout.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And they shout more and more.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   They stand on their feet.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They don't know that they're doing it.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   They're lifted up.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   They're excited.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Marvellous.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   There was only one thing wrong with the football match.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It ended so quickly.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Then watch them as they go home.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   They're all talking at the same time.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Wasn't this move marvellous?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Says the man, ah, but I'll know the other one.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   That's the one I like.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And there they're all.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   They're full of it.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   They've had a great experience.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   They've had a tremendous time.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And they're full of it.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And they're wild with enthusiasm.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   That's it, isn't it?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Take a corresponding sample of church members Sunday morning comments.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Well, you know, they say a man must have some rest sometime after all.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   They didn't say that on Saturday.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   But on Sunday morning, oh, you must have sleep and rest.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And they're doubtful whether they'll go at all.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   But they're not of a sense of duty.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Or they may have given a promise to a saintly father or mother.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   They decide they'll go.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Are they half running?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   No, leisurely.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   They don't worry about being late.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Sit at the back, as far back as possible.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Then watch them during the service.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Is there any excitement?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Are they moved?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Are they gripped?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Are they?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Well, look at them.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   The man of the world says they're dead.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And then do they complain that it's too short?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Watch them as they go home.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Do they give the impression they've been doing the greatest thing a body of people can ever do?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   That they've met with the living God?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   That they've had transactions with eternity?
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Are they thrilled and moved?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   What's the impression they give?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   My dear Christian people, I can tell you why the masses are outside the church today.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   It's because of the condition of those of us who are in the church.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   The man of the world says, "I want life. I want reality."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And he says, "Those people have got nothing but a dead tradition."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And he doesn't want it.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I don't blame him.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And there is no hope to see the masses evangelized until the church is reformed and revived.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   You can have your campaigns.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   You can try and work up something.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   It'll come to nothing.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   The obstacle to men and women coming to the church is what they find in the church.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Dead bodies, mere societies, aggregates of individuals,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   knowing nothing about the power and the life of the living God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Where God is, there is life.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Shall I bring this point home by telling you a story within my own experience?
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I knew a lady, a Christian lady, who died a very wonderful death some 25 years ago in South Wales.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   But she hadn't always been a Christian.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   In fact, she was what is called a spiritualist or a spiritist.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And she was no ordinary spiritist.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   She was a medium, a very able woman.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And because of this ability that she had, she used to go from Port Talbot to Cardiff every Sunday night to act as a medium.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And she was paid a fee of three guineas for doing so, which wasn't a small fee in the early hungry 30s of this century.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Well, there she was.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   She was a medium.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   But one Sunday, she didn't feel well.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   She didn't feel well enough to go to Cardiff.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   So she was sitting in her house, and she gradually became aware of people passing by on their way to a nearby chapel.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And she began to wonder what they did there.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And her curiosity eventually got the better of her.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   She washed and changed, and she went to the chapel.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And she became a great Christian, not that night but soon after.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   And I remember asking her about a year later, I said, "Tell me, what did you feel the first time you came into the chapel?"
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   "Oh, it's quite simple," she said.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I sat down amongst the people.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And you know, she said, even before the preacher came into the pulpit, I was conscious of a power.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   She said, "You know, it was the same sort of power that I'd been used to in our meetings, but there was one difference.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I had a feeling that this was a clean power, and it made me feel that the other was unclean."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Now, here is a woman, you see, who's ignorant and unlearned, knows nothing about Christianity at all.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   She just goes into a building and sits down.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   She says, "I'm conscious of a power, an unseen power, yes, a spiritual power."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   She says, "The same sort of power that I was accustomed to in our meetings."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   There is power in spiritist meetings.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   That's why people go to them.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   There is power in the meetings of the spiritualists.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   But it's evil power, the power of evil spirits.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And she was able to differentiate.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   This unlearned woman could tell the difference between an evil spirit and the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But the point I'm emphasizing is this, that she was aware of power, an unseen spiritual power.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   This is what makes a church a church.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And as you read the history of the church throughout the centuries, this is what comes out so prominently.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   You get it in the lives of individuals.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   You get it in the histories of revivals.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   I think at random of an instance in the life of the great George Whitefield,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   great preacher of 200 years ago, friend of the Wesley brothers.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   He writes in his journal about preaching in Cheltenham one day.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And he'd been preaching and traveling very extensively, and he was weary and tired.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   And he says, "I was struggling and having a hard time."
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And then he said, "God suddenly came down amongst us."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   How did he know that?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Oh, I can tell you. He was conscious of it in his body.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   His body was electrified.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   He was charged with an energy divine.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   His mind cleared, his throat cleared, everything cleared.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   He spoke with authority.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And he said, "I could see the people with tears streaming down their faces.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Some literally fell to the ground.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Some were crying in an agony of conviction.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Others were praising God for their forgiveness."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   What had happened?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Oh, God had come down, the power of God.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And my dear friends, haven't you read the story of early Methodism?
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   This is what makes a church a church, the presence of the living God.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   John Wesley, if you read his journal for January the 1st, 1739,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   will tell you how he and Whitefield and others had met together in a prayer meeting,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   and they found themselves all with their faces on the floor.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   God had come down amongst them.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And this is what happens in revival.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   God visits his people.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   His presence is known.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And there they are, literally falling to the ground, as Paul says here.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   This is the power of God.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   And this is what makes a church a church.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   A church is not just a society, a gathering of nice, moral people.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   No, no, the world can do all that.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Humanists can do it and various other institutions.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   It is the presence of the living God, the power, the life, the energy.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   But we mustn't stop at that because the apostle doesn't stop at that.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I start with that. That's essential.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   And face to face with that test, the church at Corinth came out very well.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Nobody ever went out of the church at Corinth saying they were all dead.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Nobody ever went out from that church saying they're all mad.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   There was no shortage of life in Corinth, whatever else was wrong with them.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   So the apostle has to bring in a second test.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   What's the second test?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Discipline, order.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And he makes a great thing of this, as you must have noticed from the reading.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   He says here that all these things must be done in a way defined.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Let all things be done decently and in order.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Now this was the great problem in Corinth, wasn't it?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   As I say, there was no shortage of life.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   They were not dead.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   When the church is dead, in a sense, there are no great spiritual problems.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   There are economic and financial problems, and they spend most of their time talking about them.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   But that's not a church.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   When there's a living church, there are problems.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   You see, if you've just got a husband and wife and no children, there's not much problem of discipline.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   But if you've got a house full of children, you'll have a great problem of discipline.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Whenever you've got life, you've got energy, you've got expression, and you need control, you need discipline, and you need order.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And so was the case in this church at Corinth.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And the apostle has to tell them, therefore, that it is a characteristic of the church that there should be order.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And isn't this one of the most amazing things about our great and glorious God?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Think of his power.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   As I say here, just as he said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Think of the energy, the power in every atom in these flowers.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Think of the power that's underneath the ground in this valley.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   The power of God.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It's illimitable. It's absolute.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   But this is the amazing thing.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   The power of God is always a controlled power.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It is an ordered power.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   That's why you get design and order and arrangement.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And that's why you get the laws of nature.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Great power, but ordered and disciplined.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And this is the characteristic of God always in every realm, in the spiritual as well as in the other.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   You know, we can say about God and his actions what we say about fire.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   We say, don't we, "Fire is a good servant, but a bad master."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   You've got fire. What a wonderful thing it is.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Boil your kettle, heat your home, drive your steam engine.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Fire is a good servant, but you let fire get into control and you'll have nothing but havoc and wreckage.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Well, now then, it's exactly the same, says the apostle here.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   You've got life, you have energy, you have power.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Yes, but you've got disorder.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   There's confusion. There is havoc.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   You need to be disciplined.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   But people say, "No, I can't help myself. I've been told this by men."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   You know, I've known men who've been dissatisfied with the church.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And they say, "There's no life. We must have life."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Then they've tried to produce life.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   They clap their hands, they shout, they repeat hymns and so on.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   They're trying to produce life.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And I remember a man saying to me once, who was a bit of a nuisance in the service,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I said to him, "But look here, my dear friend, you should have controlled yourself for the sake of the service."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   He said, "I can't help it. I'm filled with the spirit."
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   But I said, "You know, you don't agree with the apostle Paul.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Paul says the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Let everything be done decently and in order."
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And he gives them the instructions how to order themselves.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   You see how important this is in the life of the church?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Here is this poor man who comes in, you see, who makes this so important.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Here is this man who comes in unhappy about his life and about himself.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   He wants peace of conscience and of mind and of heart.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   And he comes into your church.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   And there he finds that you're all dead and lifeless.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   Or he finds that you're all quarrelling with one another,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   and all jealous and envious of one another, and vying with one another.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   And the man goes out still more desperate.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   He says, "I wanted peace, but they haven't got it."
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Or think of this poor man whose little child is dying.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   He wants comfort. He wants quiet.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   He wants some solace. He wants some answer.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   But even if he finds amongst you nothing but disorder and show and display, says Paul, and confusion,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   the man will go out. He'll say, "I can't stand it.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I thought they were the people who followed the Prince of Peace they talked about, but they haven't got it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   They're all at one another's throats. They're against one another.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Oh, I can't stand it." And out he rushes and says, "I'll never go near such a place again."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   So you see, we must not only emphasize the life and the energy and the power,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   but also the discipline and the order.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And that brings me to the third thing, the last thing the apostle mentions.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   What is that? Well, it's what he calls edification, knowledge, instruction.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   He's been emphasizing this from the beginning of the chapter.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   He says, "He that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   For no man understandeth him, albeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort."
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And he goes on repeating this.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   He says, "I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than ye all.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Yet in the church I'd rather speak five words with my understanding,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Brethren, be not children in understanding, albeit in malice.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Be ye children, but in understanding. Be men."
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Now this today is surely all important once more.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Understanding.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This is what the world needs above everything else.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   It's due to ignorance. It's a lack of understanding.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Why are men and women giving themselves to drink and drugs
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   and all the dissolute way of living that we are hearing about so much at the present time?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   It's because they're ignorant of the living God and the judgment to come.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Why the confusion between classes, industrial and in every other respect?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   It's all due to the fact that men and women don't think.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   It's a lack of understanding. It's a lack of knowledge.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   All the troubles of the world are due to a lack of understanding.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And the church is here to give understanding.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   My dear friends, we need to come back to this.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I'm told repeatedly by ministers at the present time that people no longer want preaching.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   They say they don't want a sermon that lasts more than a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   They say, "We can't take it. We can't stand it."
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   They want more music. They want more entertainment.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   They want some display. They don't want teaching.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   They don't want preaching.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   It's a denial of the gospel.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   The church is in the world to teach.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   The blessed Lord himself said, "I am the light of the world.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And he said, "You are the light of the world, and this is what we are for."
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Paul says to the Philippians that we are like lights or luminaries in the heavens, holding forth the word of life.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   If we don't teach men and women today, who can teach them?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Can the politicians teach them about how to live and about their souls and their eternal destiny?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Can the philosophers? Can the scientists? Can anybody?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   No, no. We are the sole custodians and guardians of the mysteries of God.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   The church has the only knowledge that the world needs tonight, and it is our business to give it.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And if men and women won't listen, well, I say we still go on preaching to them.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And when things have gone from bad to worse, they will come back and they'll listen.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   They have no light. They have no knowledge. They don't know where they're going.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Everything is drifting. The world is in a state of confusion.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   So is the church. What do we need? More entertainment? Certainly not.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   More singing? No, no. More thinking. More preaching. More knowledge. More instruction. More teaching.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Knowledge. Let all things be done unto edifying.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   This is the primary task of the Christian church, to bring men and women face to face with a knowledge of the truth, as it is in Christ Jesus.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   Very well. Those, according to the great apostle, are the great tests of the presence of the living God, where God is.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Oh, there's life and energy and power. You feel the touch of his power.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Haven't we known it? Of course we have.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   This is what makes a man a Christian, a man who's never felt the touch of the power of God.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   He may have intellectual apprehension and may accept intellectually certain propositions.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   It doesn't make a man a Christian. A Christian is a man who, if I may borrow the words of Wordsworth, can say,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   I have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   He's known the Creator dealing with him, smashing him and remaking him, the touch of the power of God. Of course.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And he also knows something about the discipline.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   And he's got the knowledge and the light and the instruction that is enshrined in this book.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   But very well. The final way of putting it is this.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   It's this stranger who comes in, who really tests whether we're a church or not.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   How does he do it? Well, he says, says the apostle, he does it like this.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   If all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned, if you're a true judge, what happens?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   He is convinced of all. He is judged of all. What does this mean?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Well, there he is, poor fellow. He's come in and he's sitting at the back and he listens.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And at first he begins to wonder what's happening. He's never heard anything like this before.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   And he says, I don't know. I can't make a head nor tail of this. I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   And he's on the verge of picking up his hat and going out. But he can't. Somehow he feels there's a presence there.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   There's a power. He feels something there that he's never felt in a bingo hall or in a cinema or in a public house or anywhere else.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   He's conscious of some strange power. So he goes on listening, not understanding a thing.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   And as he goes on listening, he begins to feel that he's a very ignorant man.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Of course, he was a man of the world and he knew a thing or two.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   He read the Sunday newspapers and all these special articles of these great men.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And he listens to the great lectures on the television and the wireless.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Oh, he knows he's a politician too. And he has his opinions.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   But now he hears these people talking about a soul. And he didn't know that he had a soul.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   He hears these people talking about God. He's never thought about God.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   He hears some of them testifying to marvellous answers they've had to prayer. He's never prayed in his life.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And he begins to say, "Where have I been living? What am I? I'm a fool. I'm an ignoramus.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   I seem to have missed the greatest things in life."
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   He is convinced or convicted of all. He is judged of all.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   They don't turn round and point a finger at him. No, no, they're not aware that he's come in.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   They just go on talking and sharing these great things.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And as he listens, he says, "I'm a fool. I'm an ignoramus.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I don't know about the most important things in life."
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   That's the beginning. But then it goes on.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   "And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest."
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   What does this mean?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Again, does it mean that they get up and say, "You're guilty of this and that," and point a finger at him of accusation?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   No, no. Just as he's sitting there listening to them, the secrets of his heart are made manifest to him.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   He was a man of the world. He was as good as anybody else.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   He wasn't like those miserable hypocrites, those Christians.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   He paid his, well, you mustn't say 20 shillings in the pound any longer, whatever you say now.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   That's the sort of man he was, a good man, decent fellow, and he was as good as anybody else.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   But now, coming into the presence of the living God, he sees himself.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And, my friend, you'll never see yourself until you've come into the presence of God.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   You don't see yourself when you read a newspaper. They're always praising you.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   The politicians praise you. They want your votes.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Far too often the preachers today are just praising you.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   They want something from you, too.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   But that's not giving you a knowledge of yourself.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   The secrets of your heart, what gives you that?
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Oh, the presence of God.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   "It's when men and women come near to God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, they see themselves.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Saul of Tarsus with his law, proud, self-satisfied men, one glimpse of the blessed Lord of glory.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And there he is lying on his back saying, 'What shall I do, Lord? What wouldst thou have me to do?'"
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   He's the chief of sinners. He's vile. He's rotten.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   The secrets of his heart are made manifest.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   And this is what happens to a man when God is present.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   It's conviction of sin.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And if there isn't conviction of sin in our gatherings, then our churches.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Well, God is, and that's the church.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   There is conviction of sin.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   And men and women can't come in and just judge and express an opinion and go out as they felt.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   They come under conviction. They may be annoyed by it.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   They may hate it and hate the preacher.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   They may hate the people. It doesn't matter.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   They've been convicted.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Conviction of sin. Secrets of their heart made manifest.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   But thank God it doesn't stop at that.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And so, falling down on his face, he will worship God.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Why? Well, he hears these people saying, perhaps it's the preacher or perhaps somebody in an experience,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   that "Though our sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow."
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   They hear this great testimony that God so loved the world.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Yes, the world as it is tonight.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   The world that sins against him and spits in his face.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   The world that rejected his dearly beloved, only begotten son and crucified him.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   God so loved the world that in spite of that, he gave his only begotten son for them.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   He delivered them up for us all.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   He made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   He hears these people saying that they had all been sinners.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   That they're not what they are because they were brought up to do this and to go to church and chapel
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   and to live a nice little decent moral life.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   No, no. They were failures. They were reprobates.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   But God has not only forgiven them, he's given them new life.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   He's regenerated them. They're born again. They're new men.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   If any man be in Christ, he's a new creature.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   All things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   It's the power of God unto salvation.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Very well, says the man, if it can do it for them, it can do it for me.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And he falls on his face. He cries out for it.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And God hears his humble cry and gives him the assurance that his sins are forgiven.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Blotted out like a thick cloud.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   He becomes a new man. He's got a new understanding.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   He can even face the illness of his child in a new way.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   He can face life in a new way, face death in a new way, face everything in a new way.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   He's a new man in Christ.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   And so he worships God.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And he goes out.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   And he meets a man and he says, have you ever been in amongst those people?
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   No, says the man, and I'm not going to. I'm not interested in them.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   They're a pack of hypocrites.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   No, no, he says, you're making a great mistake.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   I used to think like that of them. I've just been in there.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And I went in in great trouble. I'm coming out a new man.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   If you're in trouble, go there. They'll help you. They've got life.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   They're not traditionalists. They're the children of the living God.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   God is among them of a truth.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Go in and you'll meet with a living God.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And you'll be amazed at your former self as you'll be amazed at your new self in Christ Jesus.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   That's the church, my friends.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Not an institution.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Not merely preserving buildings or some old tradition and going through a form and ceremony and ritual.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   No, no.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   It's the presence of the living God.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   That always leads to conviction of sin.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Have we known it?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Do we know conviction of sin?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   It leads also to a realization of our utter vileness, hopelessness, rottenness.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And that salvation is entirely of the grace of God to be received by faith.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Justification by faith only.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Grace abounding to the chief of sinners.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   And to be filled with thanksgiving and praise and worship and rejoicing.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   And then you go out and report.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   This is the way to evangelize.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   Not advertising.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   Not working up some big meeting. No, no.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Every Christian who's had this experience, he goes out and he reports.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   He tells everybody.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   That's how Methodism spread.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   That's the early Christian church spread.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   The testimony, as I was saying yesterday afternoon, of these ordinary people,
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   they report that God is among us of a truth.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   My dear friends, let us never be satisfied in any gathering without a realization of the presence of the living God.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   Let's pray for this constantly.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Before we come, when we've come, always.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Let's make certain that God is among us.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And let's be satisfied with nothing else, nothing less,
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   than the realization of the presence, the power, the order, the light and the knowledge, the truth,
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   which come alone from the presence of the living God.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Let us pray.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   O Lord, our God, arise. The cause of truth maintain.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Have mercy upon us in this evil hour.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Great God of our fathers, have pity upon us.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Thou dost not change, thou canst not change.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Thou art the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow cast by turning.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Thou art the God of Abram and of Isaac and of Jacob.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   The God of David and the mighty prophets.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   The God of John the Baptist, the God of the apostles.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   The God of the early martyrs.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   The God of Martin Luther and John Calvin.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   The God of the early Protestant confessors and martyrs.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   The God of the Puritans and the Covenanters.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   The God of the Westleys and Whitfield, the early Methodists.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   And the early Baptists, the early Independents.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   O God of our fathers, be our God.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Hear our humble cry.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   For his name's sake, not for ours we are unworthy.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   For his name's sake, arise, scatter thine enemies, confound thine enemies.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Descend in all thine ancient power into our midst.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   And let us be known as people, amongst whom is the living God.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Remain with thy dear people here in such manifest power and glory
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   that they shall become the talk of this whole area.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   And men and women shall come in order to meet with thee, the living God.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   Lord, hear us in this our prayer and answer us according to thy known riches in glory.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   And unto thee and unto thee alone shall we give all the praise and the honor and the glory,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   both now and forever. Amen.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
