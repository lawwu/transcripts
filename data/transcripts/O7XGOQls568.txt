[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:15.000]   the Gospel according to St. John, in chapter 5, reading verses 31 to 35.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.800]   Verses 31 to 35 in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.880]   If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.200]   There is another that beareth witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesseth
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.320]   of me is true.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.000]   Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.680]   But I receive not testimony from men, but these things I say that ye might be saved.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:02.960]   He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   his light.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.080]   We come back once more to these verses which we began to consider together last Sunday
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   evening.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.880]   And let me very hurriedly remind you again of the setting and of the context.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.520]   Our Lord here is addressing these Jews, which not only did not believe in him, but who regarded
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.240]   him as one who was opposing the will of God and breaking God's holy commandment.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.760]   They thought that about our Lord because he had healed men on the Sabbath day.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.960]   And that to them was sin and inexcusable sin, and was indicative, as I say, of the fact
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.200]   as they saw it that he was opposed to and crossing the will of God.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.160]   And our Lord begins to speak to them.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.240]   And what he tells them, you remember, in essence is this, that his will and God's will are
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.360]   one, that he does nothing of himself.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   His mind is one, his purpose is one.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.120]   They see quite clearly that he's making an extraordinary claim, that he is equal to God.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.880]   And he tells them quite plainly that he is.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   He says that as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given to the Son to have life in
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   himself.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.280]   Power, this authority to exercise judgment.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   He is the Son of Man.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.280]   Now, nothing you would imagine could be plainer, clearer, more explicit than such statements.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.720]   And yet, these Jews still didn't believe in him.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.640]   And our Lord shows his anxiety for them and his desire to help them.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.760]   He still goes on speaking.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.720]   If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true, by which he means, now I have said
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.200]   certain things to you, but I know perfectly well that from your standpoint this is of
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.360]   no value because I'm saying it myself.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.680]   You say that my witness is not true.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.240]   All right, he says, there is another that beareth witness of me.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.320]   And I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.160]   And that is reference, of course, to none other than to God himself.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.400]   Later on, he puts that again quite plainly and explicitly, where he says, the Father
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.760]   himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.200]   But here he's putting it in a preliminary form.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.960]   Now he says God himself has borne witness to me that I am his Son.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.920]   How has God borne that witness?
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.160]   He says that God has done so in a number of different ways.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   He takes up the first, and here's the first.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.880]   You yourselves sent unto John, John the Baptist, and he bare witness unto the truth.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   But I receive not testimony from men, but these things I say that ye might be saved.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.040]   John was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   his life.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.400]   Very well, he says, if you don't believe my words, what about the evidence and the witness
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.200]   of John the Baptist?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:42.000]   You yourselves sent a deputation to John, asking him whether he were the Christ or not.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.320]   You'd heard about him, you'd heard about his preaching, you'd heard about this extraordinary
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.000]   character living out there in the wilderness, and you sent a deputation.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   Saying, who are you?
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.080]   Are you Elias, or are you that prophet, or are you one of the prophets?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.840]   Who are you?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.080]   Now then, John, he says, bore testimony unto the truth.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.480]   John gave his witness, and you know exactly what he says.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   Why don't you believe it?
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.480]   Now I'm taking up all this this evening, as I did last Sunday evening, and using it
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.520]   in this way.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.640]   The evidence of John the Baptist is still available.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.120]   And you notice what our Lord says about it.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   He says, I receive not testimony from men.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.080]   I'm not referring you, he says, to John the Baptist and his evidence, because I need any
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.680]   evidence from men, as it were.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.240]   I'm doing it simply to help you.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.440]   I am doing this, these things I say, that you might be saved.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.160]   If these men had believed the evidence of John the Baptist and had accepted it, they
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.200]   would have been saved.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.360]   And that is equally true tonight.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.560]   If we believe and accept the evidence of John the Baptist, his testimony to the truth, if
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.040]   we are not already saved, we can be saved.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.320]   Now we've already considered what it means to be saved.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.200]   To be saved means that we are delivered from the guilt of sin, the penalty upon the guilt,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.920]   delivered from the power of sin, delivered from the pollution of sin, delivered from
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:32.600]   God's law and its condemnation, delivered from the wrath of God.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.240]   And according to our Lord, John the Baptist said sufficient to enable us to be saved.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.400]   And that's why we are taking this trouble with his evidence.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.800]   Now last Sunday evening we saw this, that John said very plainly and very clearly, if
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.640]   you want to know, the evidence is to be found clearly in the first chapter of this gospel
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   according to St. John in verses 19 to 34, and again in the third chapter of this gospel
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.520]   in verses 25 to 36.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   You will then find it in a remarkable manner in the first seventeen verses of the third
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.000]   chapter of the gospel according to Luke.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.080]   There is the evidence of what John did say.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.280]   Now then, we are looking at it.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   What did he say?
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:24.320]   Well, he said immediately, quite plainly and clearly, "I am not the Christ."
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.440]   "Don't look at me," he says, "I'm not the Christ."
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.000]   "But there standeth one among you whom you know not."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.840]   "Here is the one," he says, "I'm not worthy to undo the latchet of your shoes."
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.680]   "Here is one who has come from heaven and is above all."
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.880]   "Here is the bridegroom that has come for his bride, the church."
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.560]   "Here, indeed," says John, "is the Son of God."
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.120]   John goes on, you remember, to say that he himself had not been clear about him, but
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.760]   the one who had sent him to baptize had said unto him, "Upon him whom you see the Holy
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   Ghost descending and abiding upon him, he is the one that will baptize with the Holy
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   Ghost."
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:23.200]   "And I bear record," says John, "that at the baptism I saw the Holy Ghost descending
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.360]   upon him in the form of a dove and abiding upon him."
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.760]   So John bore his testament to the fact that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Son of God.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.720]   But that is not the whole of his evidence, so we must continue with it.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.560]   And this is what we find.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:51.320]   John said that far from being the Messiah himself, he is merely a kind of prologue.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.600]   He is merely the man who is exercising a ministry that is going to prepare the way for the Messiah.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:05.120]   "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.880]   in the wilderness a highway for our God.'
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.320]   He is sent to exalt every valley and to bring down every mountain and hill to prepare this
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.800]   great highway for the Lord."
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:30.640]   So John goes on then to say that his ministry is merely a preparation for the Lord.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.680]   He says it is a very essential preparation, and that if men and women are really to know
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.960]   the true Messiah, the Christ that they were expecting, well then they have got to submit
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.680]   to this ministry of John.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.560]   They have got to undergo this preparation.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.800]   And it is only men who are thus prepared by this preliminary ministry who then are able
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.080]   to receive the ministry of the Christ himself.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.120]   Very well then, here is something that is very important for us.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   John's ministry, the whole of his ministry, is in itself a testimony to the Lord, is a
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.280]   witness to it, is a preparation for it.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   "Get me in the right perspective," says John in effect.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.040]   "Put me in my right place."
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.920]   He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.360]   I have been sent by God, I have got an essential ministry, and the ministry of John, my friends,
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   is as essential tonight as it has ever been.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.520]   The gospel preaching does not start with saying, "Come to Christ."
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.400]   Oh no, there is something before that.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.360]   There is a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.960]   That is the ministry of John the Baptist.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   What does this mean?
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.800]   Ah, this is the preparation.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.560]   Indeed no man will ever truly come to Christ unless he has first believed the ministry
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.880]   of John the Baptist.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.520]   It is only those who have repented who can find salvation.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   Repentance is essential.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.440]   It is always the first thing in the scripture.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.400]   The apostle Paul puts it in his way.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.720]   You remember in saying farewell to the elders of the church at Ephesus, he says, "You must
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   bear me record."
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.880]   How without ceasing, day to day and from house to house, I preached.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.720]   What did he preach?
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:35.160]   The repentance that is toward God and the faith that is toward the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.000]   And you read the book of Acts.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.760]   You will find that he and Peter and everybody started with repentance.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.120]   Listen to Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.520]   The people under the power of the Spirit cry out saying, "Men and brethren, what shall
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   we do?"
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:55.840]   And here comes back the answer of thunder, "Repent, every one of you, and be baptized
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.480]   again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   Repent.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.920]   It is always the preliminary note.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.080]   It is an essential note.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.120]   It is a vital part of the witness of John the Baptist.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:17.440]   And so it still remains this evening for every one of us.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.480]   John says, "I would have you realize who he is.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.680]   I would have you understand that this is the most momentous event that the world has ever
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.680]   known.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.520]   The King is coming.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.640]   I am merely the herald, the forerunner.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.040]   I am preparing the way.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.640]   Are you ready to receive the King?
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.880]   Are you ready to honor him?
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.600]   Are you ready to submit to him?
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.360]   I am here to prepare the road, the highway for him, and I prepare it like this."
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:52.040]   And so he preached his baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040]   What does this mean?
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:02.640]   Well, this means, as the preaching of John makes so abundantly clear, that we all of
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.200]   us have to examine ourselves.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.960]   We have to face ourselves in the light of God's holy law and his eternal demands upon
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.160]   us.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.040]   That was what John really did.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:27.400]   He reminded these people of the law and of God in his holiness and of the judgment of
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.400]   God.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.640]   And he said, "Examine yourselves."
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   He saw some of these religious Jews, the Pharisees and Sadducees and others coming along, and
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.960]   he looked at them and said, "Who hath warned you to flee from the Rastakhan, you generation
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   of vipers?"
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.600]   And then he looked at them again, he knew them so well.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.680]   He said, "Now begin not to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:14:01.560]   For I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.680]   It is no use coming into the presence of God," says John the Baptist, "and saying, 'Ah, we
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.680]   are all right.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.920]   We are the Jews.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.180]   We are the descendants of Abraham.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.600]   We are Abraham's children.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.080]   Everybody else, of course, are outside.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   They are dogs.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.080]   They are irreligious.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   But we, we are the chosen people, and therefore we are all right in spite of all our deficiencies.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.760]   Begin not to say within yourselves, 'We have Abraham to our father.'"
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:36.080]   If you think it's as mechanical as that, says John, I tell you that God could produce creatures
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.240]   like that out of these stones.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.240]   It isn't that.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:45.800]   No, no, you come before God, he says, and you realize your sinfulness.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.360]   You see God's holy law upon you and upon your life, and you bow down before him, acknowledging
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:15:00.240]   your transgression, admitting and confessing that you have sinned against him, that you
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.800]   have not lived to his glory, that you have broken his commandments, you have gone your
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   own way.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   That is repentance.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:15.400]   Repentance means that a man truly faces himself and his sin and gives up every endeavor and
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.960]   attempt to defend himself or to explain himself away.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.440]   He realizes that he has no claim upon God's love whatsoever.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   He never, therefore, grumbles nor complains.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.920]   He sees himself as such a miserable wretch that he knows he deserves nothing but hell.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.720]   He's been selfish, he's been self-centered, he's put his will before God's will, he's
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.240]   gone his own way like a sheep, he's gone astray, and there's nothing to say for it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.080]   He's done it deliberately.
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:58.120]   Now he turns back to God and he admits it and he confesses it.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:05.200]   Oh, it's all there in the parable of the prodigal son who just went home and said, "Father,
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.120]   I have sinned against heaven and before thy face, and am no more worthy to be called thy
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.360]   son."
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.200]   He admits he's forfeited everything, that he's got nothing to say for himself at all.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.960]   He comes back as a beggar and as a suppliant.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.640]   Or take our Lord's other parable.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.320]   The publican and the Pharisee went up into the temple to pray.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.960]   There's the publican, the man who goes home justified.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.160]   He can't so much as lift up his head.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.800]   He doesn't walk to the front and boast like the Pharisee.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.040]   No, no, he falls on his knees at the back.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.520]   He smites his breast.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.640]   He can't even look up but he says, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.040]   That's repentance.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:56.160]   But you remember John went on to say, "You must make a thorough work of this.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.600]   I am the herald," he says, "of the king, the Messiah, the one who's standing among you
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.360]   and whom you know not."
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.920]   This, says John, is the turning point of history.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.160]   This is the cataclysmic moment.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   Very well then, he says, "Make a thorough work of your repentance."
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.720]   You remember the graphic way in which he put that?
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:25.880]   He says, "Now, the axe is laid to the root of the tree."
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.120]   It's no longer enough, says John, just to trim and clip a little bit of the branches
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.920]   and knock off a few dead leaves.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.320]   It's not enough even to take off an occasional big branch.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.120]   The axe is laid to the root of the tree.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:48.000]   Well, now, this is just another way of saying that the coming of this person, Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.680]   is the momentous event.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   This is the turning point.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.280]   Now then, says John, nothing will do at this point but that you do a radical and a thorough
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   work.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.720]   Oh, you don't say, "Oh, well, I am a little bit sorry for certain things I've done."
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.920]   No, no, says John, get on with it, get down to it.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.080]   Don't let anybody persuade you to say, "Oh, that's all right, come to Christ as you are."
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.520]   No, no, face yourself and the plague of your own heart.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.920]   Realize how you have offended against that holy God.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:28.040]   To pass a single day without praising God and pouring out your heart in worship and
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:34.840]   in adoration is sin of the deepest dying.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.680]   Not to thank God perpetually for his treatment of us, for the health and strength and the
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:47.200]   power that he gives us, is not only base ingratitude, it is horrible sin.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   My dear friends, what makes sin sin is not simply the actions we do, it is our relationship
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.960]   to God.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   You can be a highly moral man against whom nobody can point a finger, but if you don't
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   live to the praise of God and if you don't worship him and love him and adore him with
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.920]   the whole of your being, you are a terrible sinner.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.920]   Realize that, says John the Baptist.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:18.120]   Repent, do a thorough work, examine yourselves, look at yourselves in the light of the truth
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:25.160]   of God, and then, "Thus you lay the axe to the root of the trees, and you admit you've
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.040]   got nothing at all.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.480]   This one," he says, "whom I am preparing you for is the king and he's the judge.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.560]   His fan is in his hand and he will truly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:48.280]   but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable."
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.160]   That's the message of John the Baptist.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.840]   And he says that all this is preliminary.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.080]   Now my dear friend, let me put it to you like this.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:03.520]   Are you a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, to use his own terminology?
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.400]   Can you say that he saved you?
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.800]   Do you find him to be the savior of your soul?
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:21.600]   Can you honestly say, "Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to thy bosom fly, while the nearer
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:28.080]   waters roll, while the tempest still is high."
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:35.840]   Can you say to him, "Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:43.640]   Raise the poor, cure the faint, heal the sick, lead the blind.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:51.880]   Thou of life, the fountain of life, freely let me take of thee spring, thou up within
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.360]   my heart rise to all eternity."
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   Can you say things like that?
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.760]   Is he a savior?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.280]   Do you know him or are you like these Jews whom he was addressing?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.360]   I'm asking my questions for this reason.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:16.680]   That if you can't imply such language, if you can't appropriate such poetry to yourself
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.360]   and use it as the expression of your own heart and your own experience, it means, I say,
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.840]   that you don't know him.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.720]   And probably you don't know him because you've never really seen your need of him, which
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.480]   means that you've never really repented, which means that you haven't accepted the testimony
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.600]   of John the Baptist, which means that you haven't listened to his evidence, you haven't
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.280]   come under his conviction.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.880]   The preliminary law work has not taken place.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:53.200]   Because it is only those who go to him in their helplessness and their emptiness and
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:22:01.560]   their woe, it is only to them that this blessed knowledge is given, that he is the savior,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.120]   the savior of their souls.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.360]   Very well, there is John's further bit of evidence that his ministry is merely and purely
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:15.720]   preparatory, that he's only preparing the way for him, setting the stage for him, and
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.320]   then he's going to disappear.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.840]   He must increase, I must decrease.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:29.800]   Very well, but then he goes on to say another thing, and that is that momentous thing, that
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.960]   most glorious thing, which you will find in this gospel in the first chapter and in the
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.400]   twenty-ninth verse.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.840]   It follows after what I've been saying.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:57.000]   The next day, John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith, "Behold the Lamb of God, which
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.760]   taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:15.560]   Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:20.840]   Here is the central bit of testimony that John the Baptist bore to him.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.480]   It's amazing, it's astounding.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.080]   Nothing more perfect was ever said, it's all there, and John said it, John the Baptist
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   said it.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.960]   That's why our Lord says, "I'm telling you these things in order that you may be
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   saved."
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.800]   If you'd only listened to what John said, you would be saved.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:45.120]   He said, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.840]   But the question is, what did John mean by that?
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.720]   What does it mean to us this evening?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.440]   What is this testimony?
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.840]   It surely means these things, two main things, surely.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.680]   Here is the first.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:07.840]   John by saying, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world,"
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:17.760]   is saying that the Lord Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all the Old Testament promises
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.520]   with regard to salvation.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.880]   Now that's why his phrase is such a striking one.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.840]   John was addressing Jews.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.560]   They had their Old Testament scriptures.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   They read them, they believed them to be the Word of God.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.240]   They believed that in them they could find salvation, as our Lord reminds them later
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.760]   on.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:51.040]   And John turns them to these in this very phrase, and he says, "The one of whom I'm
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.640]   seeking, the one who the lecher of whose shoes I am unworthy to unloose," who is he?
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:01.000]   He is the fulfillment of all the Old Testament promises with regard to salvation.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.640]   That is in a sense, of course, what the Old Testament is.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   Nothing is more important when we read the Old Testament as that we shouldn't miss
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.640]   the wood because of the trees.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:22.200]   And the wood is just this, the Old Testament is the unfolding of God's great promise
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.200]   of salvation.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:31.120]   It began even a way back in the Garden of Eden, where man in his folly had rebelled
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.720]   listening to Satan and had fallen and had found himself in misery and righteousness.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.000]   He's lost.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.480]   God came down into the Garden, and at once he gave the initial promise of salvation,
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.680]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.960]   That's a promise of salvation.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.880]   God has said, "The devil has come in and he's brought this loss and this ruin and
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:04.440]   this destruction, but I am going to save this world, and I'm going to save it through
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.880]   the seed of the woman, the one who was first in the transgression."
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.400]   And then you go on reading your Old Testament, and you find that God goes on renewing and
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.280]   repeating that promise.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.200]   He does so in a great variety of ways, but you know, the whole time that's what he's
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   really doing.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.520]   He did it after the flood.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.640]   He put the rainbow in the cloud.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.760]   He said, "I'll never drown the earth like that again."
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.640]   There it is once more.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.440]   But then he began to do it in a very special way when he called a man called Abram, took
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.120]   him out of the midst of paganism, called him out, and put him into the land of Canaan,
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:54.880]   and gave him a great promise, and made a covenant with him, and turned his name into Abraham.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.040]   And then he begins to give these promises much more clearly and specifically.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.520]   I mustn't go through them all tonight.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.640]   I'm just going to pick out the important ones to which John was obviously referring
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.640]   in saying, "Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   What are they?
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.980]   Well, here's one of the most vital of all, the one that I read about to you at the beginning
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.280]   out of that twelfth chapter of the book of Exodus.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.480]   Oh, what a vital scripture that is.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.120]   "Here are the children of Israel, these people whom God has made to himself out of
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   Abraham.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.840]   Alas, they are slaves down in Egypt.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.320]   They are under the heel of cruel taskmasters.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:45.080]   They are in a terrible condition of bondage, and they are groaning and complaining, and
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.400]   the taskmasters are lashing their backs with whips.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.920]   They seem to be lost.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   How can they be delivered?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.160]   They are in the hands of Pharaoh with his chariots and his hosts and his men of war,
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.480]   and they haven't a single armament between them.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.160]   How utterly helpless and hopeless is their case.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:07.720]   Ah, but you remember God brought them out, and you remember how he brought them out.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.240]   He visited the Egyptians with death and destruction.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.840]   He sent this death amongst them, but he spared his own people.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   And how did he do so?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.240]   Well, he needn't have done it, but he decided to do it in this way.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.760]   He told all the heads of the households of the children of Israel to take a lamb and
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.640]   to kill the lamb and to collect the blood in a basin, and then to take a bit of hyssop
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.800]   and dip it into the blood in the bowl, and then to paint the blood as it were on the
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.360]   lintel and on the doorpost of the door.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.320]   And every one of them did that so that when the angel of death went round, every time
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:58.000]   he saw this blood of the lamb that had been slain, he passed it by, the Passover.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.440]   But God, you remember, not only did that, he gave a commandment about it.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:09.640]   He said, "Now, as long as you live and as long as you exist, you as my people must observe
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.000]   this Passover.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   You must have a feast."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.680]   And he told them how to do it.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.480]   To remind and to commemorate, to remind themselves and to commemorate this great act of the Passover,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:26.080]   how he delivered the children of Israel and didn't destroy them, but passed them by and
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.280]   took them out and put them into their own land of Canaan.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:33.040]   Observe, he said, the Passover year by year.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.600]   Why do you think he said that?
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:40.640]   And you know, there's only one answer to that question.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.440]   What he did at the Passover was but a pale adumbration of what he was going to do for
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.320]   the world later on when he sent the Messiah.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.160]   That's just a preliminary promise, if you like.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.320]   That's just doing it on a yet bigger scale.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.480]   He's just showing them, "As I'm delivering you, thus now my people, I'm going to send
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.280]   the Messiah, the Deliverer, to deliver the sins from men in the world."
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:14.920]   The Passover lamb is a type pointing to the Christ, the Messiah, who is to come.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.720]   So that every year as it came round and they observed the feast of the Passover, they said
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.160]   to themselves, "We're not only looking back, we're looking forward.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.080]   God did that to our forefathers.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.640]   God is yet going to do it."
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.840]   And they looked for him and they waited for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.720]   But you know, he didn't stop at that.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:42.040]   A little later, God gave Moses great instructions as to how he was to be worshipped.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.880]   He told him to build and erect a tabernacle, to divide it up into compartments, and then
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.080]   to do various things.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.680]   This is the one to note.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   God appointed that every single day the priests were to take a lamb in the morning and a lamb
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.680]   in the evening, and slay the lamb, offer up that lamb, every morning, every evening, day
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.280]   after day.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   What for?
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.360]   Well, for the remission of the sins of the people.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.120]   And what John is saying when he says, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.880]   of the world," he is saying, "Here is the one who fulfills the types."
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.600]   Here you have the shadow, here is the substance.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.840]   Why did God tell them to take a lamb every morning and every evening and sacrifice the
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.640]   lamb in that way?
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.440]   It was to remind the people perpetually of the lamb that he was going to set.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:50.600]   "He's come," says John, "behold the Lamb of God."
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:58.360]   And the third thing that he indicates here is this, that this one to whom he is but the
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:11.160]   forerunner is also the one in whom all the great Old Testament prophecies have been fulfilled.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:18.800]   Who can dispute this statement, the assertion, that when John that next day stood and said,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.680]   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world," he was standing there
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.040]   with some followers and Jesus of Nazareth was approaching.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:35.800]   And John stood back and said, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   whole world."
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:43.200]   Wasn't he also thinking of Isaiah 53, which we read together?
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.880]   He was taken as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:53.240]   All that great chapter, here says John the Baptist, "to the people is the fulfillment
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   of it all."
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.320]   "Go back and read your prophets," he says.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.880]   "They're all promising this Deliverer, this Messiah that is going to come."
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.760]   "I've told you already," says John, "that I'm only the forerunner.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.720]   I'm the fulfillment of Isaiah 40, the voice of one crying in the wilderness."
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.400]   Yes, but he is the fulfillment of Isaiah 53.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.680]   This great God has come.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.280]   Do you remember, he says, how Isaiah said, "Behold your God."
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.280]   I'm saying it.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   Here he is, the Lamb of God.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:40.000]   He is the fulfillment of all these Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.520]   the Christ, the Deliverer.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.040]   Very well, then let me sum it all up by putting it like this.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   When John makes his exclamation and says, "Behold," he is saying to them, in effect,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:34:04.240]   "At last, the long-promised Messiah has arrived."
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.200]   Our fathers have been waiting throughout the centuries.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.640]   The prophets have spoken.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.920]   There's just been a silence of 400 years since Malachi, when nobody has spoken.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.160]   But at last, he has come.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:26.360]   God is doing the thing that marks the turning point of the ages, the center of the whole
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360]   of history.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.480]   Behold, the Lamb of God.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.640]   John is the last of the prophets.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.120]   He is the spear point of the prophets.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.640]   That is why our Lord said about him, "Among them that have arisen, among the sons of women,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.240]   there is no greater than John the Baptist."
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:50.400]   John is the spear point, the end of the prophetic line.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:35:00.760]   He is introducing the Christ, the Messiah, the promised one, the one for whom Israel
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.360]   had groaned and longed for so long.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.120]   He is here, says John.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   He has arrived.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:14.040]   Very well then, there I say that John, in his testimony, is declaring that the Lord
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:23.400]   Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of all the Old Testament prophecies with regard to salvation.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:32.760]   But thank God in this wonderful statement, he also tells us how the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:37.880]   does save.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:48.640]   And he puts it in this extraordinary way, "The Lamb of God that taketh away the sin
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.720]   of the world."
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.680]   How does Jesus Christ save?
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.400]   Isn't that the most important question?
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.880]   We may say to him, "Oh, you are always saying that Christ is the Savior.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   He says there himself, 'These things I say that you might be saved.'"
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.600]   The vital question is, how does Jesus Christ save?
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.160]   And you know, my friends, the vast majority of people who are interested in these things
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.960]   tonight and who are not Christians are in their muddle and confusion because they go
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.560]   wrong at that particular point.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.080]   How does Christ save?
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.160]   "Jesus, come," says John, "the Messiah has arrived."
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.640]   How is he going to save?
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.280]   Here is the answer.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:45.720]   He does not save by simply telling us that God forgives.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.920]   How do you know that, says someone?
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:54.160]   I know it like this, that the Old Testament prophets had said that abundantly and beautifully.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.560]   You have got it in the book of Psalms, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.000]   he put our transgressions from us."
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   The children of Israel did not need to be told that God was ready to forgive.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   They knew it.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.040]   Their literature proclaimed it everywhere.
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.400]   It was the great message of the prophets.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.520]   So that Jesus Christ does not save by just telling us that God is love and that he is
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.520]   prepared to forgive us.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.160]   You know, there are people who are saying that and teaching that.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.640]   It is because they have not listened to the evidence of John the Baptist.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.720]   For John the Baptist makes it quite plain that that is not how he saves.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:38.040]   Neither does he do it by exhorting us to save ourselves.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.720]   There are people who seem to think that that is it, that Jesus Christ came into the world
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   in order to teach and that he said something like this.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.960]   Now you live like that and God will forgive you.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.880]   That he came to exhort and to teach and to indicate us the way.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:01.760]   And if we follow him, therefore, the imitation of Christ, that we save ourselves.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.200]   We live a good life.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.800]   We begin to fast and to sweat and to pray and to read our Bible and to go to church
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.840]   and do good.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.120]   And if we do that, well, we make ourselves Christian.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.640]   We are doing what Christ told us to do and so we are saved.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.800]   In other words, he came to tell us how to save ourselves.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:27.640]   Can you fit that into "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world"?
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.480]   Of course you can't.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.160]   It is a blank denial of the testimony and the evidence of John the Baptist.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   Well, did he come there for merely to give us an example and a philip and a stimulus
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.920]   so that as we look at his marvelous life we say, "Now we are going after him.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.720]   We are going to imitate him.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.240]   Christ is the great pacifist of all time," or something like that, and we are going to
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.520]   follow him and thereby we save ourselves.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.680]   You can't fit that into the text.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.240]   If it were but that, John the Baptist would never have stood and uttered his tremendous
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.600]   exclamation "Behold."
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.520]   Well, what is it?
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.840]   I don't want to keep you and I needn't keep you.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:20.440]   This is something that can only be put in its utter stark simplicity and in all its
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.560]   glory and its wonder at the same time.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.120]   How does he save?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:32.280]   Well, he saves by taking away our sins.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.560]   He takes them away.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.760]   It is he that saves, not us.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.680]   He hasn't come to help us to save ourselves.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.960]   He takes our sins and he takes them away.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:49.840]   "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world."
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.720]   He bears them away.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:56.360]   How does he do it?
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.560]   The story is there in all its fullness in the pages of the four Gospels.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.920]   I'll tell you how he takes our sins away.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.560]   He first of all came into the world.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.800]   He couldn't have taken them away from heaven.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.940]   To take away the sins of men, he's got to become men.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:24.960]   So he came from heaven to earth, the incarnation.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.560]   The Lord of glory, the one who was equal with God and who didn't count it robbery to be
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:37.160]   equal with God, he took into himself human nature and was born of the womb of the Virgin
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   Mary.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   What's he doing?
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.000]   He's beginning the process of taking away the sins of the world.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.400]   You are sins and mine.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.520]   He had to become men to do it.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.680]   "Being that the children are partakers of flesh and blood," says the author of the
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.720]   epistle to the Hebrews, "he likewise himself partook of the same.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.360]   For it is not to angels that he stretches out a helping hand, but rather to the seed
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.760]   of Abraham.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.720]   So he therefore came down and took into him human nature, the miracle of the incarnation."
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.040]   That's the beginning of the process of taking away the sins of the world.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.320]   But that's only the beginning.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.000]   Let me hurry on to a second crucial step.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.120]   Do you remember how he went to John the Baptist on that occasion and asked John to baptize
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.360]   him there in the Jordan?
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.680]   And John, though he wasn't quite clear about him at that point, looked at him and said,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.640]   "Look here, I have need to be baptized of thee.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.760]   Why dost thou ask me to baptize thee?"
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.560]   And do you remember his answer to him?
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.320]   "Suffer it to be so now.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:55.480]   For thus it behoveth me to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.560]   And John baptized him there in the Jordan.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.240]   John was right in a sense.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.400]   This was a baptism for repentance.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:08.680]   This was a baptism for people who had sinned and who were therefore acknowledging their
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.720]   sin in the presence of God.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.040]   And John said, "You don't need to.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.040]   You've never sinned.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.240]   Suffer it to be so now."
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:19.840]   He said, "For thus it behoveth us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:20.840]   What's he mean?
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   What's he doing?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840]   I'll tell you.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:29.600]   Though he had never sinned himself, though he never sinned, he here identifies himself
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.360]   with our sin.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.400]   He puts himself into our position.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.480]   He's taking upon himself our sins.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.600]   He's beginning his work, strictly speaking, as the Messiah.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.640]   He's now reached the age of thirty.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.520]   He's setting out upon it.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:49.360]   And so he goes there and he identifies himself with humanity in sin.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.360]   He puts himself with us.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.800]   He goes down into the water.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.640]   He's baptized.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:01.000]   He's taken the sin upon himself.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.280]   That's another step.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:07.240]   But listen to another.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.200]   After his baptism, you remember, he was led, driven of the spirit into the wilderness to
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:19.760]   be tempted of the devil forty days and forty nights.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.520]   And there he met Satan face to face and he conquered him.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.840]   He mastered him.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   He defeated him.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.880]   Why does he do it?
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:37.320]   Ah, it's a part of the process of bearing away, taking away the sin of the world.
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.840]   Here is the one who controls that sin.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.600]   Here is the God of this world.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.520]   Here is the master of humanity.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.840]   Here is the one who makes us sin, who enticed men at the beginning and who keeps on.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.960]   And while we're in his possession, we'll never be free from sin.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.160]   He must be conquered and mastered.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.800]   Before you are sin and mine can be taken away, the devil must be defeated.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.320]   And he defeated him and went on defeating him.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.480]   Not only that, he's another thing to do.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.040]   We have all sinned, I say, against God.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.760]   We have broken God's holy law.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:20.160]   And you and I cannot be delivered from sin until we've honored God's law, until the
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:23.240]   law pronounces us as all right.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:31.880]   The law of God must be kept and honored and obeyed before any man can be just with God.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.600]   And he did it.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.720]   He lived in this world for thirty-three years.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.840]   He never broke the law.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.920]   He honored it with the whole of his being.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.360]   He rendered up the Father a perfect obedience in every single respect.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:56.760]   And in doing so, he is again doing something that bears away the sin of the world.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:09.960]   But all that, wonderful and glorious as it is, would not have been enough.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   The final step remains.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Behold, the Lamb of God.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   God's Lamb, what's he mean?
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.720]   Well, what he's saying is this.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:31.040]   He says, "Cast your minds back to that which God commanded way back there while the children
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.200]   of Israel had just come out of Egypt, while they were in the wilderness, and he told them
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.640]   about the tabernacle.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.320]   He told these priests, 'Take a lamb, morning and evening.'
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.800]   Then he said, 'Put your hands on the head of the lamb, and then slay the lamb and offer
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   him to God.'
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.720]   Why do they put their hands on the head of the lamb?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:46:01.240]   Oh, that was the sign, the symbol of transferring their sins and their guilt to the lamb that
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.520]   was to be slain in punishment for the sins.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:11.080]   The lamb is a sacrifice, so they put their sins onto the lamb first, and then they slay
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.760]   him and offer him and his blood.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:19.720]   The lamb had to be without a blemish and without a spot.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.640]   God had commanded that.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:31.920]   And you see what John the Baptist is saying here is this, "Behold, the Lamb of God, God's
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   Lamb.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.560]   Hitherto men have been providing lambs.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.800]   They've picked out a lamb a yearling, and they've found him without spot and blemish,
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   and they've put their hands upon him.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.400]   They've transferred their sins to him.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.800]   Now," says John, "these are all types and shadows.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.160]   These are all pale adumbrations of this tremendous once and for all event that is going to take
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   place.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.400]   And in this Jesus, here is God's own lamb.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.240]   God has provided a lamb.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.960]   God has chosen a lamb, and he is spotless and without blemish.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.560]   He's his own son.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.360]   He's God as well as man.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   He's perfect.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   He's never sinned.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.560]   And you know what's going to happen," says John.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:24.840]   "God himself is going to lay our sins upon the head of the lamb that he himself has provided.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:30.280]   You see, Isaiah had predicted and prophesied it all.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.400]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:43.400]   Yes," says Paul, looking back, "God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.520]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.960]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.720]   God takes your sins and mine.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.100]   He took them and put them onto the head of Christ.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.100]   He put them on him.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.680]   He imputed them to him.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.920]   And then he punished them in him.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   God's lamb.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   He smote him."
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.800]   Read Isaiah 53 when you go home again tonight and see its fulfillment in the cross on Calvary's
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   hill.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.240]   That's what's happening there.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.920]   It's God putting our sins on him.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.480]   He was bruised.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:23.680]   He was bruised for our iniquities.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.840]   All our chastisement was put upon him.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.760]   The stripes that we deserved were laid upon him.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.040]   Other iniquities were put upon him.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.080]   It's all a perfect description of the cross.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:48.880]   He is the lamb of God that beareth away, taketh away the sin of the world.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:49:02.960]   "Ah, yes," says the apostle Peter, "who his own self bare, bore our sins in his own body
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:15.080]   on the tree, that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:19.280]   are healed."
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:36.360]   "Behold," says John the Baptist, "the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world."
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:42.640]   What do you and I need to know in order to be saved?
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:49.800]   Just that, just that, that we can never save ourselves.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.400]   You can be as good as you like.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.960]   You're filthy rags in the sight of God.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.000]   You can put your back into it.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.800]   You can follow the example of all the hermits and the anchorites and the monks.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.680]   Martin Luther tried it, hopeless.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.680]   Wesley tried it.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.120]   They've all tried it.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.960]   Nothing in my hands I bring this year.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   Why?
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   Well, for this reason.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.200]   Could my zeal know respite?
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.200]   No.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.840]   Could my tears forever flow, all for sin?
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.840]   Could not at all.
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.760]   "Thou must save, and thou alone."
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.520]   And what John was telling them was simply that.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.960]   Here is God's way of saving men.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:38.080]   The Son of God has come to be the Lamb of God.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:48.520]   God will put your sins on Him and punish what you deserve as punishment in Him.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:54.400]   And then, having done so, can offer you free pardon and forgiveness.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.200]   His law has been honored.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.120]   He said He would punish sin and He can't go back on His word.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.560]   Well, in His Son He has punished it.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.560]   Your sins have been punished.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:09.200]   He has also given a perfect obedience to the law and God made Him your representative and
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.840]   therefore looks at you in Him and you are forgiven in Him.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.920]   That is what John taught.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.600]   That according to the Lord Jesus Christ is the only thing that can save us.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.800]   He said, "These things I say unto you that you might be saved."
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.520]   I'm reminding you of John's witness and testimony because he spoke the truth concerning me.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:38.640]   When he said, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world."
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.600]   My dear friend, as I leave you I ask you this question.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:50.000]   Do you know that your sins have been taken away?
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.280]   Do you believe and know that Jesus Christ has suffered your penalty?
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.800]   That God has dealt with your sins in Him?
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.960]   Do you know therefore that you are forgiven?
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.360]   Do you know that you can go to God tonight and not ask for forgiveness but thank Him
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.240]   that He has given it to you?
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.720]   That it has been given in Christ?
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.840]   Have you stopped trying to make yourself a Christian?
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.480]   Have you ceased trying to reconcile yourself with God?
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:30.120]   Do you know what to do with the devil when you go down on your knees and are trying to
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.600]   pray to God and the devil comes and says, "But look what you've done.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   Look at your past."
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.080]   Do you say, "Well, yes, I've got to admit it."
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.360]   And there you spend your time in feeling that you have no right to speak to God and that
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.520]   you have no claim.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.520]   Is that your position?
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:50.520]   Or can you turn to the devil and say, "You're right, I did sin, but Christ has died for
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520]   that sin.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   It's blotted out.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   It's gone.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:00.520]   God made Christ, the Lamb who has borne my iniquity and who has suffered the stripes
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.720]   that I richly deserve.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.840]   Get behind me, Satan.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:10.120]   I am going to God in Christ and by the blood of Christ.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:14.440]   He is the Lamb that has died for me and for my sins.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:20.720]   And though I know I am still vile and hopeless, in Him I can go to God and say, "My Father,
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:27.200]   I have come to thank Thee for the forgiveness which Thou dost give me through Thine only
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:35.240]   begotten Son, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.520]   Are you rejoicing in your salvation?
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:47.320]   If you believe in Christ, you must be, because the message is that just as you are, without
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:52.360]   any plea at all, without going out and deciding to do this or that, here and now, just as
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   you are, you just believe the message of John that Christ is the Lamb of God, and that your
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:07.520]   sins were laid upon Him and dealt with there, and that He's carried them away forever and
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.840]   has made a perfect work of it.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:21.040]   If you can say, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,"
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:29.080]   you have believed the testimony of John the Baptist, and you are saved.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:34.880]   Beloved people, if you haven't believed it until this minute, believe the testimony of
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:44.280]   John. Believe that your sin was laid upon Christ and punished once and forever, and
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:53.160]   that you can go freely to God to thank Him for the pardon and the release, and for all
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:55:03.680]   that He has made possible for you in the Son of His love, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   Amen.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   Amen.
