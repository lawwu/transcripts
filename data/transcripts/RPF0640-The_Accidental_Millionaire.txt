[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.800]   This is a 21 and over event.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.840]   knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840]   and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.920]   Today on the show, I'm going to tell you a story about a man I think of as the
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.720]   accidental millionaire.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.520]   This story comes from my background and experience working as a financial advisor.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.560]   One of the great benefits of that business is you wind up meeting with hundreds and
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   hundreds of people and talking about money with them.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.260]   And if you talk to enough people about money and you keep your ears open, you can
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260]   quickly find out what works and what doesn't work.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.120]   But every now and then, somebody will surprise you.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.200]   Usually, you get pretty good as a professional of pegging people.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.280]   You start to see a couple of clues or hear a couple of clues and pretty quickly, you
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.080]   start to put people into boxes.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.680]   But the accidental millionaire was a man who didn't particularly fit into any of my
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.960]   preconceived boxes.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.560]   I met him on a Friday.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.320]   He came into my office for a meeting and I had never known him.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   Somebody referred me to him.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.520]   I called him up, asked him if he wanted to meet with me and he said sure.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.660]   And he wound up coming into my office.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.680]   And so he came in.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   He didn't know me.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   I didn't know him.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.660]   And we went through the standard procedure, which was basically a conversation.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.200]   We would call it in the business a fact-finding interview.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.080]   And I would ask him about what his goals were for the future.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.720]   I would ask him about all of the things that he'd done, ask him about his money and his
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.600]   income, etc.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.680]   And interestingly, he didn't have a lot of specifics on his situation.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.840]   He didn't remember a lot of the numbers.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.040]   He wasn't 100% sure about how much money he made.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.120]   He wasn't 100% sure about how much money he had.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.160]   But as we start going through the numbers, they just started climbing and climbing and
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   climbing.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.180]   And by the time we got to the end of his statement of financial condition, where we calculated
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.160]   out his net worth, we both discovered that he was a millionaire and I'm pretty confident
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.080]   that he was well on his way to being a multimillionaire.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.240]   And he sat there and he looked at the paper and he kind of scratched his head and said,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.720]   "Huh, I didn't know I had that much money."
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.520]   And it struck me because very rarely do you ever find someone that looks at a paper with
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.740]   how much money they have and they say, "Huh, I didn't know I had that much money."
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.120]   And he actually didn't know that he was a millionaire.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   It wasn't something that he knew right off the bat.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.680]   He may have guessed that he was a millionaire, but he hadn't just thought about it.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   He hadn't looked at it.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   That's very unusual.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.080]   If you work with people with money, most of the time you find that the errors are in the
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.520]   other way.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.240]   People usually understate their expenses and overstate their assets.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.760]   They think they have more money than they do.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.320]   They think they spend less money than they do, but unfortunately they have less and spend
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.040]   more than they think.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.520]   It's very rare to find somebody who counts it the other way.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.940]   And I tried to figure out what was it about this man that led him to be in this situation.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.040]   Now what most stood out to me was the fact that he didn't really want to spend much time
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.860]   in my office, not because he didn't like me, but because he had other plans.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.240]   He had weekend plans and he was leaving for his hobby on the weekend, which I later found
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.680]   out was mountain biking.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   That was basically his one hobby that he really enjoyed, was mountain biking.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.200]   And it stood out to me because I thought about it and I asked him about, he was heading to
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.680]   a mountain bike tournament, and I just asked him about what he was doing and what it looked
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.600]   like and what he would do at the tournament.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   What stood out to me was how modest that hobby expense was for him.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.920]   He had I think a Toyota Matrix or some Toyota hatchback or sedan or something like that.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.280]   And he would just take his mountain bike and he would go to mountain bike tournaments.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.760]   He wasn't particularly good at it.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.080]   It wasn't like he was doing it professionally.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.120]   It was just his hobby.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.280]   But I later really thought about that and I realized what a great hobby it was.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.560]   Now I'm not sure it was the best hobby for someone who lived where we lived in South
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   Florida.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.800]   He'd have to get a good mountain bike tournament.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.940]   He had to go up to North Florida at the very least to find any hills.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.520]   But it was a very modest hobby.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   He had a bicycle and he rode it.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   And the great thing about that hobby is it didn't cost very much to get into.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.120]   It didn't cost very much to do.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.000]   And it had other benefits like keeping him in great shape.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.360]   Here's this man who's in his mid to late 50s and he's in great shape.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.600]   Well it's because he enjoyed mountain biking.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.760]   Now as I thought about the accidental millionaire and later with hindsight considered his situation,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.480]   I came to understand some of those basic things that were true in his situation that led to
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.960]   him being wealthy and on track for a very wealthy life without even paying attention.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.320]   That's my point is he didn't even pay attention and he was getting great results.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.960]   I think it's worth paying attention to things like that, us.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   Because when somebody just gets great results and they don't even have to pay attention,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.160]   they're probably doing something that would serve the rest of us well to pay attention.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.920]   So let me explain.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.160]   The first thing that he had that led to him being an accidental millionaire, a millionaire
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.640]   that didn't even know he's a millionaire, was a good income, a strong income.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.800]   In his case he was an engineer.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.280]   And he did kind of an interesting kind of engineering.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.480]   He didn't work at a big company, he worked at a small company, but he did engineering
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   work.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.920]   And engineering is one of those occupations where if you're competent with it, there's
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.040]   no reason why you shouldn't be able to earn an upper middle class income.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.540]   In his case he was earning a six figure income.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.480]   The other great thing is he'd been an engineer for a long time and he really liked the work
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.520]   of engineering.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.440]   He was well suited to engineering.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.600]   He liked the challenge of it.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.260]   He worked at a small company where he had quite a bit of autonomy and he enjoyed the
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.520]   actual work of engineering.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.120]   He didn't get involved in management, he didn't get involved, he wasn't chasing a big career.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.840]   He just liked doing his particular version of engineering.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.100]   And that strong income gave him the ability to live well without thinking about it.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.140]   The next big structural thing was that he had a structurally modest lifestyle.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.200]   He lived in an ordinary house, a reasonable house.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.500]   It wasn't particularly expensive except for the fact that it was located in South Florida,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.520]   which by definition is more expensive than other places in the country.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.140]   But it was a reasonable house.
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.940]   Just an ordinary suburban house, ordinary suburban neighborhood.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.840]   Ordinary size, everything was ordinary about it.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.080]   But it was a modest, reasonable house.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.220]   And he and his wife had lived there for a long time.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.260]   They had bought the house decades earlier.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.120]   They had gotten a mortgage.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.860]   They had just simply stayed there.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.320]   They'd raised their two daughters in that house and they continued to live in the house
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.680]   and they had no reason why they wanted to move anywhere else.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.320]   One of their other hobbies was just simply fixing up the yard.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.520]   They enjoyed gardening, working on their house, making sure that it looked nice and having
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.560]   the yard and the plants and all those things.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.460]   That was something that they enjoyed doing together.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.460]   So they had a reasonable, comfortable, normal house that they lived in.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.520]   And they had modest hobbies.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   Didn't have any particularly expensive tastes.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.720]   He had a reasonable car, but a modest car.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.880]   He had the modest hobbies of gardening with his wife and mountain biking.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.760]   He didn't have any major vices.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.760]   He didn't drink.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   He didn't gamble.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.060]   He didn't race fast cars or anything that would be expensive.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.520]   He just had a fairly ordinary approach and he had his couple hobbies that he enjoyed.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.560]   His wife wasn't into the mountain biking.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.800]   She would stay home when he would go.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.120]   He would go to the mountain bike tournaments and he would come home.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.840]   He had a modest lifestyle.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.200]   Now if you combine those things, a strong income and a modest lifestyle, then there
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   should be excess money available, which goes into investing.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.600]   In his case, that was the case.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   He didn't have a budget.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.520]   He didn't know how much money he spent, but what he did have was retirement accounts and
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.660]   he would automatically have transfers into retirement accounts and savings accounts.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.800]   And those retirement accounts weren't anything special.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.960]   They were just an ordinary 401k, but they were good enough.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.840]   He had good enough investments.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.200]   Just good ordinary mutual funds.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.720]   And he didn't touch them.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.080]   He just left them alone, which of course is the key to successful investing.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.040]   Buy good investments and don't sell them.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.240]   Very simple.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.720]   In this case, his carelessness, meaning his lack of paying attention, really serves him.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.740]   And it serves most investors who buy stocks.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.760]   If you buy good stocks, buy good mutual funds, and just simply ignore them and leave them
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.140]   alone to compound for decades, they'll compound and they'll do really well.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.420]   Probably better than if you look at them every day.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.680]   Now there were two other factors that led to his success.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.360]   The first of those two factors is he didn't have any big errors.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   He'd lived an ordinary life, a mainstream life, a decidedly non-radical life, if we're
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.000]   talking about doing weird, crazy stuff that is fun to tell stories about, but he had avoided
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   the big mistakes.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.480]   He and his wife had a successful and very long lived marriage.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.760]   He never went through divorce, never had to pay alimony, never had to pay child support,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.640]   never lost the use of their money.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.500]   So they had the benefit of their assets building together, their expenses being minimized by
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.120]   being together, and then they just continued to grow together.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.500]   He had the satisfaction that came from that long and successful marriage relationship
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.240]   that provided both of them with the emotional stability to be okay with who they were, to
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.920]   enjoy gardening together in the backyard and riding a mountain bike and not to have to
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.800]   go out and try to compensate for some emotional deficiency by spending money.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.200]   They had successful and healthy children.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.680]   Now we can't control necessarily the health of our children, but they had done a good
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.320]   job with their children, so their children weren't a financial drain on them.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.640]   They weren't worried about how to get their children off of drugs or how to bail them
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.960]   out of prison or how to figure out how to make sure they get a job.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.840]   Their children had successfully been raised and had successfully launched out on their
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.120]   own.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.320]   So he had avoided all the big errors.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.760]   He'd never faced a lawsuit, never, just had avoided all the big errors.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.340]   And then the last component was plenty of time.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.120]   He was in his mid to late 50s.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.520]   He'd had plenty of time to work.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   He'd been an engineer for decades.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.680]   He just simply set up these structural things in place, and there was plenty of time for
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.740]   investments to compound, plenty of time for income to go up, plenty of time to enjoy the
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.880]   fact that that mortgage was paid off with inflated dollars over time and then it was
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.600]   eventually eliminated and you could enjoy the time of the house and save those house
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.720]   payments instead of paying them, etc.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.760]   He had plenty of time.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:28.240]   There was nothing radical about his lifestyle except that he was radically wealthy because
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.520]   he got a few of those big rocks right.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.080]   If you're the kind of person who is well suited to this approach to life, I want you to be
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.360]   confident in your decisions.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.240]   I want you to feel confident about the fact that you don't have to do anything wacky.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.640]   I talk a lot about wacky weird stuff on this show because I enjoy it.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   My personality is not the accidental millionaire's personality.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.440]   I thrive on the craziness, on the change.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.700]   I enjoy doing the wacky weird stuff.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:11.860]   But that's not necessary for you to live a very satisfying life.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.780]   That's not necessary for you to live a rich life.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.540]   That's not necessary for you to enjoy financial freedom.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.900]   You don't have to do wacky stuff.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.220]   You just need those factors I discussed.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.860]   Think about them.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.100]   You need a strong income.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.260]   You're not going to become wealthy if you don't have a strong income.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.080]   You need a strong income.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.340]   But you don't need a million dollars a year necessarily.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.820]   You just need to be in the perhaps upper half, preferably upper quartile, top quartile of
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.960]   income earners.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.900]   This will change with inflation, but target at least six figures.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:58.460]   You can do six figures with your interests and your abilities in a job that you will
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.140]   enjoy doing.
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.500]   You can take satisfaction in doing a job.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.320]   That's the thing about that accidental millionaire.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.820]   He enjoyed the work of engineering.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:16.220]   I worry a little bit that we focus so much on the things that we don't like about work
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.980]   that we minimize just the satisfaction of doing work well.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.100]   I really appreciate craftsmen and tradesmen who just do work well.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.620]   It's satisfying to do work well.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.020]   All of us can find a type of work that we're well suited to that we get satisfaction from
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.300]   the actual doing of it, the actual work.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.040]   Sometimes this is with ideas.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.620]   Sometimes it's with things.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:47.420]   But you can find a job that will allow you to earn a strong income and do work well.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.340]   Now the great thing is if you can find a job that will allow you to work a long career
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.460]   where you're not physically beat up.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.420]   For example, the accidental millionaire wasn't particularly interested in retiring.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.460]   Why would he?
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.060]   He had a reasonable job in a low stress environment where he made good money doing work that he
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   enjoyed.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.380]   Why would he want to quit that?
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.420]   He liked riding mountain bikes and he liked gardening but he didn't want to do that 100
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420]   hours a week.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.420]   So why would he quit that?
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.220]   He had plenty of time to leave early on Friday, go to a mountain bike tournament, come back
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.620]   in and do his work on Monday.
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.380]   Why quit that?
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.460]   That's one of the most powerful wealth building tools.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.460]   Don't quit.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.300]   Don't retire at 65.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.700]   Build an income from a job that you enjoy that you can keep doing into your 70s, into
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.820]   your 80s, etc.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.000]   Build that modest lifestyle.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.740]   You don't have to live in an RV.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.020]   You don't have to live on a boat.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.340]   You can live in an ordinary house.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.300]   I'll tell you what, there's something really great about a house.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:52.140]   A comfortable house with comfortable furniture, a nice table that you can gather your family
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.540]   and friends around.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.620]   You don't have to worry about all the weird stuff that comes from living weird.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.420]   A great house really works well.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.940]   You can buy a comfortable house, make it beautiful, make it nice, make it your own and you can
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.420]   do that without spending inordinate amounts of money.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.700]   You can develop an interest in reasonable hobbies.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.860]   Hobbies that give you dual benefits like mountain biking where it gave him the benefit of enjoyment
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.260]   of something he enjoyed doing while not costing all that much money and it gave him the benefits
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.260]   of the physical exercise.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.300]   The fact that he was in great shape and he had this thing that he enjoyed doing that
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.100]   gave him a lot of joy and satisfaction and kept him in great shape.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.540]   A simple decision to pursue mountain biking instead of motorcycle riding could make a
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:43.460]   big difference in your financial situation and in the size of your belt.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.600]   Just one simple decision.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.300]   Both are fun.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.300]   Mountain biking is fun.
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.940]   I love riding a Harley.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.980]   But the Harley costs $20,000 to $30,000 out of pocket and depreciates and costs maintenance
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.060]   and care and upkeep that's often hard to do yourself.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.860]   And the Harley encourages sitting on it for hours at a time, getting no exercise, hanging
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.220]   out with lots of other fat bikers and going out and eating greasy meals as your target
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.220]   destination.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.980]   That was very different than mountain biking.
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.140]   What does a great mountain bike cost?
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.860]   A thousand, a couple thousand bucks for a really nice one?
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.580]   Buy a great mountain bike, you can much more easily do the work yourself and it lends itself
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.500]   to hanging out with an active young sort of crowd which kept the accidental millionaire
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.860]   young and kept him in great shape.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:33.100]   So choose carefully the hobbies, the lifestyle that you choose.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.500]   Make good enough investments but put those structural things in place.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.300]   Anytime somebody is really good at something, they tend to get dogged on.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.580]   I always feel bad for David Bach who wrote the book The Automatic Millionaire.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.540]   He gets dogged on for his latte factor.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.900]   Well, good for him.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.780]   He made a lot of money with that brand and I'm glad for him.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.980]   But he was right about the idea of the automatic millionaire.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.180]   If you just simply set up some basic structural things, buy some decent investments and then
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.980]   invest in them over time, you'll do fine.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.860]   You don't need to have the best investment.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.740]   It's got to be good enough and then stay invested and avoid the big errors.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:16.300]   That's why if you get those basic structural things right, a well-chosen mate, a well-chosen
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.060]   job, a good geography, etc. so you're not constantly moving across the country, you're
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.560]   not bailing your kids out of prison, those kinds of things, just avoid the big errors
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.900]   and then add time.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.220]   Add enough time for the income and the expenses and everything to work out.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.480]   Time is one of the most magical factors.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.520]   Time fixes almost any major financial problem.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.540]   If you're in debt, well, you need some time to earn income and pay off the debt.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:49.900]   Even if you make big, see air quotes in your head, big errors with money, time will fix
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.900]   those errors.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.820]   Let's say that you buy a new house and you have to go out and fill the house with furniture.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.500]   You do the classic thing of going to the furniture store and filling up the whole house with
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:07.300]   brand new furniture all purchased at 0%, no money down, monthly payments for 48 months.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:13.500]   That's something that I can't imagine any financial person would recommend to do.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:19.940]   It's a very expensive way to do it, risky way, etc. so nobody would recommend it.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.260]   But you know how you fix that error?
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.900]   You just make those monthly payments on time, pay it off in four months and then keep the
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.600]   furniture for at least a decade or two.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.020]   And the longer you keep the furniture, the lower the monthly cost of the furniture amortization
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:41.620]   schedule actually winds up being and the more reasonable of an expense it winds up being.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:47.740]   If we could predict our lives with enough certainty so that we didn't have to make big
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:54.140]   changes, the best plan would be buy a new house, spec house from a builder, but a reasonable
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:04.580]   one, fill it with new furniture, reasonable furniture and just live there for 50 years.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.460]   It works if you had time.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.700]   Now we usually don't have time and there's other points of the conversation.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.380]   But remember the story of my accidental millionaire.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:20.020]   If you get annoyed by the radical stuff or if that's not you, don't think it has to be
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.500]   you.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:30.140]   Recognize that the ordinary stuff might not make for super compelling podcasting, but
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.100]   it can make for wealthy people.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:40.140]   I can't create a podcast every day on this kind of ordinary financial plan, but you can
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.900]   live really well on this kind of ordinary financial plan.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.700]   It works and it's not a bad life.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.700]   There's nothing that has to be run away from in the story that I described.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.180]   It's not a bad life.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.740]   It's a great life.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.860]   That's the story of the accidental millionaire.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.300]   As I close, I want to invite you today to simply just come by radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.

[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:29.220]   there, one of those big ones is income and figuring out how to build a strong income

[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.140]   groaning about going into work on Monday morning.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.740]   I wrapped up my best ideas for that in a course called the radical personal finance guide
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.140]   to career and income planning.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.180]   Come on by radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and check that out.
