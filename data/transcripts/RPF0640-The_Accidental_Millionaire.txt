[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:43.420]   "The Automatic Millionaire" by David Bach, who wrote the book "The Automatic Millionaire",
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:17:13.440]   cualquier "Millionaire" is the right one. He made a lot of money with that brand and I'm glad for it. But he was right about the idea of the Automatic Millionaire. If you just simply set up some basic structural things, buy some decent investments and then invest in them over time, you'll do fine. You don't need to have the best investment. They just got to be good enough and then stay invested and avoid the big errors. That's why if you get those basic structural things right, a well-chosen date, a good deal, and you're happy with that, that's a good thing.
