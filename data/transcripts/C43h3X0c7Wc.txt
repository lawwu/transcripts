[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:15.000]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, reading from verse 45 to verse 49.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.640]   Verses 45 to 49 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.800]   "Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.760]   law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.800]   And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.520]   Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.440]   Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.960]   is no guile.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.320]   Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me?
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee when thou wast under the
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.840]   fig tree, I saw thee.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:25.080]   Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.080]   of Israel."
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.720]   Now we are continuing our series of studies in this last section of the first chapter
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.640]   of this Gospel according to St. John, the section which begins at the 35th verse.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.960]   You remember the natural division of this great chapter, the prologue, with its tremendous
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680]   statement in a sense of the whole of the Gospel.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.440]   Then the next section which contains the testimony of John the Baptist.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.800]   And here we come to this third section in which having, as it were, put before us the
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.280]   essence of the message, the evangelist now begins to give us examples and illustrations
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   of how this great message became related to individual persons.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.360]   And we are looking at it in this way.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.560]   We have spent a great deal of time in looking at that tremendous statement in the 16th verse
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.960]   of his fullness of all we received and grace upon grace.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.800]   Now that's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.920]   A Christian is a man who has received of that fullness.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   And the object of all Christian people should be to receive of that fullness and to do so
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960]   more and more.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.320]   And that is reinforced for us, of course, by the statement of John the Baptist, his
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.080]   teaching that he baptized with water, but this other one would baptize with the Holy
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   Ghost and with fire.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.720]   And we've been considering something of what that means.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   That indeed is the same thing again.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.320]   That is how this fullness comes to God's people.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   Now looking at all that, I have suggested that it may well be that many people are feeling
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.840]   somewhat discouraged.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.760]   We've been looking at great and high doctrine.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.080]   We've been venturing to look at what we may call the higher reaches of the Christian life.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.720]   And there are people who are often discouraged by that.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.560]   It demands intellectual effort.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.880]   It demands spiritual effort.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.080]   And people are sometimes, as they look at all this wondrous, glorious possibility, feel
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   who am I?
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.400]   How can I ever arise at such a state or such a position?
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:05.000]   Well thank God we are given here these illustrations and examples of how men and women, men here
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   in this particular section, of like passions with ourselves, from the most humble and unlikely
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.520]   backgrounds and beginnings, we are shown here how these men were gradually led until they
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   came to the heights.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.600]   Here's the beginning of it all.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.480]   And I'm calling attention to it, as I say, in order that none may feel discouraged, none
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.360]   may feel hopeless, because after all, the overriding message in this section is just
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.640]   this, that what really matters is his power, not our ability, not our background.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.280]   It is what he can make of us, what he can do with us.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.300]   But it's very interesting to look at these examples that are given here to us, because
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.360]   we find that no two of them are identical, and that's comforting in itself.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.480]   Any impression of the Christian life to the effect that it produces a standard type, always
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.760]   the same, is false to the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.000]   That's true of the cults.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.120]   It isn't true of Christianity.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.240]   So we look at these different men with their different backgrounds, different experiences,
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.840]   and so on, and we see how they are dealt with.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   We are dealing, of course, with actual history.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   But our main concern is not actually with the history.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.320]   We are not primarily just making studies of the characters of these men.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.040]   We are doing that only to the extent that it helps us to see the great principles.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.200]   The principles are still the same.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.160]   The Lord was here on earth, he's now in heaven, but he deals with us in exactly the
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   same way as he did in the days of his flesh.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   And what is important for us is, of course, that we should grasp these great principles.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:09.120]   And God grant that as we go on this morning, we shall again find encouragement to go forward,
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.400]   realizing that as he dealt with this man, Nathaniel, whom we are now going to look at,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   he deals still with his people.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.520]   Now we've looked at these different persons.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:28.200]   We looked at John the Evangelist himself and Andrew, and then we've looked at Philip,
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.160]   and we've looked at Simon, whose name was to be changed to that of Peter.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.420]   But now we come to this man, Nathaniel.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.560]   And again, we are dealing with actual history.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.680]   But again, I would remind you that what we must concentrate on is not just the history
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.280]   of Nathaniel, Quay, Nathaniel, but we must get hold of these principles that emerge from
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.000]   this particular incident.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.360]   It seems to me that one should never look at these biblical characters merely from the
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.800]   standpoint of the men themselves.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.560]   That was very fashionable towards the end of the last century and the early part of
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.560]   this century.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.280]   You'll find many volumes dealing with these biblical characters.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.000]   I've always had a feeling that they more or less missed the point, because they were
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.200]   too interested in the persons and not concerned sufficiently to watch the great principles
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.600]   that emerge in our Lord's dealing with the persons.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.960]   Well, let us, I say, try to bear that in mind.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   Now this case of Nathaniel, again, of course, brings out some of the general points which
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.720]   we've seen in the other instances also.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.800]   That's inevitable.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.320]   We are all arriving at the same goal.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.360]   We are all facing this great fullness which is in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.520]   There is that which is common, of course, in the life and the experience of all Christian
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   people.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.920]   And yet there are these most fascinating and interesting variations.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.520]   Now the great principle I want to try to show you that comes out in the case of Nathaniel
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.880]   is this one.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:20.040]   How are we to react when people come to us and tell us of some great experience that
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.400]   they've had in the realm of the Christian faith?
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.200]   Now so far in the other cases we've been looking chiefly at men who've gone to fetch
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.560]   others, the men who've been stating their experience.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.600]   And even in the case of Peter, that was the main emphasis, plus what our Lord said to
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.740]   him.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.200]   And that has been very important.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:51.480]   We have found that that is one of the tests that we must always apply to ourselves.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.920]   Do we know something about this urge within us to tell others?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.640]   The thing that John and Andrew had, the thing that Philip had, the feeling that we must
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.000]   tell them, the feeling that we are so anxious that they should also have it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's vital.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.380]   Now we are looking at the other side of this same picture.
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.420]   We are looking at the men who react to the message that is given to them, not so much
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:24.900]   the witness as the men who receive the witness, and how he reacts to it and how he behaves
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.820]   with respect to it.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.380]   This I think you'll all agree with me is a very important subject and a very vital
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.260]   one, and perhaps it has a new urgency just at this present time through which we are
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.060]   passing.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:47.180]   I think any pastor in this congregation will agree with me when I say that we have often
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.740]   had to spend a great deal of our time in dealing with people who've got into trouble because
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.940]   of their listening to what somebody else said to them.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.700]   Somebody has come to them and said, "Listen, I've had the most marvelous experience.
[00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.820]   I went to a meeting, something tremendous has happened to me.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.820]   This is the thing.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.820]   Come!"
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.020]   And they go and they find themselves in trouble.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.660]   Now that's the kind of picture that we're dealing with.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.220]   And of course there's something very natural about this.
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.780]   Anybody who truly examines himself or herself is aware of a certain sense of dissatisfaction.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.300]   Of course, if you've never been aware of dissatisfaction, I would query whether you've
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.220]   ever been a Christian at all.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.300]   There is a sense in which the true Christian is always dissatisfied.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.860]   He reads his scripture and they search him, and he's unhappy.
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.420]   He sees the possibilities, he says, "But I have so little."
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:50.620]   And so here are people who are dissatisfied with themselves as they are.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.380]   They have a longing and a desire within them to enjoy more.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.100]   They read the scriptures, they read the biographies of saints, they read of the history of the
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:07.380]   church in periods of revival, and this all creates a great hunger and thirst within them
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.980]   for some experience of the power of God and of the blessings of the Christian life, which
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.180]   they've never known hitherto.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.420]   Well, now here they are in that condition.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:25.140]   And somebody comes to them suddenly and says, "Listen, I've had the most marvelous experience.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.340]   Everything has changed," and so on.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.020]   And they describe it in graphic terms.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:39.000]   Now, such a person, I say, who receives such an intimation, is in many respects in a position
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   of danger.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.020]   The force, of course, of a personal experience is always very powerful, especially when you
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:55.780]   know people, as Nathaniel knew Philip, and as Peter knew Andrew, and so on.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.540]   You know people, you like them, you trust them, and therefore you are ready to listen
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.060]   to anything they may have to say.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:07.980]   All that plus the feeling you have within you of a lack and of a need.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:16.620]   Now here is the very material, I say, ready in which the enemy can come in and can do
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.620]   considerable harm.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.620]   Now, don't misunderstand me.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.700]   I'm not saying that it is always harmful.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.700]   Of course not.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.180]   Thank God for experiences.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.980]   Thank God for other people's testimonies when given in the right way, not when paraded
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:36.580]   or made a show of, but when it's done spontaneously, as it was done by Andrew and by Philip, just
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   out of the fullness of their hearts, unable to contain it and their love for the others.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.220]   Oh, thank God for this.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.060]   And the history of the Church, of course, is redolent with accounts of how many a man
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.660]   has finally been brought to a knowledge of Christ in salvation simply through what somebody
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.460]   else has said to him.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.940]   All I'm trying to show you is this, that while there is the good and the right side
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.780]   of that, there is the other side, unfortunately, also.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:08.340]   That is because of the devil and because we are what we are, because of our infirmities.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:16.180]   Now the case of Nathaniel I want to try to show you gives us great and invaluable instruction
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.020]   just at this very point.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.900]   Now this, you see, becomes important for the reason which I frequently give in handling
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:31.660]   this whole matter, namely, that unfortunately we are not only confronted by the truth, but
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.700]   by the counterfeit.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.500]   We are not only confronted by the Christian message, but the message of the cults, always
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.020]   offering some quick shortcut to some great experience.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:49.580]   And the people who are most liable to be deluded and misled by that very thing are the people
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.420]   who are most honest and sincere.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:58.980]   Therefore this teaching concerning Nathaniel I think we shall find is invaluable to us.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.020]   Let's try to divide it like this.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:10.860]   Let us first of all gather some lessons from the very character of Nathaniel.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.700]   Again let me remind you what we are concerned about is this.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:20.300]   How can I, from where I am, get to that mountaintop?
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.900]   How can I, as I am, struggling and worthy Christian, how can I rarely receive of that
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:32.780]   fullness and know that I am doing so, and be filled and be thrilled, knowing that I
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.420]   am baptized with the Holy Ghost?
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.420]   How can it happen?
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.380]   Well here are some of the indications from the very character of Nathaniel.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.380]   There are certain things which are of inestimable value always in that respect.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.100]   The first is this.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.500]   He was without God.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.780]   There are certain things which always please the Lord.
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.060]   And that is why it is important for us to concentrate on.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.580]   Our Lord saw Nathaniel coming.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:11.580]   Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said of him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.300]   whom is no guile."
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.860]   Our Lord was pleased with us.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.580]   And my dear friends, he is still pleased with us.
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.780]   This is something therefore within our reach and grasp.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:32.340]   The emphasis is not upon his ability, not upon his critical acumen, no, no, it is upon
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.380]   his character.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.700]   This is something that always wins the commendation of our Lord.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.220]   He is always interested in people in whom he finds this characteristic, without guile,
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.060]   which means sincere.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   It means, if you like, without hypocrisy.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.460]   This is one of these basic things.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:16:01.540]   It is all very well to desire great experiences, but my dear friend, if you are a hypocrite,
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.540]   you have got to deal with that.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.460]   It is no use here thinking of this other.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.380]   Hypocrisy excludes the blessing, invariably.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.660]   Hypocrisy is always hopeless.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:18.500]   Now, this is something, of course, that is emphasized throughout the entire Bible.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.260]   I am not suggesting, of course, that sincerity alone is enough.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260]   It isn't.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.340]   But I am saying that without it, the blessing doesn't come.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:34.180]   A man can be quite sincere, doesn't guarantee the blessing, but if he isn't sincere, he
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.300]   has no right even to expect the blessing.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.460]   Now, the Bible is full of this.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:44.660]   The psalmist, these men who knew themselves and who knew the laws of the spiritual life
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.100]   so well, constantly they concentrate on this.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.540]   If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.660]   If I am harboring some sin and I know that there is something wrong, it is no use my
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.180]   praying to God, says the psalmist.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180]   The thing is ridiculous.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   It is a mockery.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.180]   That is hypocrisy.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.460]   I am trying to do two things at the same time.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.700]   I am trying to give the impression that I am a man whom in reality I am not.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   So he puts it like that.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:20.340]   If I regard, if I fondle, shield any iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.340]   I am guilty of guile.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.340]   I am not sincere.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:30.340]   And again the psalmist puts it like this.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.740]   Thou desirest truth in the inward paths.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.700]   It is an absolute rule, this.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.540]   God knoweth the heart.
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.260]   God knows all about us.
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:48.340]   And he desires truth in the inward paths, not merely outside, not merely confession
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.220]   with the lips, not merely statements and doing things.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.540]   God knoweth the heart.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.980]   Now our Lord himself, you remember, brought this very charge against the Pharisees.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:07.060]   You were they, he said, which justify yourselves before men, but God seeth the heart.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.380]   And that which is highly esteemed amongst men is abomination in the sight of God.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.140]   It is no good.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.640]   It does not work.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.860]   And again the psalmist puts it like this, you see.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:23.340]   He says, unite my heart to sing thy praise.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:31.500]   He realized this division, part good, part bad, desiring, yet desiring the world, this
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.380]   disunited heart, this divided heart.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:40.380]   So he puts it like that, divide, unite my heart to sing thy praise.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.380]   And we sang it in our hymn just now.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.220]   Grant us thy light that we may learn.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.060]   How dead is life from thee apart.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:56.700]   How sure is joy for all who turn to thee, an undivided heart.
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.420]   It's absolutely essential.
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:08.020]   Unless we have an undivided heart, there is not much point in our praying or longing or
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:14.380]   seeking for some great and higher experience in the Christian life.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:22.300]   In other words, this story of Nathanael emphasizes once more the vital importance of our motive.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   The motive is all important.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.580]   And the devil would have us covet and seek rich experiences in order that we may enjoy
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.580]   them.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.860]   But my dear friends, our Lord has settled this once and forever in one of the great
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.860]   Beatitudes.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:44.140]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst, not after thrills and excitements, nor even
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.660]   after happiness, but after righteousness.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.620]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst, after righteousness they shall be filled.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.180]   We've got to be honest in this matter, or take the way in which James deals with it
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:03.420]   in his epistle in chapter 4 and verse 3.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.660]   You ask and receive not, says James, why?
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:12.020]   You know the people who are praying and they complain to their teachers, is there any point
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   in praying?
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.940]   I've been praying for a long time but I haven't had the blessing.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:16.940]   Is God true?
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.820]   Does God really keep his promises?
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.540]   It's all right, says James, you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.220]   it upon your lusts.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.140]   What a terrible thing this is, and yet how true it is.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.620]   It's been the ruination of many a preacher.
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.180]   He's pleaded for power, he wanted power.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180]   Why?
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.460]   Well, that he might consume it on his lusts, that people might praise him, that he might
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.180]   do certain things.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.300]   You ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lusts.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.100]   Why do we pray for experiences?
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.060]   Why are we coveting these higher reaches of the Christian life?
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.540]   My friends, the motive is all important, so James goes on to say, cleanse your hands,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:10.420]   you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.540]   Now the glory of this man Nathanael was that he wasn't double-minded.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.900]   He wasn't a hypocrite.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.540]   He wasn't insincere.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:24.500]   He was an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:30.740]   Very well, my friend, it comes down to this then as a first principle.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:36.420]   There is no point and purpose in praying, or agonizing, or attending meetings, or doing
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:47.060]   anything, if in the meantime you are deliberately holding on to something wrong and sinful.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.260]   There's no purpose in it.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.380]   God cannot be mocked.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.100]   He knows, he sees all.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.260]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:06.380]   Neither is anything hid from his sight.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.740]   There is no point then, I say, in praying or doing anything in an attempt to receive
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   some blessing and experience, if you're guilty of that, or putting it the other way
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:22.140]   around, if you refuse to yield to God's will in something in which he's made it
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.260]   perfectly plain and clear to you.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.820]   Now don't misunderstand this.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.620]   I'm not here to say, "If you therefore get rid of sin and surrender yourself, you're
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.260]   bound to have the blessing, and you can take it by faith."
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.380]   That is not what I am saying at all.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.340]   I believe that is false to the scriptural teaching.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.620]   These things are merely negatives.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:52.860]   If there is guile, you have no right to expect anything.
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.540]   But your sincerity alone doesn't guarantee the blessing.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.580]   Nevertheless, it is something that is well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.580]   It is something he delights to see.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.100]   And when he sees a man like that coming, he says, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.940]   whom is no guile."
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.980]   Very well, let's start with that.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:21.740]   The second thing that he obviously likes about Nathanael is that Nathanael was concerned
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:29.580]   about these things, and was not merely interested in them, but had got a deep heart desire with
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.260]   respect to them.
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:37.980]   That comes out, of course, in our Lord's telling him that he had known him and had
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.460]   seen him when he was under the fig tree, before that Philip called thee, when thou was under
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.620]   the fig tree, I saw thee.
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.700]   Now everybody really is agreed about this.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.220]   We don't know exactly what Philip was doing under the fig tree, but it's generally agreed
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:24:00.980]   that he was there, undoubtedly concerned about these things, concerned about his soul, concerned
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.900]   about his relationship to God.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   He's an Israelite, remember, and he's been brought up in these things, but he's not
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:15.660]   content with a mere formality, external religion, or with a mere general notion about these
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.660]   matters.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.820]   No, no, this is a vital thing to this man, and there he is under the fig tree.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.500]   What's he doing there?
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.340]   Well, he's a man who takes time to think about these things.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.100]   He gets away from the world.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.020]   He goes out of the house, and he sits under the fig tree.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.780]   Branches came low, and the leaves were covering him.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:41.260]   It was a kind of little sanctum into which a man could retire, get away from conversation
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:48.740]   and bustle and noise and business, and just remind himself about these things that pertain
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.620]   to the soul and to one's eternal destiny.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.820]   Now our Lord commends this.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:03.260]   Our Lord likes a man who really has a living concern about these things, to whom his religion
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.100]   is not something that he carries in a bag, as it were, picks it up on a Sunday morning,
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.340]   puts it down, he's done his duty, there it is.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:16.180]   No, no, he has a man who during the week sits under the fig tree.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:23.620]   And there he reads his scripture, and there he meditates upon it, there he studies it,
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.700]   and there he prays, and there he worships God.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.500]   This to him is the biggest thing in life.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.180]   What was he meditating upon?
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.900]   Well, again, I'm ready to agree with those who say that he may well have been meditating
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   about the whole story of Jacob, one of the great fathers of Israel, and how he slept
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.660]   that night and suddenly found it was the house of God and the great gateway of heaven.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:54.020]   All right, quite likely, but what I am certain of is this, that he was deeply concerned about
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.980]   these things.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:01.100]   And this again is one of these fundamental rules.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:08.860]   You read any biography you like of any individual who has ever known some great and glorious
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:15.260]   experience of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will always find that they were people
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:20.180]   who were dissatisfied, they were concerned, they were hungry, and they were doing something
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.860]   about it.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:28.100]   Now, this needs to be emphasized, doesn't it, to this generation to which you and I
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.100]   belong.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   We are the busy people.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.300]   Of course, we've got more leisure than people have ever had.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   But the great complaint is, "I haven't got time."
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:40.780]   People have got no time to read big books, digests, snippets, quotations here and there.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.420]   "I haven't got time," they say, "to read the big books, to read the Bible right
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.180]   through, small portions."
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.540]   And we think we're wonderful.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.900]   My dear friends, that's never the way to know God.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.540]   Take time to be holy.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.540]   Take time.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:00.500]   Now, here's the man who took the time, and there he is under the fig tree.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.180]   And I say that this again is one of those absolute rules in this whole matter of the
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.740]   culture of the spiritual life.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.260]   You must not only be sincere, you must be concerned.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.380]   You must be a seeker.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.740]   You must be doing all you can to arrive at this.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.980]   This must be the central thing in your life.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   Very well.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:25.020]   You get the same statement made, of course, about Cornelius.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.860]   That's one of the striking things about the story of Cornelius in the tenth chapter of
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.060]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.460]   Here again was a man who was seeking, and God had noted him.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.100]   And Peter says, "I see that God is no respecter of persons, but in all nations he's got
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   these people.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.940]   These are the people who are going to get the blessing."
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   Very well.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.940]   Let's leave it at that.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.900]   But now I come to what is to me the central point in this whole matter, which is the lessons
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.980]   we can learn from Nathaniel's reaction to Philip's testimony.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.020]   Here, I think, is the crucial point.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:07.660]   Here is this godly, guileless man, longing to know God in a manner that he's never known
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:16.340]   him hitherto, thinking about the coming Messiah, as all godly Israelites were doing.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:25.580]   And suddenly, his friend Philip bursts upon him and makes this tremendous and staggering
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.580]   announcement.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.780]   He rushes in and says, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:37.180]   did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.620]   But actually, you know, this translation of ours, while it's quite accurate, it doesn't
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.300]   put the words in the right order.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.060]   What Philip actually said was this, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:57.420]   the prophets did write, him, Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth."
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.380]   He ended with the word "Nazareth."
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.140]   And that's the key to the understanding, in a sense, of this incident.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.340]   Now then, the question is, how did Nathanael react to this intimation?
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:14.980]   His friend is obviously moved, he's excited, he's feeling the thing deeply and profoundly.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.820]   And he says, "Come, this is most amazing, we've found him, the one we've been looking
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.300]   for, the one we've often spoken about together.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:26.980]   He's come, come and see him, this Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth."
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:33.780]   That's how people come to us, isn't it, and say, "Listen, it is marvelous, wonderful.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.140]   You know, we've been talking about it, I've got it, this is it."
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.500]   Isn't that how they come to you?
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.140]   Very well, how should one react to that kind of intimation?
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.380]   Now, here's the wonderful teaching.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:52.700]   The first thing we notice about Nathanael is this, that he is not guilty of credulity.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.460]   He wasn't a credulous person.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.460]   What do I mean?
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.060]   I mean this, he's not carried away uncritically by the news.
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.140]   He doesn't thoughtlessly get up and run with Philip, no, no.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:14.860]   He pauses, he exercises his critical faculty, he notices this word "Nazareth" and he's
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.340]   disturbed by that.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.980]   He doesn't accept the whole testimony and swallow it all as it were and rush, no, no.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.740]   He says, "Wait a minute."
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:31.580]   He says, Nathanael said then to him, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:37.020]   Now, I'm going to deal with the meaning of that question in detail in a moment.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:43.820]   All I'm concerned to emphasize at this point is simply this, that the man at Enneret has
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.740]   his critical faculty alive and alert.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:55.340]   He doesn't just take the testimony as it is and swallow it whole and immediately act,
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.340]   no.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:03.700]   He is thoughtful, he is critical, he is wide awake and this is a part of this man's whole
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   glory.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.940]   It is a part of the explanation of how he became the man he became.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.460]   Now he knows Philip and he likes him and so on, but he doesn't take it just as it is.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.740]   He notices this odd point, "Nazareth" concentrates on it and he must be satisfied before he proceeds
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.740]   any further.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.740]   That's the first thing.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.940]   He's the second guilty of credulity.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:34.020]   I needn't stay to apply these things, need I, in detail.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.780]   There are many amongst us, my dear friends, are there not, who are guilty of credulity.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.340]   They'll believe anything.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:44.140]   They always jump at the latest cult or the latest emphasis.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.340]   They are looking for something and here is the experience and they're after it.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:52.180]   They rush into it without any thought or any contemplation.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.100]   Now Nathaniel didn't.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.940]   That's the first thing.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.540]   But let me emphasize the exact opposite.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.380]   And this is where we see this man shining out in such a wonderful manner.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:11.660]   He's not guilty of credulity, neither is he guilty of a blind prejudice, which rejects
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:18.420]   everything out of hand and with contempt, because he is not familiar with it.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.420]   Now this is wonderful.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.540]   You've got to hold these two sides, my friend.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.340]   You see, we are all familiar with the ecstatic, excitable kind of person who'll believe
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.780]   anything and rushes madly into it.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:36.820]   Yes, but we are also familiar, are we not, with this other type of person, who hearing
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:44.700]   a word like Nazareth, with contempt dismisses the whole thing and who says, "This is
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.700]   rubbish.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.700]   This is nonsense.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:52.220]   The fact that it comes from Nazareth is in and of itself sufficient to prove that the
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.340]   thing cannot be true and it cannot be genuine.
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.900]   I'm not interested at all.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.900]   Leave me alone.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.700]   I'm here with my meditations.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   I'm really studying.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.060]   I'm out for the truth.
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.060]   This is rubbish, nonsense.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.060]   Down it goes."
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:08.780]   No, you see, Nathaniel didn't do that.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.580]   And this is as important as the first point.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.420]   Isn't it interesting how these two groups of people have persisted throughout the centuries
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.940]   and are so evident at the present time?
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.820]   There are people who are ready to believe anything and to rush into it, and there are
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.940]   other people who seem to be waiting to turn things down.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   They look for any loophole, any slip in a word.
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.220]   They condemn a man on a phrase, on a word.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.220]   Down he goes.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.100]   One thing wrong, nothing right.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.740]   Out it goes.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:47.660]   And I'm trying to show you that both those attitudes are equally bad and equally wrong.
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.420]   These second people never want to be disturbed.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.140]   They've got a little religion of their own.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.100]   They've worked it out and there it is.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.900]   They think it's going to take them to heaven.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.820]   And if people come and tell them about some amazing experience they've had, they don't
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.460]   like it because it disturbs them.
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.060]   It doesn't fit into their little pattern.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   They reject it out of hand.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.060]   Now where's it from?
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   Ah, here it is.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.420]   Down it goes.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.700]   That is a terrible sin to be guilty of.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:25.020]   But you see, this man, Nathaniel, he avoids both those errors and both those extremes.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.860]   And the lesson we should learn from him this morning is this one.
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:36.740]   That though he is awake and alive and alert and is using and exercising his critical faculties
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:41.660]   and the mind that God has given him, he is ready nevertheless to listen.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:47.700]   "Nathaniel said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:52.100]   Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.540]   And this is the wonderful thing he went.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.220]   Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him."
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.180]   He's not happy about this thing.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.140]   This word Nazareth troubles him.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.900]   It puts him off.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.060]   Nevertheless he's prepared to go and listen.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.180]   He doesn't reject the thing out of hand.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.820]   He's prepared to investigate.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.180]   He's prepared to examine.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.580]   He isn't governed by blind prejudices.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:17.260]   Here's the lesson.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.860]   He knows Philip, I say, and he can see at once that something extraordinary has happened
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.500]   to him.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:28.260]   He can see a light in his eye and can sense something in his spirit that he's never known
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.260]   before.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.180]   So he's open and he's ready to listen.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.900]   And my dear friends, you and I must be like this.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.340]   This is the only way really to get to know God.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.500]   You may have a rigid intellectual system.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.380]   Very well, you'll go to your grave with it and you'll never have the greatest experiences
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.620]   of God in this life and in this world.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:51.100]   Or on the other hand, you may rush so uncritically into everything that you're told of that
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:56.140]   you'll be constantly in trouble and going from one to the next, never having peace and
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.300]   rest in your soul.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.660]   Oh, let's avoid both these dangers.
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.300]   Let's follow the example of Nathaniel.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.980]   Here's the right method.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:14.060]   Our minds must be open, we must be ready to listen, we must be ready to learn.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:17.860]   But the whole time we must continue with our testing.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:26.660]   Now, you see, Nathaniel puts his question, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.660]   What does it mean?
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.340]   Well, there are some who say that it just means that there was a common saying about
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.620]   Nazareth that it was such a terrible place that no good could ever come out of it.
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.980]   It was a bad place, of course.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   Nazareth was a very evil place, as in a sense was the whole of Galilee by contrast with
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.980]   Judah.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.740]   And there are those who say that this is just a matter of prejudice.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.180]   I don't accept it for a moment.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:53.140]   It doesn't seem to me to fit in with the character of this man, Nathaniel.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.140]   What is it?
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:59.380]   I think here was a man who was not only serious, but was very well versed in the Scriptures.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:00.860]   And I think he argued like this.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.900]   He said, "Did you say Nazareth?"
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.740]   But there's nothing in the Scriptures to say that the Messiah comes from Nazareth.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.260]   He comes from Bethlehem.
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.700]   He's the son of David.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.420]   He's of the seed of David.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.740]   And he is to be born in Bethlehem.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:17.820]   You remember that when the wise men came to King Herod to inquire as to where the Messiah
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.900]   was to be born, they looked up the records, they said, "Bethlehem."
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.840]   And these men argued in the same way.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.580]   So when he hears Nazareth, he says, "But wait a minute.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:33.300]   You say we have found him who was spoken of by Moses in the law, and about whom the prophets
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   wrote."
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.420]   But he says, "You know, I don't recall anything about Nazareth.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   It's Bethlehem.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.660]   There's something wrong here."
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660]   Now that's wonderful.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:44.300]   That's absolutely right.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   What I mean is this.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:54.080]   Nathaniel, of course, was actually wrong in his facts, but his method was right, and his
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.880]   principle was right.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   You see, the fact that Philip has had a wonderful experience doesn't convince Nathaniel if
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.400]   there is an obvious glaring error in it.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.640]   He must be put right on this.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.640]   He tests it by the Scripture.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:18.400]   And he is prepared to listen further, but it's got to be in conformity with the Scripture.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.480]   And there is this great rule that we must never forget, and that we must always apply
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.080]   to anything that presents itself to us in the Christian realm.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.680]   It doesn't matter what it is, whether it's preaching or evangelism or teaching or experiences,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.400]   everything must be brought to the bar of the Scripture.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.520]   It doesn't matter how wonderful, it doesn't matter what the results may be.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.080]   Is it Scriptural?
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:47.040]   Does it conform with God's revealed plan?
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.520]   Nathaniel applies that test.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:59.440]   And so, you see, though he's actually wrong in his deduction, because he holds on to his
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.800]   principle, he's right.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.360]   And the man who does that, who holds on to the Scripture, not with the idea of turning
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.080]   everything down, but in order to test it to see if it really is right, he's the man who
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.640]   eventually is going to arrive at the blessing.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:19.360]   So I would sum up this whole section by putting it like this.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:27.080]   We must avoid fanaticism and wild and critical ecstasy.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   That's bad.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.200]   False fire has done endless harm in the life of the individual Christian and in the life
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.500]   of the whole Church.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:43.140]   We must avoid fanaticism, but at the same time, and with equal care, we must avoid quenching
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.340]   the Spirit.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.020]   We must avoid this attitude of the Pharisees, always looking for a loophole, always waiting
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:55.380]   to condemn, always because we don't understand the thing in detail, turning it down, throwing
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.740]   everything out.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:06.700]   Isn't the lesson of Nathaniel badly needed at the present time?
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.860]   We have got to keep a balance in these matters.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.460]   And God forgive those who belong to either of those wrong groups.
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.180]   God keep us at the center.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.500]   God keep us with the Scriptures.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.300]   God keep us in the place in which we'll exercise the faculties he's given us.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:29.620]   But in the light of the teaching of the Scriptures, everything must be brought to the bar of the
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.620]   Scripture.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:39.760]   For any knowledge or any news or any experience that contradicts this is not of God.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.660]   We are to test the Spirits.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:46.900]   We are to prove the Spirits, whether they be of God.
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:52.420]   And we do so, as Nathaniel did, by putting them up against the test of the Scriptures.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.420]   Very well.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:00.420]   Having dealt with that, let me end on the greatest encouragement of all, which is this.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:06.340]   The lessons we can derive from our Lord's handling of Nathaniel.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.160]   Thank God for this.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.420]   You see, we are fallible at best.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.220]   Nathaniel, though he's such a good man, and though he works on the right principle, he
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.220]   doesn't know his Scriptures perfectly.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.620]   He had forgotten all about Nazareth and such possibilities, and about the Son of God coming
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.220]   out of Egypt and so on.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.420]   These were things that the people tended to miss.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.940]   And that's how they'd gone astray.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.500]   But his principle is right.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.500]   And as long as these things are true of us, well then, this is how the Lord will handle
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.040]   us.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:44.340]   He let Nathaniel know that he knew him and that he knew him directly.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:51.140]   He sees him coming, and he says, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.940]   And Nathaniel says unto him, "Whence knowest thou me?"
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.660]   Now that's an important question.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.660]   You see, what Nathaniel was really saying was this.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:05.820]   Tell me, has Philip told you about me?
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.340]   Or has somebody else told you about me?
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   How do you know me?
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.140]   Have they been telling you about me?
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.500]   They've been with you, they've come to tell me.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.660]   Did Philip, while he was with you, did he tell you about his friend Nathaniel?
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.220]   Is that how you know about me?
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:27.740]   And our Lord says, "No, it isn't, because Philip has told me."
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.900]   I have known you apart from Philip.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:37.420]   Jesus answered and said unto him, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:42.140]   the fig tree, I saw thee."
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:48.900]   Oh, there's nothing more blessed than that, than to know that he has seen us.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.140]   He doesn't depend upon the knowledge and information others may give him about us.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:54.380]   He knows us apart from that.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:55.740]   He knows us directly.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:56.740]   He knows us immediately.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.140]   "Before Philip has arrived at Nathaniel, I saw thee, I was watching you."
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.300]   There under that fig tree.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.140]   This is the whole glory of salvation.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.820]   He knows us.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:20.700]   Our names were written in the Lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.500]   He not only knows us, he knows all about us.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:32.060]   "Before that Philip called thee, while when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.100]   He knows all about your desires.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.940]   He knows about your heartaches.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.260]   He knows about your longings.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.900]   He knows about your searchings.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.780]   He knows all about your prayers.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.720]   My friend, you feel discouraged.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.220]   You feel, "I've been trying for years.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.220]   I've been reading my Bible.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.220]   I've been praying.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.500]   I've done everything I can, but I don't seem to be growing.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   Nothing's happening."
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.700]   And your devil comes and says, "Give it all up."
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   Don't I say?
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:59.140]   He knows all about it.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:05.220]   In every pang that rends the heart, the man of sorrows has a part.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.660]   He knows all about you.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.580]   There's nothing to me more wonderful about the conversion of Saul of Tarsus than just
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.580]   that.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:22.420]   How the Lord looked down upon him and said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.420]   He knew him.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.380]   He addressed him by his name.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.780]   "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:34.060]   He knew what had been going on, the struggle, the doubts, and the fanaticism which was increasing
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.460]   because of the doubts.
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.860]   I know all about you, Saul.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.540]   Same thing.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:51.140]   He not only knows us directly, he not only knows all about us, he's concerned for us.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.980]   And he's vitally interested in us so that as we make any slight move in his direction,
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.980]   he'll encourage us.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:03.580]   When he saw Nathaniel coming, he said, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.820]   What a wonderful thing for him to say to a man.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.820]   But he does that.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.260]   He'll give you encouragement.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:12.340]   You make any move in his direction, he'll be more than halfway to meet you.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.260]   Like the father of the prodigal, you'll have a welcome, he'll encourage you, he'll
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.780]   draw you to him.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:25.620]   And he'll praise all that is good in you.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.980]   But above all, he's very ready to be patient with us.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.340]   He is ready for us to question him.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.700]   He is ready to give us answers.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.100]   He knows our frame, he remembereth that we are of the dust.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.660]   He doesn't dismiss us because we haven't reached a hundred percent perfection.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.740]   No, no.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.460]   He knows exactly where we are.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.980]   He sees the possibilities.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.460]   He takes us by the hand.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:57.980]   God, you remember, tells Israel that he took him by the hand and he was all right while
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.180]   he was a little child being led by the hand.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.580]   Well, he still does the same thing.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.900]   He'll be patient and long-suffering and he'll lead us on.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:14.980]   Here is the Lord in all the glory of his divine nature, looking, revealing his knowledge,
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:20.540]   his omniscience, and dealing with us as the almighty Savior.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.100]   Very well.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:28.100]   Shall we close this service by my putting some questions to you based upon all that
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.540]   we've been seeing together?
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:37.060]   What is your greatest desire?
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.700]   What is it that you desire this morning above everything else?
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:47.500]   Have you got that fig tree?
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:53.980]   Do you spend time there thinking, meditating, longing, desiring?
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.860]   Is this the biggest thing?
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.580]   This is a vital question.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.500]   Are you content with a formal Christianity, a formal religion?
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.940]   God have mercy upon you.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.220]   Can you say that your greatest desire with the Apostle Paul is that I might know him
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:13.940]   and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:19.580]   unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead?
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:23.300]   Is that it?
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:28.820]   That I might know thee, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.020]   Is that your greatest desire?
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.540]   But let me go on.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.260]   Here's a question.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:43.140]   Do you know that you are known of him?
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.340]   Just imagine the feelings of Nathaniel when he heard our Lord uttering these words about
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.340]   him.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.060]   And when our Lord revealed to him that he'd known all about him there under the fig tree,
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.460]   he knows that he's known.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:48:02.940]   There is nothing in life comparable to this than just to know that you are known of God.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:04.700]   Listen to the statements in the scripture.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:09.860]   If any man love God, the same says Paul to the Corinthians, is known of him.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.300]   1 Corinthians 8.3.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   If any man love God, not the man who's puffed up with knowledge.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:18.780]   Knowledge puffeth up, charity edifieth.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:23.860]   If any man love God, here's the wonderful thing.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:28.020]   The same is known of him.
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.020]   God knows him.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.780]   Or listen again to 1 Corinthians 13.12.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:37.020]   Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:42.420]   Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known.
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.220]   Here it is.
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.480]   Or take Galatians 4.9.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:55.420]   But know after that you have known God, or rather, are known of God.
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:02.980]   This is the thing in which the Apostle Paul rejoiced, that God knew him.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.020]   That God was interested in him.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.740]   That God was concerned about him.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.140]   My dear friend, now all I'm asking you is this.
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.540]   I'm not asking you what great things you've done.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.420]   I'm not asking you what marvelous experiences you've had.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.320]   I'm just asking you this.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.780]   Do you know that God knows you?
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.100]   That Christ knows you?
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.980]   That he set his heart upon you?
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.680]   And that you are one of the people for whom he died on Calvary's hill?
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.780]   This is something one knows in the depths of one's being.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.820]   You can't prove it, but you just know it.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:42.700]   You say, "Whatever I am, however unworthy I am, I know.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.060]   I belong to him."
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.720]   Like Peter, you see.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:56.020]   When our Lord put the question to him, "Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these?"
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.740]   And he upbraided Peter for his denial, and he pressed him.
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.660]   And Peter at last burst out saying, "Lord, thou knowest all things.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.080]   Thou knowest that I love thee."
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:13.380]   And this other side, that he knows us.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.780]   This is the greatest encouragement a feeble Christian can ever have.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:27.940]   "Lord, it is my chief complaint that my love is weak and faint, yet I love thee and adore
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:32.340]   all for grace to love thee more."
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:37.180]   You know that he loves you, and that's what makes you feel so ashamed of yourself.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:40.240]   That you are what you are, and that you love him so little.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.900]   So I ask my final question, do you know that he is dealing with you?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.860]   Have you this feeling within you that you're being dealt with?
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.180]   That he has taken an interest in your case?
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.900]   He's drawing you.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:51:00.940]   I say again, there's nothing more wonderful than that.
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:06.420]   And to know that however faltering your steps may be, and however many and greater your
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:14.100]   failures, that he is dealing with you.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:23.180]   And that at your worst you can turn to him and say, "O Lamb that wilt not let me go,
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:28.780]   I rest my weary soul in thee.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:35.580]   I give thee back the life I owe, that in thy notion depths its flow may richer, fuller
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   be."
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.580]   Do you know that?
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.620]   Have you felt the touch of his power?
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:46.340]   Do you feel that he is dealing with you, that he's started the good work?
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:54.060]   For we have this great assurance through the Apostle Paul, that he which hath begun a good
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:52:04.220]   work in us will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.220]   Amen.
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:22.460]   The closing hymn is hymn number 400, hymn number 400, object of my first desire, "Jesus
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.660]   crucified for me," hymn number 400.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:27.660]   [music]
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:54.660]   [music]
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:16.660]   [music]
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   May the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:30.660]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:39.620]   of this hour's short and sudden earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see him
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:45.660]   as he is and be like him in the glory everlasting.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.700]   Amen.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.620]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
