[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   I think you can make much better decisions about what do I want to do with my time?
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.460]   How do I want to spend my time with who, at what frequency, et cetera?
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.760]   I think those are the types of decisions that really impact your life because you can start
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.500]   going down a path.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.040]   And once you realize that, so I talked a little bit about the level four stuff, it's because
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.120]   most people are going to get stuck in there.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.860]   They'll never get out.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.000]   And you're spending all this time running on the hamster wheel and you're never going
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.380]   to get out.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.960]   And it doesn't really impact your wealth that much anymore.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.380]   And you're working so hard for what?
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.240]   And I don't understand why people do it.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.680]   And so I think that's a big mindset shift is like realizing, okay, once you understand
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.980]   the lap, the ladder and all the decisions behind it, you can make much better decisions on about
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.060]   how you use your time and what you do with your life.
