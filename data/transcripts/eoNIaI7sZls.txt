[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   One of the real highlights of our annual conference is that the Bogleheads get a chance to have
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.440]   their questions answered directly by Vanguard founder Jack Bogle.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.080]   This year's moderator of the Q&A with Jack is a retired Mobil Oil Corporation human resource
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   executive.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.980]   He discovered the Bogleheads in 2001 and he and his wife Patty attended their first Bogleheads
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.560]   conference in Denver in 2004.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.520]   They've both been active in the Bogleheads community since that time.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.160]   They live in the Northern Virginia area and started the Washington, D.C. area Bogleheads
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.720]   local chapter.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:53.060]   Please welcome my good friend and conference teammate, Ed Rager.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:06.860]   Please give another very warm welcome to our very special guest of honor, Mr. Jack Bogle.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:22.020]   Now, without further ado, let's get started with the Q&A.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020]   Take it in.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.840]   Just let me say one quick thing.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.060]   I spoke at the NASD, I had a big, long speech, NASD, National Association of Security Dealers,
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.740]   in Washington about a decade ago, and when I was introduced, they gave me a standing
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.740]   ovation.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:47.360]   I looked at the audience and said, "Why didn't you say that until after I spoke?"
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100]   We know this crowd loves you, and that's why we're here.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.420]   So you'll probably get another one before the day's out.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.260]   Okay, so I've got a number of questions, and we'll get to as many of them as we can.
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.780]   This first one is from an attendee named Fred Beery.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.340]   He says, "The market has been up for years, and I have gained more than I expected.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.660]   In setting up a donor-advisor fund for charitable giving over the next, say, 10 years, what
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.980]   allocation would you suggest between U.S. equities, bonds, dare I ask international,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.380]   to maximize the returns for the charities I give to?"
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.420]   Well, first of all, if you're going to have a balanced program, which is what you laid
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.740]   out there, you're not going to maximize your return.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.260]   The best way to maximize your return is to, in the long run, maybe not from here, is to
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.020]   buy the S&P 500 and leverage it.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020]   You don't want to do that.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.180]   It's a prudent thing, so the real question is not to get maximum returns, but what is
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.380]   the best way to get prudent returns?
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:07.220]   I would stick with the balanced index fund formula of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and maybe
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.900]   for a program like this, 65%, but you really can't make an argument over 65 or 60, because
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.180]   nobody knows, and God knows Bogle doesn't know.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.940]   So should international non-U.S. be in that 60%, I don't think you need it, and I don't
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.760]   think the rest of the world will do as well as the U.S., but I'm wrong so often in my
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   new book.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.700]   I spend more time talking about the things I did wrong than the things I did right.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.380]   So it's a matter of judgment, and I'd say maybe to honor the principle, let's call it
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.660]   Taylor's principle of three-fund portfolio, you might have 10% to 20% of the stock position.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.660]   No more than that in non-U.S. stocks.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.780]   Okay, thank you.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.740]   This next one is from Adam Manwaran.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.780]   Since attending the Bogle Heads Conference for the first time last year, I've been quickly
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.020]   moving my asset allocation toward Taylor Laramore's three-fund portfolio.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.820]   Recently, I've been lured into the Vanguard Active Alpha Seeking ETFs.
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.180]   After rereading your article on reversion to the mean, am I just chasing my tail with
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.740]   that active ETF bet?
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.540]   Yes.
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.720]   I think that answer is fairly clear.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.220]   So Adam, listen up.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.100]   This next one is from Trey Parrish.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.700]   As a retiree in mid-retirement, given your lower projections for stock market returns
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.940]   over the next 10 years, should I reduce my stock exposure in my portfolio since CD rates
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.220]   are rising and becoming more attractive, and how can I determine the appropriate stock
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.220]   allocation?
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.020]   Well, you know, I've said before this is a really hard time to invest.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.740]   I would say as a general principle, with a stock market at these levels, it is probably
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.380]   a good idea to, as Baron Rothschild said, to sell to the sleeping point, to sell stocks
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.140]   where you're not worried about it.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.700]   Maybe a 10% percentage point reduction in the stock position, maybe not.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.380]   What makes this time so different is that bond yields are so low, and they're going
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.300]   up admittedly, the treasury is up to, I think someone said 3.2%, 25-year treasury, 30-year
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.660]   treasury, and the stock market is 1.8, so you get a higher yield, but these are not
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.820]   really super yields.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:51.540]   And so it's really not a question, an easy question to answer, because it depends not
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.180]   only on your ability to withstand a market decline, your financial ability, but on your
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.860]   emotional ability to withstand a market decline.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.660]   So you're asking me to do not only a financial analysis, but a psychological analysis, which
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.020]   I'm not prepared to do on the information contained in one or two sentences.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:20.060]   But I would say the biggest mistake investors make is when they think the market is high.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.060]   They get out.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.060]   They go zero.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.220]   That is the dumbest thing you can possibly do, because there's no certainty in this.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.060]   So in my book, which I think, since I've signed so many, I don't feel badly about
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.100]   blacking it a little bit, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, and I say never
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.460]   have less than 25% of inequities, and never more.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.020]   There are exceptions to both of those, but I would kind of stick to that.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.260]   Just make sure you've got a decent position.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.700]   And I would think today would probably be a time to make a very, if this is the way
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.460]   the investor feels, this makes you more comfortable, makes you sleep better, to do some kind of
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.340]   a 5 or 10 percentage point reduction.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:07.260]   So if he's at 65%, to go to 60 or 55.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.300]   But there's no-- I don't know how to get across.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.320]   People ask me these kinds of questions all the time.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.180]   There's no certainty about this.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.900]   You could be so terribly wrong that you don't want to do anything too big.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.820]   But in general, I'd say if you're at 60, 40-- and I happen to be 50/50 myself.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.340]   I told you that yesterday.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.780]   And I spent half my time wondering why I have so much in stocks, and the other half wondering
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.020]   why I have so little.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.020]   The investor's dilemma, I think I call it.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.340]   But it gets to-- presumably, the financial ability to withstand risk is there, and the
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.980]   emotional ability there.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.860]   You have to-- the investor has to ask for himself.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.620]   But if you're really bothered, really scared, do something.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.580]   I mean, life is too short.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.660]   But are there precise answers to the question?
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.660]   No.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.460]   There aren't precise answers to anything in the field of investing.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.220]   OK.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.420]   This is from Duncan Rankin.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:15.420]   If all of your portfolio is inside Roth IRAs, is it better to use Taylor's three-fund portfolio
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:22.340]   or use an equivalent target date or life strategy fund?
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.020]   Nobody knows.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.020]   Nobody knows.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.620]   You know, the target date is an interesting kind of an idea.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.680]   Your equities go down as your age goes up.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.420]   Your bonds go up as your age goes up.
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.980]   And Taylor's three-fund portfolio is presumably a buy and hold.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.620]   And that could easily do better, but could easily do worse.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.980]   There's just no way that I could think of a balanced portfolio in any event.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.060]   And there's no way that I could predict which will do better.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:03.460]   But if it were me-- we are a funny, funny crowd, these investors, we investors.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.820]   I would do the simple portfolio rather than the complex portfolio.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.100]   Now that means you don't have as much fun game-playing.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.640]   It's kind of boring to have all your money in the balanced index fund.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   What do you do?
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.260]   You don't look at it once a year, maybe, and take it from there.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:29.700]   So there's just kind of, as the old saying goes, how many angels can dance on the head
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.060]   of a pin?
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.740]   And that's how much you should have in one or the other.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.300]   I just can't answer the question.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.660]   This is from Merrill Moore.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:53.100]   What is the single best piece of advice or lesson that you want to pass on to your heirs?
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.140]   I'm thinking.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:04.620]   Well, that's a very hard question, because getting-- when you get into-- I presume investment
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620]   advice or not.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.260]   Just say a single best piece of advice or lesson.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:20.620]   Well, obviously, the best single advice is never lose your humanity.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.300]   Be a good human being.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:28.060]   Now presumably, this is actually aimed at an investment-- what do you do about investing?
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:37.580]   And a single word I'd say, minimize costs.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.580]   And start early.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.940]   That's the second piece of advice.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.180]   And never stop your regular investment program, no matter whether times are good or bad.
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.420]   I mentioned low cost.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.180]   Be diversified.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:59.180]   And now I've gone over the single best piece of advice.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.340]   It all counts.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.780]   This is from Dion Stams.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:10.140]   I like the statement that, quote, "In theory, practice and theory are the same.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.700]   But in practice, they are not," end of quote.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:20.020]   Do you have advice for us managing our portfolios on the difference between theory and practice?
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.620]   Well, let me say a couple of things about that.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:32.060]   I read a lot of the Financial Analyst's Journal articles, and a lot of the Journal of Portfolio
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.340]   Management articles.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.980]   And I can understand about 15% to 20% of them.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:45.420]   They've got all these Greek formulas, and they make things very complicated.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.380]   And they're looking backward always.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.740]   So they're doing a lot of data mining.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.420]   If you look backward and see something that doesn't work, throw it in the ash can and
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.940]   find something that does work.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:02.220]   And believe me, if you do enough data mining, you can find a lot of things that work in
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.900]   the past, that have worked in the past, I should say.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:11.980]   So a lot of the theory out there, I think, is cast in a very misleading and foolish light.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.560]   It doesn't allow for cost.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.780]   It doesn't talk about what strategies you should have, what you should do with that.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:26.980]   And there's this backtesting, as it's called, that leaves me dubious about theory.
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   Indeed, I wonder if anybody who writes these academic theory articles has ever followed
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.100]   his own advice.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.380]   Think about that.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:43.660]   And so, practice, I would favor over theory.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.900]   But if you want to tell me that theory, gross return minus cost equals net return, I would
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.900]   follow that.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.900]   Is that a formula?
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.900]   Is that a theory?
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.900]   Is that a practice?
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.940]   It's certainly a practice, and it's certainly a theory, too.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.900]   There's this old saying about, if it works in practice, why the heck doesn't it work
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.900]   in theory?
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:12.420]   An interesting question.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:19.860]   I think there's much too much, much too much, kind of the search for the holy grail in investing,
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:26.020]   the search for the consistently market-beating formula, without the knowledge that, as far
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:30.180]   as I know, in human history, the holy grail does not exist.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.740]   So you don't want to spend an awful lot more time looking for it.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.740]   Okay.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:45.620]   Next, from Nuolf, I put my glasses on, Nuolf Fellenbaum, I'm sorry for the name-pronouncing.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.980]   At what age did you introduce your kids to financial literacy concepts, and what methods
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.620]   did you find most effective?
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.080]   Well, I did it very differently.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:05.220]   First, you can't answer that question very well, because all kids are different, and
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.460]   I'll give you an example of that.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.700]   My oldest son happens to be a hedge fund manager, I mean a market-neutral hedge fund manager.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:21.100]   He does very well for his clients and himself, unbelievably, because his fees are very low.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.220]   He was kind of restless and not fun, and not getting much interest.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.460]   This is when he was, say, 16, and not getting much interest in the world.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.780]   So I said, "Why don't you take a look at the stock market, John, and I'll pick out a couple
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.780]   of stocks for you.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.940]   You can pick out a couple of stocks that you like, and follow them and see what happens.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.140]   We aren't going to buy them, just put them on paper."
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.620]   So he picked out about four stocks, and I didn't know how successful that advice was
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.260]   until I went into his bedroom one evening, and there they were all on little letters
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.020]   on his lampshade.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:15:05.100]   So it was a way to get somebody interested in investing, and I detest these contests
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.420]   that schools and colleges have among kids to see who can pick the best portfolio and
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.620]   all that, because it suggests that that's the way you should invest, but that's just
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   a game.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.100]   It doesn't have anything to do with real investing.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:24.340]   So at what age is a kid able enough, and all children are going to be different, able enough
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.740]   to understand the essential message that I give?
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:37.660]   And I should tell you that for 25 years, so let's use that one, probably the oldest child,
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:46.180]   well, the children probably, they're now in their, well, two of them at their 60th birthday.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:51.100]   God, am I that old?
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:57.300]   So probably when they got into their early 20s, late teens, I told them I was going to
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.860]   put some money away for them every year, and I was going to put it in Vanguard, Balanced
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:08.860]   Index Fund, and that's a, and part of it's an administrative convenience.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:23.980]   You know, I've got six kids, 12 grandchildren, how many great-grandchildren, I guess six
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:30.280]   great-grandchildren, is that right, Mike?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.460]   I told you I relied on Mike for a lot.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:39.220]   And so probably in their late teens or 20s, I told them what I was going to do was put
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.420]   it in a Balanced Index Fund, told them what that meant, wouldn't go up as much as the
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.340]   market, but it wouldn't go down, and you didn't have to worry about it.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.060]   And then every once in a while a news clipping would come along, and I used one of them in
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.780]   my book, Little Book of Common Sense Investing, it showed how well a balanced fund had done,
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.940]   Balanced Index Fund, which isn't very sensational at all, but it had beaten the college endowment
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.540]   funds, I think it's very close to the chart that Gus Sorter showed you a little while
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.820]   ago.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:11.140]   And so I said to Ian, just don't do anything, I put it away, it's in trust, they won't
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.900]   get it for, I guess like work, I can't remember, no, they don't even get it then, then their
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.860]   parents become the trustees, and then they can draw a capital, if they want to buy a
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.020]   new house or something like that, or put a down payment down on it.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:31.860]   But you would be amazed at, I won't give you the numbers, but putting a large kind of gift
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:41.420]   that I can afford to do, every year, year after year, for 25 years, my, these damn kids
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.300]   are rich!
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.020]   And I don't give them valuations, I don't talk about it, I want them to make their own
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:58.340]   way in financial life, and when I cork, they're going to be very, very happy grandchildren,
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:08.460]   but I won't be there to hear the laughter, I guess, I'm not sure.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.240]   Steve Floyd wants to know if the U.S. stock market suddenly went into an unexpected broad
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:22.820]   market decline of greater than 25% and still heading south, what would you tell us to help
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.300]   us stay the course?
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.820]   Well, the first thing I'd say was, who the heck knows whether it's still heading south?
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:38.180]   It may have stopped going down at 25%, and a lot of them do stop at the 20-25% range,
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.780]   but you know, it's an opportunity to buy more, and certainly, you know, there are a lot of
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.580]   funny ways, it's very hard to give advice on these kind of things, but the one piece
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.900]   of advice I would categorically give to everybody, for God's sake, don't stop a program of regular
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:19:00.420]   investing because the market goes down, you're killing the whole value of dollar cost averaging,
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.460]   and it may go down for a few more years, who really knows, but so much the better when
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.620]   you're putting money in every month, because it will come back, I think we're in a little
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:18.380]   dangerous territory now, as I tell people, and 25% drop, 35% drop, it's easily possible,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.500]   it's always possible, just because markets are markets, so I think the questioner is
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:30.420]   right to say, you know, what should I do, and I guess the answer generally is, don't
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.020]   do something, just stand there.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:41.340]   >> This is from Kathleen Ryan, what was the best advice you received from each of your
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.180]   parents?
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:20:02.420]   >> That was a long time ago, you know, I should remember, but I, you know, they always wanted
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:08.140]   me to do what was right, and we placed high value on telling the truth, which would be
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:16.980]   kind of an integrity thing, we were taught to behave like honorable human beings, but
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.620]   I can't remember any specific piece of advice that we got.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.380]   >> Well I would think that everyone in this room and around the world would agree that
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.980]   you've done every one of those things.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.740]   >> I hope so, I try my best.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:41.300]   >> Yvette Sirlucho, again, forgive me on the pronunciation, what are your thoughts on ways
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.820]   a new retiree can protect their portfolio from inflation?
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:55.500]   >> Well, protecting yourself from inflation in the stock market is a very difficult thing,
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.940]   there is very little correlation over, even over intermediate term periods, with stock
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.740]   prices and inflation.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.980]   There is a direct correlation, a very high correlation, between dividend payments and
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:14.060]   inflation, and those lines almost overlap each other, curiously enough, I think I had
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.540]   one of those charts in that ancient Princeton thesis, but dividends are highly correlated,
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:28.180]   and I think we should spend more time thinking about dividends rather than market values,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.900]   because market values are all over the place, and dividends are pretty reliable to go up
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.020]   a little bit each year, like inflation is.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:42.460]   And now, someone mentioned the other day, I think it was Jonathan, maybe, that in 19,
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:51.340]   what was that year, 1979 or 80, dividends went down 22% on the S&P 500, that's an extraordinary
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.340]   event.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:59.260]   It was the biggest decline in dividends since 1929-1933, so it just doesn't happen over
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.260]   and over again.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.100]   And in that case, what was most extraordinary about it, it didn't reflect a general drop
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:10.420]   in dividends, it reflected the elimination of dividends by almost all the banks.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.940]   They had to stop paying their dividends, so I wouldn't give that much credence.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.900]   I think dividends are fairly secure, and you should be worried not about the value of your
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   estate, but about the income-producing capacity of your estate or your retirement plan, because
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.420]   that's where you go out, once a month you go out to the mailbox and get your mutual
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.540]   fund dividends and your Social Security check, and then you come home and have a nice dinner,
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   live in a nice house, whatever else you want to do.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:47.220]   So we should focus, I really believe this so strongly, we should focus more on the inherent
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.420]   value of our investment program than on the market value, because markets are crazy things,
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.580]   and that's what makes investing so difficult, and if you want to look at it that way, so
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.540]   much fun.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:08.020]   This is from John Allen, "I would like to know more about you as an individual.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.740]   What do you like to do that is not related to investing, and what places do you and your
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.420]   family find most enjoyable to visit?"
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:28.540]   Well, I hate those questions, because I'm in fact kind of a jerk, and that is, I have
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:38.340]   gotten so wrapped up in my career and my crusade and my mission that I am not nearly as well-balanced
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.660]   a human being as I should be.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   I try and read three or four good books a year, when someone that has a good education,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.460]   which I certainly got, should be reading a dozen books a year.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:58.740]   I do read the New Yorker, that's my one claim to omniscient, omnibus kind of reading.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.220]   It's a great magazine, greatly written, and great subject matter, you just can't beat
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.220]   it.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.500]   But a few books a year, and I'm talking about good books, I sometimes throw out a junk book.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.140]   I read The Woman in the Window, that popular book a few years ago.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:22.180]   I'm still not quite sure what happened at the end, but of course now I'm not the man
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:27.440]   I used to be, and don't say, "No, you never were."
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.180]   But I can't do much in the way I used to play a lot of tennis, squash, had to pick up golf
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.660]   after I had my first heart attack, which was when I was 31 years old, I guess that was
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.420]   1960, and so I had to give up the racquet sports, and then I finally found a doctor
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.540]   who said, "Get back to racquet sports," which was nice, although it turned out to be something
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.900]   I shouldn't be doing with my peculiar form of heart disease.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:01.180]   I actually collapsed once on a squash court and died, and my opponent didn't know what
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.180]   to do.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.780]   You may have heard this story, ran to the locker room, the guy said, "Call for help,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:13.180]   Mr. Fogel is down, I think he's dead," and the guy said, "Well, yeah, we don't really
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:18.040]   have a system for that."
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:25.620]   And so the guy came back and went, "Clunk, clunk, clunk," that's already good in my
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:30.420]   heart, and that turns out to be quite a brilliant thing to do, particularly in that case, because
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   it actually started.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:41.300]   When the emergency people got there, they said, "Do you think you need to go to a hospital?
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.340]   You can't make this stuff up, right, Mike?"
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:49.980]   And I said, "Yeah, probably a good idea."
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:55.140]   So I can't do the athletic things, I have a lot, you can see it here, I can't do even
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:26:00.020]   much walking now, I'm very shaky in my balance, I'm taking some physical therapy, I hope it
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:05.500]   will get better, but time is not on my side.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:15.340]   But I think my kids would tell you I've been a good father, and you can be a good father
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:22.180]   in my fashion by, I always thought my job was not to lecture the kids, but to show them
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.620]   how I behaved.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:30.620]   So they weren't saying when something happened, "You told us not to do that, daddy."
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.740]   We don't get much of that because I tried to live to the standards that I would have
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.500]   lectured them on.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:42.380]   And so we're close in a lot of ways, children, grandchildren, I'm a very happy, nicest thing
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:48.100]   for a family is to have the cousins all interact together, and we don't do that 100%, we do
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:53.060]   it a very high percentage, we all get together and have great times as a family.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.860]   So I don't feel too guilty.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:03.540]   But the prime reason I was able to be a less than perfect father, I don't know how to explain
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:13.020]   this, but you get consumed with a mission, and you also get a reputation.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:18.640]   And sometimes I think half of my life is spent trying to live up to my reputation, and this
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.780]   I think is not uncommon at all.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:27.200]   It's sort of like Adam Smith's Invisible Spectator, is it Invisible?
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.620]   Impartial Spectator, thank you, I depend on him for everything.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.420]   Impartial Spectator, you read about that in some of my works, and you'll read a little
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.700]   bit about it in my new book.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:45.540]   But I have a fantastic wife, she was a great mother, is a great mother, great grandmother.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:52.160]   She's a complete workhorse, and now she has, she's about five years younger than I am,
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.220]   and now she has the task of taking care of this poor doddering old fool.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.260]   And it's hard for me to get around the house even, so she really steps up to the plate
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.740]   and does that too.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:11.020]   One more task, she's in charge of me and the dogs.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:19.460]   So I don't mean to make this too apologetic, there's an old saying, if you had to do over
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.820]   again would you do it differently?
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.660]   No, why the hell would I do it differently?
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:31.260]   I'm happy with what I've done, in a small way proud of what I've done, and a lot of
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.940]   it's because of people like you in this room.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:43.540]   People have been helped by my simple ideas, and I'd say my high moral values.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.300]   You mentioned your book, there was a question, we're eager to read your new book, is it coming
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.700]   out in November?
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:29:00.620]   I think so, it's really funny, if you can stand a little by play here, Mike has been
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.900]   the lead horse in trying to get all the proofs done and all that.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:13.940]   We got the final proofs and I looked at them over the weekend, a couple of weeks ago, and
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.300]   we only had four days to look at them.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:23.860]   I decided that chapter 17 should not be chapter 17, it should be three different chapters,
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.260]   17, 18 and 19.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:32.180]   So I separated the three, rewrote the third, and brought it in on Monday morning, and I
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.900]   thought Michael was going to faint, and I thought the editor of Wiley was going to die,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.700]   so I turned that over to Mike to deal with it.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:49.540]   It's a better book because of it, but it didn't hold up the publication, the reason I mention
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.540]   it here.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.780]   So it should be out around November 15th, the note on Amazon says November 29th, that's
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:01.420]   a special distribution problem for Amazon.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.340]   I read you that part that I like so much, you, me and the universe, I'm sorry, the universe,
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:16.820]   you and me, no, it was you, me and the universe, got my alphabet wrong, wonder why, so there's
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:27.540]   a lot of moralizing in it, and increasingly I find that life is kind of simple, draw on
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:36.020]   your humanity, try and get the hell out of this world as a decent human being, and you've
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:44.180]   been lucky in your education, in your family, the family that I grew up with and the family
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:50.580]   that I have now, and have also had a career that's amounted to more than nothing.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:56.040]   I don't know, I shouldn't be satisfied, and I will never be totally satisfied, but I feel
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.700]   pretty good about my life so far, so far.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:10.220]   Okay, Bob Ronan wants to know, "Do you think bobbleheads are too thrifty so that they end
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.540]   up leaving too much money for someone else to spend?
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.020]   Should we splurge a little more?"
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.000]   Say that once again, I missed the middle.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.220]   Do you think we end up leaving too much money for someone else to spend?
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.500]   Should we splurge a little bit more?
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:35.100]   Well you asked that question of the cheapest guy in the United States.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:41.680]   I hate shopping, I don't even go into a store, I get most of my stuff, including everything
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:49.100]   I'm wearing at this moment, from L.L. Bean, because they have like a little catalog, and
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.780]   you just check off a few things, or call them by phone, and they send them to you, it's
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   kind of wonderful, and they're not very expensive, but everything, I mean, I give
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.020]   a what, I don't know if I really should say this, but I will tell you it's the truth,
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:13.100]   I might take a couple of families out to dinner, and I get worried about the bill, do you really
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.980]   have to have steak, what's the matter with chicken?
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:22.860]   No, I don't say that, but I think that.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:29.700]   You really need a salad course, you have a nice big dinner, what's this about dessert?
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:36.060]   And yeah, I can give a very large donation to a charity, and not even think about it,
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:41.820]   not even think about it, so that's kind of weird, but it's a lot more fun to give away
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:50.180]   to people that have less than you do, than getting accustomed to a high way of living,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.580]   going out for dinner, for example.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.460]   We like to sort of, although we have this nice place in Lake Placid, very nice, we've
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:04.220]   been there for 50 years now, and bought by my wife's parents, and if I ever say to the
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.420]   kids up there, would you like to go out to dinner tonight, they always say, it's nicer
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:16.080]   than it is here, and we don't go out for dinner, and no place on earth nicer than that.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:23.060]   We also had multiple questions from people out on the Boglehead website that weren't
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:29.400]   able to attend, and I thought I wanted to mix some of those into the questions as well.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:36.180]   Start off with one, what major changes or trends do you foresee coming in the next decade
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.900]   or two?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:46.020]   Well, I'll give you, with reasonable brevity, the three that I write out of the book.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:57.020]   Chapter 17 is now part two, with three chapters, and the part three of the book is called The
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:04.140]   Future of Investment Management, and the three chapters are, number one, the mutualization
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:13.260]   of the mutual fund industry, and there's no way that at some point other firms will adopt
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.620]   the Vanguard shareholder first strategy.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:21.900]   They may not want to, but when costs get driven down and up, when the directors wake up to
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:28.620]   paying huge fees for bad performance, it will finally happen, and I do tell the story in
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.980]   there of my two big attempts to mutualize.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:38.180]   I tried to try to mutualize Putnam, and I tried to mutualize a subsidiary of IBM that
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:44.220]   ran their money, and in both cases, I failed, but on the other hand, you're not out until
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.180]   you have three strikes, and that's only two.
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:53.620]   So I believe that the industry will be forced economically to run itself for the fund shareholders
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.180]   and not for management shareholders.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.740]   That's number one.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:03.420]   Number two is the fight to save the S&P 500 index.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:09.180]   There are all kinds of forces against it, and it's, in a sense, its own worst enemy.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:16.340]   It's so successful that assets are concentrated, and the index funds own very large portions
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:23.260]   of every company in America and pretty much around the world, and for U.S. companies,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:29.580]   Vanguard owns, I think, around 8%, BlackRock owns almost 8%, that's 16, I think I used
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:36.340]   these numbers earlier, and State Street about 4%, just those index funds, and that's 20%,
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:41.620]   and if you throw in American funds, they probably own 3%, and then you go way down from there.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:52.340]   But the concentration of governing power, the first issue is the number of competitors,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:57.380]   like should you own all seven airlines, and a very serious attempt to say that no mutual
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.900]   fund index or otherwise, but it applies mainly to the index fund, can own more than one company
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.900]   in a given industry.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:09.980]   I talked about this briefly the other day, and that is a fight that somebody better be
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.980]   making.
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:19.700]   I'm doing it now myself to say it, because I think by commons agreement, the S&P 500
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:27.220]   index fund that we started in 1975 was the greatest advance for serving investors in
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   the history of finance.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:34.660]   It seems a little broad, but nobody else can think of any other, and so we cannot let that
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:39.860]   go, but there may be things that have to happen, because the other part of the problem, and
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:48.020]   that is concentration of voting power, and there's an article by Dr. John Coates, professor
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:54.180]   of Harvard Law School, who says, "Do we really want a country where 12 people, 12 individuals
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.980]   control the entire corporate America?"
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   I think he's wrong.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:06.220]   It's more like 6 that are going to end up here, not 12, and he says 12 is just a number
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.980]   he picked out of the air, but a very small number of individuals, the chief executives
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.660]   of big money management firms, are going to be able to run corporate America unless something
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.580]   changes.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   Something will change.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.860]   There will be change in governing responsibilities, maybe change in the law.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:32.420]   Right now it says that no mutual fund can own more than 10% of any security, voting
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:38.020]   stock of any company, but it only applies to the mutual fund, not to the complex, so
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:46.900]   it eats the law very easy to get around, which gets me to the third part of the third issue,
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:53.660]   which is what I call in the book the Investment Company, the Financial Institutions Act of
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:38:00.940]   2030, a number picked out of the air, and that is the Investment Company Act is written
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:06.380]   basically to regulate closed-end investment companies, and it doesn't regulate institutional
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.380]   investors.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:13.580]   It regulates mutual funds in incremental ways.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.140]   Mutual funds were never the focus of that act, so they were things that were designed
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.860]   for sort of Procrustean bed, things that were designed for closed-end funds were applied
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   to open-end funds, and it also relates to this litany of problems.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   It relates to a mutual fund.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:37.380]   Well, this isn't a mutual fund, because it was in 1940.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:42.820]   Most people had just one fund, and now people have a lot of funds.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.740]   The regulatory unit should be the mutual fund complex or the management company and not
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.420]   the mutual fund itself, in my opinion, so that will be a big change.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   It's going to happen.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.340]   All these things are going to happen, and I can't tell you why.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:02.700]   I can't tell you how, and I certainly can't tell you when, but I can guarantee you, you
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:08.980]   younger people in the room who will be here to see it, mark my words.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:10.460]   Okay.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.460]   Thank you.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:17.740]   Jack, do you think the market has become more efficient than it was 10 or 20 years ago or
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.180]   less efficient?
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:27.260]   I believe the market is precisely as efficient as it was 70 years ago, and I picked that
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:35.660]   70 years for a reason, and that is I showed the one in my proposal to start an index fund.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.260]   I showed directors that the performance of the average mutual fund, they were all large
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:50.660]   cap funds then compared to the S&P 500, and the mutual fund lost for the S&P 500 won by
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.660]   1.6% a year.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.000]   The article I wrote, which I mentioned to the Financial Analyst Journal about index
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.380]   funds, I brought it up to date to the previous 35 years to 2015 probably, and the gap was
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:13.420]   exactly the same, 1.6 percentage points.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:18.460]   That may be just a happy accident that they're exactly the same number, but it suggests that
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.080]   whatever efficiencies there were then, there are now.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:29.340]   Whatever management ability was able to overcome it now, it's the same as it was then.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:36.540]   There's no evidence that this institutional market of today is much different than the
[00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:42.100]   individual-dominated market of the '30s and '40s and '50s.
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:51.080]   Why would there be a difference when all these institutions are just composed of human beings
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:55.620]   and they want to do better than one another, and whether they're human beings or institutions
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:02.380]   or real human beings, the market is going to be quite efficient, but never perfectly
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.380]   efficient.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:10.500]   This is true for the whole every year of the past 70 years and even before that.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:16.580]   The efficient market hypothesis is right some of the time and wrong some of the time, which
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.540]   I think means it's a lousy hypothesis.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:27.380]   I don't see any evidence that the market is less efficient or more efficient now.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.380]   None.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.820]   Did I make my position clear?
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:38.720]   If you could travel back in time to give some advice to the 21-year-old Jack Bogle, what
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.940]   would it be?
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:51.180]   Get into the mutual fund business as soon as you get out of college.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.100]   Yesterday you mentioned China rising.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.500]   Could you please talk more about this?
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:05.580]   Well, I'm not an expert on China, but what we see out there is continued population growth,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:14.500]   continued substantial GDP growth, which ran up in the 11 or 12 percent annual GDP growth
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.140]   for a while, and now it's down to, I believe, 6 or 7 percent.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.780]   Very healthy growth continually.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.540]   I think those numbers are about right.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:29.940]   I see a more enlightened, in some ways, Chinese government that's prepared to let entrepreneurship
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:34.820]   play its own role, let business play its own role.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.820]   What could get in the way?
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.400]   Those are things.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:44.700]   They basically have a stronger base, economic base, population base, than the U.S., and
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.820]   they will gradually catch up and pass us.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.280]   I don't think there's really any question about that.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:43:01.620]   They have dragging down a tremendous amount of regulation and, what do I want to say,
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.420]   maybe mind control.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:08.900]   You really have to sign on to the Chinese Communist Party if you want to get anywhere,
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:15.020]   one party, and they're giving that a certain amount of continuity by having a leader who,
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:22.100]   I think they suspended the rules, that the leaders change every six years, to give them
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.100]   lifetime.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:30.140]   Then I heard some of them taking it away, so I'm not sure exactly where we are on that.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:36.580]   It's a very regimented society, a very debt-ridden society.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:43.340]   They have big economic issues and a lot of building that goes on with huge debt, and
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.700]   nobody moves into the buildings.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.740]   This is a problem that we face in America from time to time, and it seems to be a serious
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.740]   problem.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:56.700]   Probably the most serious problem is what do we know about China, and that is we don't
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.580]   know a heck of a lot.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.420]   They guard their information.
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:05.900]   They would give you misinformation if they could, and they do give you some misinformation,
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:10.420]   but sooner or later, when you're playing with a half a dozen or a half a hundred different
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   economic indicators, it'll be pretty clear which ones have been fussed with and which
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.620]   ones have not.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:21.260]   So I think they're coming around a little bit, but I think they're powerful potential
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:27.340]   short-term problems and a real risk to world stability.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:36.900]   Do you like Vanguard's target retirement funds, and would you recommend them to most investors
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:40.460]   for their tax-advantaged accounts?
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.540]   Well, take the easy part.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:50.100]   If you want a target date retirement fund, I would lean strongly in favor of Vanguard's.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.100]   Why?
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:55.140]   Because our costs are a fraction -- you knew this was coming -- a fraction of what the
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.860]   others are charging.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.020]   It's a curious paradox.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:09.040]   I believe, and I've said this before and I'll say it again, I believe 40% of the equity
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:16.900]   position outside the U.S. is not the right thing to do, and to do it, I think if you're
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:22.180]   not sure, non-U.S. will do better than U.S.
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   Give people a choice.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.260]   Say we're going to start a whole series of international target date funds.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:31.580]   God knows we've got enough funds already, another 15 or 20 of them won't matter, 12
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:39.620]   of them, I guess, and you decide instead of just saying, "Here's what we're doing," in
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.220]   a notice that nobody read, because people don't read notices.
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:51.380]   That said, we are not particularly out of line compared to the other target date funds.
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:58.500]   T. Rowe Price, American Funds, I guess are the next two competitors, and they have heavy
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   international components.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.460]   I'm not sure it's 40%, maybe a little more, maybe a little less, but we're all following
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.980]   pretty much the same strategy.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:13.360]   What this makes me reflect on is from the very beginning, I thought the best strategy
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:21.060]   for investors and for Vanguard, the firm, was to have funds with relative predictability.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:30.460]   You are never way out of line with your competitors, and you will win on cost if you really are
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.880]   right in line with your competitors.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.900]   If you look at a fund like Windsor and look at other large-cap value funds, say, and this
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:42.500]   is maybe not the best example in the world, you're going to find a 99% correlation between
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:49.980]   our returns, and if you have a 1.5% cost advantage, when you take a lower turnover, lower expense
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.300]   ratio, and no sales load, the 1.5% is easy, it's probably too conservative.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:02.860]   You'll win by 20% over 10 years, probably 20% over 10 years.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:08.660]   If 20% doing 20% better than the average fund isn't good enough for you, I don't know how
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:15.200]   to help you, honestly, and you don't get money pouring in at the top when your performance
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.200]   is great.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.660]   I mean, just think about Magellan, the Magellan Fund, Fidelity Magellan, had this great performance,
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:28.540]   the money poured in, it got to $110 billion, paying the Johnson family a couple of billion
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:29.540]   a year.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.860]   I don't think they need it that badly, but then they do if they're going to cut their
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:41.580]   prices on their index funds to zero, couldn't resist that, and then it stopped doing well,
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:47.000]   and now Magellan Fund is, I think, $9 billion, about right, Mike, $12?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.140]   Okay, let's call it $10 billion.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:56.140]   You could have just said yes.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.880]   You know, Mike is such a treasure, I've got to say that again.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:05.260]   We had such a great time together, and he and I, he takes that in the same sense of
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:14.920]   humor that I offered it out, but that's $100 billion that's left Magellan Fund, probably
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.540]   more than that, because the market has been going up during this period, even though their
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:23.780]   performance has been bad, $100 billion worth of disappointed investors.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:33.240]   No wonder Fidelity is thinking more about indexing, and so the idea of being really
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:41.380]   good must come with the knowledge, certain, that when you're really good in some periods,
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.860]   you're going to be really bad in others.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.040]   That's the way of the markets.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:52.920]   So that's a terrible strategy, because the money comes in, as I said, high, and then
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.940]   when you let the investor down, it goes out, and you've got a dissatisfied investor,
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.380]   and probably a dissatisfied general public who knows your company.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:05.260]   So that has worked out well with index funds, there are other funds that have, I've talked
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.660]   about this before, high relative predictability.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:19.620]   And so, to focus this particular point on Ed's question, is this relative predictability
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:25.820]   for our target date funds relative to our competitors, who all have heavy international
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:30.940]   positions, or is it relative to a simple U.S. stock/bond position?
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.420]   Our investors are going to relate to that.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:40.140]   A lot depends on how international does, international I should say, not U.S., and the fact that
[00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:45.540]   I wouldn't do it, wouldn't have done it, or wouldn't have done it to such extent,
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:57.700]   really means nothing, because I'm often wrong, if never in doubt, just that.
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.500]   And there's also no magic in a target date fund, I mean, it all looks so simple, but
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   it isn't.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:08.580]   There will be periods when you'd be better off having a very high percentage in bonds
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.300]   when you're starting off, and a very high percentage in stocks when you're finishing.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.220]   I mean, that's just the way the market is, you just don't know it.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:21.620]   It's so logical and sensible, and so smart as a way to think about things, but I think
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:27.740]   not maybe, I wonder at the end of the trail, whether the target date fund won't prove to
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:34.300]   have been offered kind of as a panacea, and the investment business, and the mutual fund
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:43.620]   business, there are no panaceas, let me assure you of that, a lifetime of learning, no panaceas.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:49.940]   Okay, the next question is, "What are your proudest accomplishments?"
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:58.260]   Well, I think I said this the other day, quoting Sophocles, did I tell you Sophocles?
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:03.700]   Well, if you don't remember, I guess I didn't tell you, or maybe you weren't paying attention.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.340]   Oh, we were paying attention.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:14.280]   But he said, "One must wait until the evening to enjoy the splendor of the day," and so
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:20.060]   you're asking me, in effect, how do I feel about the splendor of the day, what's my biggest
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.500]   accomplishment?
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:28.860]   But my evening isn't here yet, so I'm going to wait until, I call it a day in this business,
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:36.300]   and I don't know when that will be, I'm going to hang on as long as I can, I will, as you'll
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:41.580]   see in the book, I will keep right on to the end of the road, and though your day be long,
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:49.780]   let your heart be strong, keep right on to the end, if you're tired and weary, still
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:56.260]   carry on till you come to your happy abode, and all you've loved and been waiting for
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:01.420]   will be there at the end of the road, period.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:03.460]   Very nice.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:13.580]   Next question is, "What strategies would you use to avoid the sequence of return risk?"
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:19.620]   There's no way to avoid the sequence of returns.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:26.140]   There is one thing that I would advise everybody, which is at least tangentially related to
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:31.700]   this, and that is when you look at a fund's record, look at this, I mentioned this the
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.480]   other day in connection with the international and the growth in value, put a dollar in the
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:43.220]   fund, and put a dollar in the market, and accumulate those dollars each year, and then
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:49.660]   do a one-into-one chart, so you're not looking at a single unit, like the 10-year, 20-year,
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:54.140]   30-year performance, you're looking at how it was achieved, and if you see this at the
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:58.220]   beginning, you'll see it jump right out at you.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:03.060]   Probably somebody started a fund with $100,000 and put a whole lot of new issues in it, and
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:08.140]   got way ahead and stayed ahead, fell back from that high, but is still way ahead at
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:13.220]   the end of the game.
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:19.780]   The market is going to do what the market does when the market does, and sometimes rationally,
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.220]   and sometimes irrationally.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:27.700]   The reality is, and again, coming back to my idea about dividends, and this is a slightly
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.380]   different one, the market is a terrible thing to think about, because it has this speculative
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.940]   element in it, which means sometimes it's selling too cheap, and sometimes it's selling
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.860]   too dear.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:50.860]   What we do know, know, know, is that ultimately, the return on the stock market, S&P 500, matches
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:56.220]   the fundamental return of the S&P 500, the dividends, yields, plus the earnings growth
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.900]   it has.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:04.380]   Speculation goes, that extra speculation, but you always come back, sooner or later,
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:10.620]   it may take a while, to the fundamental return that is the return created by business, and
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:15.420]   that is dividends and earnings growth.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:20.360]   We can look at the market today and say, "It doesn't look so good," and using that particular
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:28.660]   formula, or that particular concept, you're probably right, but it could be ... I didn't
[00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:34.820]   say when on any of these things, and it could be a few years, I don't think much more than
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:40.300]   that, before the market comes down to its speculative, its fundamental value, but right
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:48.980]   now it's higher, and we know that, but nobody knows when, so you want to be very careful
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.160]   about doing anything about it.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:56.460]   What happens is people look at it now and say it's going to go down to its ... probably
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:02.460]   take about a 25% drop or something, to get to its normalized value, fundamental value,
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:09.740]   value of the earnings and dividends, and someone looks at it, "Well, I'm going to get out now,"
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:17.300]   and then a month passes, and two months passes, and three months pass, and a year, two years,
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:24.020]   and five years, and somewhere along the way the investor says, "I was wrong, so I'm going
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.220]   to go back in."
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:36.020]   That's usually the time to get out, so if someone ... the market is the market.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.020]   It's based on opinions of people who are smart and people who are dumb, of institutions that
[00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:45.660]   were smart and institutions that were dumb, of investors who are lucky and investors who
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:50.820]   are unlucky, and they all come out as a group with the market return, and there's just no
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:57.100]   predicting the sequence that I know of, and if there were, we wouldn't all be gathered
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:58.100]   here.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.180]   There wouldn't be anything to do.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.580]   The answers would be easy, but the answers in the market are never easy, and it's very
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:09.300]   frustrating.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:16.780]   Two-part question, what is the best and worst personal financial decision you've made in
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   your life?
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:25.900]   Well, that's it.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:31.440]   I confess that when I got out of college and started to make a little more than my initial
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:37.300]   pay of $250 a month, and I was able to save a little, I did some investing in individual
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:45.940]   stock, and they all had great stories, and none of them panned out, and when I had a
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:51.500]   little more money, and I'm not talking about big league money here at all, I had a broker,
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:57.260]   a friend of mine from Smith Morning, and he liked to call me up and tell me to get out
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.720]   of this and into that, and it wasn't the fact that every single time I should have got into
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:09.980]   that and out of that, which is the way the world works, but it was the damn phone calls.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:15.040]   I was wasting my time talking to a stockbroker when I had much better things to do in the
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.860]   office yet, so the biggest mistake I was was letting that go on too long, which is probably
[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.300]   10 years.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:31.260]   I do own some equities now, always have, and basically dominated by, I've been director
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:38.620]   of any number of companies, maybe five, and I've gotten option stock from each of those,
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:44.080]   and so I've kept those stocks that I've accumulated there and not sold them, but other than that,
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.700]   I really have very little to do.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:51.860]   I did, let me just full disclosure, being full disclosure, I did, to show my confidence
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:59.340]   in my son's small cap growth fund, I made a pretty decent investment, and it's really
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:09.780]   done well, and I think you could say, Ed, that is it really a mistake?
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:16.980]   A mistake is something you learn from with a small amount of money.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:23.100]   It's probably the most brilliant thing that ever happened to you, so that would be it.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:25.540]   I didn't get the religion adequately.
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:33.460]   Well, the final question that I have, Jack, is would you please run for president?
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:46.860]   There's an old joke about a, it's a Boston joke about a guy's little lisp, and I won't
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:52.780]   bother you with the whole joke, but his answer was, "I won't say yet, and I won't say no,
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:59.780]   but I will say that that's the best over I've had today."
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:05.100]   All right, we can open up to the audience if anybody else has any additional questions.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:11.340]   We've got a few more minutes.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.140]   Hold on until we get a mic back to you.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:22.540]   Jack, thank you so much.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:27.420]   Yesterday we had a great time at Vanguard, and so impressive.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.140]   I think everyone agrees.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:35.220]   Everybody's been talking about it, and the crew members in particular are what make this
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:40.540]   place so impressive, and they talked again and again about how much they love working
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.260]   at Vanguard and how much they love you as the founder.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:49.020]   Could you share, because many of the people here work in business or business leaders,
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:54.300]   how you were able to start that culture that lives on today?
[00:59:54.300 --> 01:00:02.120]   Well, that's really a nice question, because it comes a little bit out of what the events
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:07.820]   that transpired in my book, and that is, I think I started to say this to you yesterday,
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.500]   and it was originally about landmarks.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.420]   Each step along the way that got Vanguard from a little skeleton company, the biggest
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   company in the world.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:23.260]   I never ran 12 of them, and I read the book, and I thought it was a stinking book.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:30.140]   But instead of throwing it away, I added a chapter about human beings, and it's called
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.620]   Caring the Founder's Legacy.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:42.420]   In that I tell the story of when we were probably around, let me just say, 200 crew members.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   We started with 28.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:50.000]   It occurred to me that we should have a personnel function.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.500]   It's called HR today, human relations.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.700]   And we were not about, in those days, oh, no, we're not about to hire anybody.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.820]   We didn't have any money to hire anybody.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:09.820]   So I decided to get an individual in the company to be the head of personnel.
[01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.420]   Her name was Eleanor St. Graft.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.500]   She worked in the legal department.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.420]   I cleared it with her boss, said, "You should do it."
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:24.020]   I came in and said, I tell the story in the book, I say, "Eleanor, we want to start
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.240]   a personnel kind of function.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.140]   Your boss tells me that you would be good at it and could do it, and would you be willing
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   to do that?"
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.140]   "Whatever you want, Mr. Vogel."
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.820]   This was not, in those days, an answer I got with some frequency.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.900]   And I don't get quite that much anymore.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:47.020]   Uh-oh, I shouldn't have said that.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.700]   And so I said, "Well, that's great.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.700]   Thank you."
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.060]   And she goes out the door, and then she comes back in, and she says, "I want to do whatever
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:02.860]   you want me to do, Mr. Vogel, but what is it you want me to do?"
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.820]   And I said, "Well, you know, that's a really good question, and I haven't thought
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.580]   much about what I want you to do.
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.380]   So let me try this.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:15.900]   I want you to hire nice people, and make sure they hire nice people."
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.800]   And out she went and did that.
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:30.420]   So the key is to have people that have at least a touch of niceness, of human goodness,
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.980]   and even more than that.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.140]   And yes, you have to have people with no technology, particularly in today.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:39.980]   That wasn't much at the time, and so you need the technical, which requires very brilliant
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.580]   people.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.100]   But even then, you should try and get people who are at least fun to be around, who are
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:51.300]   committed to the company, committed to their jobs, committed to their fellow crew members.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.180]   You know, it's amazing how many of these people—I mean, I talk to a lot of 25th
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.100]   anniversaries, retirements, Award for Excellence winners.
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:04.540]   I'm still spending a lot of time, which I love, talking to individual crew members
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.940]   or groups of crew members.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.260]   What do we call those things, Mike?
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   I do team meetings.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.260]   Team meetings.
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:17.860]   I do probably three team meetings a week where somebody finds that they want to bring their
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:23.580]   investment team or whatever team it is in to see me, or they get a bigger room and maybe
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.780]   as many as 20 people.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:30.220]   And just I talk to them about anything they want to talk about.
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:40.500]   But I think, to the extent, Patti, that what you're saying is a valid reflection.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:52.220]   I think never underrate the power of trying to be a decent human being.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.220]   And it's really easy.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.540]   You know, don't lord it over people.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.540]   Don't yell at people.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:07.420]   I don't usually—Mike's laughing, I never do, really, almost never, hardly ever.
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:17.420]   And for me, the standard is, really, you build up a reputation for being a decent human being.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:23.060]   There's a lot of admiration, even love, from our crew members.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:30.260]   And we human beings then try to live up to that reputation.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.820]   So it's constantly—I mean, I'm making bigger demands of myself every day because
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.100]   the reputation grows.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:44.860]   But I think it's just trying to be a decent human being who cares about other human beings,
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.940]   whether they're crew members or, for that matter, whether they're all the people sitting
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.820]   here in this room.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.220]   And if you like other people, I'm not a big political guy at all.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.220]   I'm not a big handshaker at all.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.020]   I'm very introverted.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:07.940]   But I enjoy the company of people that share my values, particularly within the company.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:13.380]   And if you can build that kind of a culture—and I never did it, like, consciously.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.640]   I never thought I have to build a culture.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:22.840]   I did what seemed like a natural thing to do, hire people, be nice people, give them
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:27.640]   good compensation, have them figure out what it is to do.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.480]   And a lot of them work on the same teams, have worked on the same teams for 25 years.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:33.480]   And I really like that.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   They get along well.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480]   They come to work.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   They're happy to go to work on Monday.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.920]   And sometimes, even, they had to leave on Friday.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:50.760]   So it comes down to, as human beings, if we want to do what's right for ourselves and
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:57.880]   for society, just try and be good to the people around you and make sure that they pick that
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   up from you.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.800]   It's very easy, because they see what happens.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:08.920]   And have them handle other people, higher or lower in the pecking order, with humility
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.240]   and respect and confidence and trust.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.120]   And you know, I haven't really tried to explain that before, Patty, but that's the
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.040]   best I can do at the moment.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.880]   Can I add something to that?
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   As a firsthand witness, when we had our first conference with Jack in 2000 in Miami, I was
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.840]   a snowbird, and Jack knew that I had a business in this area.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:41.000]   And he invited me to join him when I came back for lunch, which I did.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.880]   And Jack's office is, what, a block or so from the galley.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:55.560]   And as we were walking across from Jack's office to the galley, we had 12,000 employees
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]   at that time.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   Something like that.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.240]   He seems like he knew everyone as we were walking.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.120]   He was approachable.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.680]   He seemed to know their names.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:08.860]   He asked how Mary was, or how Joe was.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:15.880]   And when we got to the galley, there is no executive dining room.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.640]   Absolutely not.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.960]   Jack finds an empty table with all of the other employees and sits there.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:28.920]   And I think that is exactly what we're talking about, what you're talking about, Patty.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.720]   And can I add one little thing?
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.280]   Jack talked about how frugal he was.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:42.120]   In the galley, you go through the buffet, through the line, and you pick out your lunch.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.520]   And we were going to have a salad, and Jack told me to get the lightest plate you could
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.960]   find because they charge by the pound.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.800]   I had to throw that in.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.400]   Tell me this is actually true.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:11.600]   Jack, thanks for everything you've been doing and being such a great man.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.800]   I'm nervous to ask this question to you.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:16.400]   Here's a quote I'm going to have.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:23.600]   You said, "I said, 'Stay the course' a thousand times, and I meant it every time.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.320]   It's the most important single piece of investment wisdom I can give to you."
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.640]   Of course, you've written the book, "Stay the Course."
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:38.520]   But around the year 2000, I think you cut back your equity investments from 70%, 80%
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.640]   to 20%, 30%, something like that.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:48.520]   And you said that in extreme valuations, people should consider similar actions.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.040]   So at that time, the stocks were up 40 times earnings and yielding about 1%, and bond yields
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.840]   were at 7%.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:03.320]   My question is, what measures of extreme valuations should we make to change the course
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.720]   or change our investments?
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.120]   And how am I supposed to know?
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:11.720]   A layman like me, how am I supposed to know that?
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.720]   It's not easy to know.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.160]   Those opportunities don't come along very often.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:23.600]   What happened in 2000 was something I don't know that ever particularly happened before.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.320]   The yield on the stock market cut to 1%, and that's not a sustainable stock market level
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   at 1%.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.460]   Japan got to 1%, Japan got a half to 1%.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:41.700]   But dividend yield is a very important point, a very important point in my reasoning.
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:48.700]   So here we have the stock market looking high, and the yield in the bond market was 7%.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.560]   So that meant you doubled your money in 10 years in bonds.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.000]   And you could double your money or triple your money in stocks from 1%, but it just
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.840]   didn't seem like a good idea.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:08.440]   So I can't remember exactly what I did, but I think I cut back from around 75% in the
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.280]   stock to around 50%.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.680]   Very unusual, something I would probably advise people not to do.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:26.400]   It worked well, of course, and I don't want to get too much sentiment into this, but don't
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:33.040]   forget I had gone through little bits of hell, health-wise, and my heart was not working
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.040]   well.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:43.120]   I wanted to make sure that if I departed this orb that my portfolio was fairly conservative
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.040]   for my family.
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:52.920]   And so I even, I was having an ablation, which is a long process where they run stuff into
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.380]   your heart to try and get it beating properly.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.280]   It took 10 hours.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.520]   Before I called my lawyer from the operating room and said, "Could you please get down
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.520]   to me?
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.360]   You never sent me the things I should sign to change my will the way I did the other
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:12.180]   day, and I want to sign them before I get this procedure done."
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:19.760]   So down she came, and I signed them, and so there is the subtle pressure of an uncertain
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:29.720]   life that has dictated more of my investment changes than you might think.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.280]   And that's probably stupid, but it is understandable, because you're thinking about those that are
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.280]   coming behind you.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.740]   Anybody else?
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.200]   While we wait, as I walk over there, I'll tell you a story I haven't told everybody
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.200]   here before.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.220]   An airline pilot flying from one place to another, I don't know where it was, Florida,
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.220]   got off the trip.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.620]   The flight attendant is, "We're organizing everybody to get on the van to go somewhere."
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:02.760]   And he goes, "Yeah, some guy was in a coach seat, was sitting in the back of the galley,
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.460]   and he was giving me investment advice."
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.900]   And I said, "Oh, no, it's a stockbroker, insurance salesman, or somebody like that."
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.620]   He says, "Yeah, give me his card."
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.860]   And he pulled it out, and it said, "John C. Boll on it."
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:21.460]   So I'm thinking about, now, how do I get that card, or should I tell him who it is?
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.920]   So anyway, I said, "Hey, if you don't want that card, you know, I'll go ahead and take
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   it."
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.920]   And I took it, and then I told him who it was.
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:30.300]   But on the back of it was life strategy, moderate growth.
[01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.540]   He was advising a flight attendant in the back of the airplane.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.340]   So that's a story I've never told that here before.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:39.780]   That's probably what we call apocryphal.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.500]   - Jack, I have a question for you.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.580]   All of us have been following your mission.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.060]   We've been trying to get it out to more and more people.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.460]   We've been following it ourselves.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.860]   Are we doing the right thing?
[01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:02.060]   Is this what you want us to do as Bogleheads?
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:07.660]   If you could elaborate to all of us, if you were going to give us a mission, what would
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   it be?
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:17.200]   - Well, you know, that's a hard question to answer, because I think it's unwise for anyone
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:24.620]   here, including me, to give anybody real advice, because we don't know what's going to happen.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:32.460]   And you're judging the questioner, the person asking the question or asking the advice.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:36.260]   You don't understand who that person is, how could you possibly do that?
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:41.020]   So I like the idea of the Bogleheads Forum, where all ideas can be integrated and people
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:43.420]   that disagree can do this and that.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:49.620]   So I think it's participating in a group exercise, and I must say I'm astonished and delighted
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:53.880]   with the success of the Bogleheads website, and investors love it.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.700]   They love Taylor's book, and they love my books, too, which are pretty much the same
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.100]   as Taylor's, except longer.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:11.180]   And so I think your mission is to do what's right for yourself, and if someone comes to
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:17.620]   you in need, just give them a course that goes down the middle with the knowledge, knowledge,
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:22.540]   always the knowledge certain, that you don't know what--nobody knows what lies ahead.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:30.740]   What worries me about this 25-year, 45-year bull market, which Vanguard has existed, 12%
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740]   return.
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:40.260]   It's not going to happen again, I don't believe, and I think there's too much--too many people
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:45.700]   believe that the past is prologue, the future will continue to get these high returns.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:51.080]   But think about that chart I showed you yesterday, showing the difference between a 4% return
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:58.300]   on stocks and a 12% return, where your money doubles in the 12% return every six years
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:04.380]   and a 4% return every 18 years, and look at those lines spread apart.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.540]   Don't expect it to happen again.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:16.180]   Underplay, always underplay, the chance to make big money.
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:21.860]   Investing is a matter of putting to work money with corporations, and I have a lot of worries
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.340]   about our corporations today.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.500]   So I say this advisedly, I just don't know what else to do.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:33.700]   I worry about the merger trend somebody has, about the shrinkage of companies in the U.S.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:39.140]   Bill Bernstein did yesterday, and that's a serious problem, not a major serious problem,
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.540]   but a serious problem.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.460]   And so the future is always uncertain.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.060]   So whatever you--I guess I would like to sum up by saying, whatever you say to anybody
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:57.420]   about anything at any time, just make sure to say, "But nobody really knows," or "Investing
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:04.820]   is really a hard business," because our emotions get mixed up with our reality, with our mathematics,
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:13.420]   the dollars we have in our retirement plans, and I think you should not be quite blunt
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   about it.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:19.580]   Try to give investment advice to anybody else without those hedging words.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:27.780]   - Okay, here's a chance to talk to your financial hero, or a financial hero--let me make my
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   way to the front.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:49.180]   - First, I wanted to thank Mike for being such a great help to Jack and to all of us.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:57.260]   - Jack, you mentioned that you read a couple good books a year.
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:01.620]   Which of the recent good books would you recommend to us?
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:10.220]   - Well, I'm right in the middle of a biography of Andrew Jackson by John Meacham called American
[01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:21.260]   Lion, and I don't get a chance to catch up with it very long.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:27.500]   And the last really great book I read was--I'm not talking about the last book, the last
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:34.020]   really sensational book--was Doris Kearns Goodwin's Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.860]   Taft, and the New Age of Journalism.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:43.040]   And it's a compelling book, but particularly--a little disclaimer here--particularly for me,
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.620]   because I studied and wrote a paper about the New Age of Journalism back at the turn
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   of the century.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:53.740]   Ida Tarbell, and I can't remember the name of the magazine that printed all this stuff.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:18:00.020]   But journalism was active then, and people listened to journalism then.
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.140]   And they had a powerful role in the public.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:10.100]   And so that combination of two really interesting characters--I mean, there's nobody more interesting,
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:15.620]   I don't think, than Theodore Roosevelt--just meant for a very compelling read.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.580]   And I like biographies, but I wouldn't know where to begin.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:29.380]   And people send me books all the time, investment books, and I'm asked to endorse them.
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.300]   And I got one the other day, and I decided I'd give it a shot.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.980]   I won't mention the name of the author.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:42.020]   And I got to about page 150, and it was 550 pages.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.860]   So I wrote back to him and told him my rule.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.740]   I never endorse a book without reading it.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.020]   And I was sorry.
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:50.900]   He just wrote too big a book for me to read.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.260]   He didn't seem very happy.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:58.740]   I also warned him, by the way, that my endorsement has never been known--my blurb--has never
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:05.940]   been known to add a single copy of Extra Sales, not one book, ever.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:12.380]   >> Got one on the other side.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:16.940]   And also on the personal touch, after we finished the conference last year, I got home and received
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.460]   a note from Jack himself.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.460]   Very impressive.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.260]   You talk about the personal touch.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:27.660]   Jack, we know how much you enjoy eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:32.540]   And other than whatever's on sale, what is your favorite kind of jelly?
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.380]   >> Grape.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:43.620]   >> Well, I think that wraps up the Q&A.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:48.300]   On that note, is Jason going to put that in the journal?
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.300]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.300]   >> Okay.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.300]   Thanks.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:57.860]   >> I was just going to ask you, Jack, as a new father, and with our second child on
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:04.380]   the way, my wife graciously allowed us to call him Jack, call him Little Jack.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.300]   This is Big Jack, as he's referred to.
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:13.660]   But I just wanted to ask if you could give us a little advice on--especially as a father,
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:18.140]   but you had six kids of your own, and you elaborated the relationship that you have
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:19.140]   with them.
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:22.780]   That's not something that happens by accident.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:24.740]   You have to be an intentional parent.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.780]   And you don't really see that in society, but in talking with many of you as a first-time
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:34.140]   attendee, that's something that's pervasive, and my compliments to all of you and to you,
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.140]   Jack.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:45.900]   But if you could just give the next generation of parents your advice, and what worked for
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.740]   you in developing that relationship with your kids?
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:54.420]   >> Well, I've already told you I was an imperfect parent, so I don't know that I'm a good person
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   to answer that.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:04.220]   I mean, I'd say, as I do in so many ways, the simple things that matter, Ben.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:08.940]   First, love the child, no matter good or bad.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.940]   Two, set an example.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:15.220]   Don't have to explain yourself away.
[01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:22.460]   Three, be prepared for some real bumps along the way, because almost every child has them,
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.580]   particularly as teenagers.
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:32.140]   And four, when it comes to time to drive a car, don't let them.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:41.420]   >> Well, Jack, the Bogo Heads appreciate your--every year, attending and being and sharing your
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:45.140]   time with us, we cherish your friendship.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:50.620]   Every year, we look for some meaningful gift to commemorate your appearance here.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   And it gets tougher and tougher.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.860]   I know you don't have any room.
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:22:01.620]   Just to tell the tale, when I was in Jack's office a few years ago, he had honorary doctorate
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:06.180]   degrees on the floor, so I know you don't have a lot of room.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:14.280]   But this year, from the American Revolutionary War Museum, I think we found something that's
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.980]   meaningful and small.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:24.060]   This is a letter opener in the shape of an American Revolutionary War sword.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:30.980]   And the inscription reads, "To Jack Bogo, who revolutionized the mutual fund industry
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:37.620]   by slashing costs, saving investors billions, the 2018 Bogo Heads Conference."
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:44.620]   [ Applause ]
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:23:11.940]   >> Thank you all.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:17.300]   You make me happier than ever that I was able to make it and be with you today.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:25.700]   And the one thing I want to say, of course, it's a highlight of all your admiration and
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:33.460]   good words and good wishes and selfies and signed books and standing ovations.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.900]   All that means a tremendous amount to me.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:40.220]   But what means the most to me, at least it's on my mind now, is one of you came up to me
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.580]   and said, I think one of the visitors for the first time, "What a wonderful group of
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.220]   human beings you are."
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:52.940]   They came here, they felt comfortable, they felt welcomed, they felt part of the group,
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:57.860]   they felt there was an openness, everybody was treated as equals.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:05.420]   And I think that is an incredible tribute to all of you in this Bogo Heads crowd.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.100]   And that's what really life is all about.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:15.220]   So it's a wonderful moment I'm looking out there and thinking, wow, what a nice group.
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.620]   So until next year, God bless you all.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:39.620]   [Applause]
