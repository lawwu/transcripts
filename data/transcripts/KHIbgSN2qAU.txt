[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.120]   Welcome to this 10-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.720]   Non-sleep deep rest is a powerful tool that can allow you to control the relaxation state
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   of your nervous system and your overall state of mind.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.600]   It can restore mental and physical vigor, and it can be done any time of day or night.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.360]   It's very simple to do.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.080]   You'll want to do this protocol seated or lying down.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.440]   So if you're not already seated or lying down, please do so now.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.300]   You'll also want to close your eyes.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.400]   So if your eyes aren't already closed, please close them now.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:00.200]   Throughout this protocol, you'll want to breathe normally, unless instructed to do otherwise.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.660]   One pattern of breathing you'll be asked to do is to inhale deeply, ideally through your
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.080]   nose.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.560]   But if you can't do it through your nose, inhale through your mouth.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200]   Try that now.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.920]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale all of your air through your mouth.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.160]   Let's do that again.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.960]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through your mouth.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   And as you exhale, exhale through thinly pursed lips, as if through a small straw.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.640]   Let's repeat that two more times.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:02:00.300]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.320]   One more time.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.280]   Inhale deeply through your nose, and then exhale completely through your mouth through
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.760]   thinly pursed lips.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.400]   Breathing in that way, that is, inhaling deeply through your nose, and then exhaling completely
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.920]   through the mouth through thinly pursed lips, is known to slow your heart rate down and
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.520]   relax your nervous system.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.760]   Feel free now to simply breathe normally.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.080]   Now in your mind's eye, imagine yourself standing over yourself, looking at your body, which
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.360]   is seated or lying down, and imagine holding a flashlight or a spotlight and directing
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   it at your feet.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.000]   Focus your attention on whatever it is that your feet happen to be in contact with.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.520]   It could be socks, sandals, shoes, or merely the air.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.600]   Focus your attention specifically on the bottoms of your feet and try to perceive whatever
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.480]   it is they are sensing.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.280]   They could be tingling, they could even be numb.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:49.560]   Now imagine expanding that spotlight to include the tops of your feet, your shins, your calves.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.280]   Expanding that spotlight further to include your thighs, your hamstrings, and up to your
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880]   waist.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.240]   Now, with your entire lower body illuminated inside the beam of light from that spotlight,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:17.460]   inhale deeply through your nose or through your mouth, and then exhale completely through
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:28.600]   thinly pursed lips until your lungs are empty.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.560]   Repeat that twice more, and each time as you exhale, imagine your lower body sinking down
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:58.900]   about a centimeter into whatever surface you happen to be in contact with now.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.380]   Now move the spotlight to your abdomen and focus your attention on whatever it is your
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.300]   abdomen is sensing.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.660]   As you inhale, your stomach should move out slightly, and as you exhale, it should sink
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.300]   down.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.620]   Expand the spotlight to include your upper abdomen, your chest, your neck.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:41.660]   And now in your mind's eye, imagine that spotlight is expanding to include your arms as well.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.580]   Continue to breathe normally.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.660]   Now focus your perception on whatever surface your back happens to be in contact with.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:58.420]   A shirt, a chair, a sofa, whatever surface it happens to be contacting.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.180]   Focus on that contact now.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.460]   Simply bring your attention and your perception to those points of contact.
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:20.780]   And as you do so, inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.860]   And then as you exhale, imagine your back and your upper body sinking about a centimeter
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.260]   into whatever surface they happen to be in contact with.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.540]   Now move the spotlight to include your face, the top of your head, and the back of your
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.420]   head.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.660]   And as you continue to breathe normally, focus your perception on relaxing the muscles of
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:53.300]   your face.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.620]   And as you continue to breathe normally, see if you can extend the duration of your exhales
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.700]   ever so slightly.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:12.600]   And now in your mind's eye, expand the spotlight downward to include your neck, your chest,
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:29.420]   your arms, your abdomen, your waist, your legs, and down to your feet.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.360]   Imagine yourself looking down at your own body illuminated inside of the spotlight.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.000]   And in your mind's eye, deliberately dim that spotlight.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.480]   Make the illumination less intense.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.640]   Inhale deeply again through your nose or through your mouth.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.760]   And then exhale completely through thinly pursed lips.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:11.620]   And as you do so, imagine your entire body sinking into the surface it's in contact with.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:21.400]   Now while continuing to breathe normally, move your toes ever so slightly.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.380]   In doing so, you'll notice that you are in control of your nervous system, meaning you
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:33.120]   direct your perceptions and your actions.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:41.160]   Move your ankles and bend your knees just the slightest bit.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   You can move your upper body from side to side, your head from side to side, or even
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.160]   nod just slightly.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:03.800]   Now move your hands, lift your arms just a tiny bit, then set them down again.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:10.720]   And now, whenever you are ready, slowly open your eyes.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.640]   And as you do so, you'll notice that normally your nervous system is bombarded with sensory
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:24.680]   information, mostly visual information, which you have eliminated during this non-sleep
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.300]   deep rest protocol.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.640]   As you have now experienced, you are in control of your perceptions.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:39.880]   Controlling your perceptions is simply directing your attention to specific sensations, and
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:46.280]   you control which sensations you perceive by directing your attentional spotlight to
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.920]   whatever part or parts of your body that you choose.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.400]   Non-sleep deep rest protocols, such as this one, can help you restore your sense of mental
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:06.840]   and physical vigor, can partially offset the effects of not getting enough sleep, and can
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.400]   also help you get better at falling and staying asleep.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:21.160]   It can be done any time of day or night, when you feel you need a mental and/or physical
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   reset.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   Thank you for joining me for this non-sleep deep rest protocol, brought to you by Huberman
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.640]   Lab and AG1.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.640]   [silence]
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
