[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.320]   - Gecko Robotics builds wall-climbing robots
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.240]   and enterprise software to maintain
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.560]   and protect essential infrastructure.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.040]   - He is the CEO and co-founder at Gecko Robotics.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   Jake, thanks for joining me today.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.080]   - Every hour you save,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.920]   you're saving potentially millions of dollars.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.480]   - Hardware is hard.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.680]   - Be very careful.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.960]   - There's a lot of really important problems to solve.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320]   - There's so much sex appeal to building new things,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.800]   but you gotta get the business model right.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.040]   - The business model has to make a CEO or CFO give up.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.360]   - There's a huge fire going on right now
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.440]   at Philadelphia Energy Solutions.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.760]   Oh my gosh, again, look at this guys.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.800]   Look at this video right now.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.440]   - Today, the Navy remains a formidable fighting force,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.560]   but even officers within the service
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.960]   have questioned its readiness.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.160]   - At a missile silo we visited,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.760]   time and frigid weather had clearly taken their toll.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.200]   - Developing right now, gushing for hours
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   with no end in sight,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.720]   thousands of barrels of crude oil spilling from a tank.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.840]   - The report does an estimate of what the need is
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.440]   to bring the overall grade up to a B,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440]   which is what the society sort of determines to be adequate.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.800]   And it's like 4.59 trillion dollars.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.280]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.480]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   - Bye, bye.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.440]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.160]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.000]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.880]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.000]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.120]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.880]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.000]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.280]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.440]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.440]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.440]   - We'll see you next time.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.360]   - Hi, I'm Jake, the founder and CEO of Gecko Robotics,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.080]   a company that makes robots and software
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   to help diagnose the health of the built world.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.200]   Now, it started in a college dorm, my college dorm,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.000]   is now a company that manages over 500,000
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.240]   of the world's most important
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.920]   and critical pieces of infrastructure.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.440]   Now, the structures that we use to power civilization
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.720]   have reached their useful life.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.600]   It's a huge problem and it's getting way worse.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960]   But it's a problem that you probably don't think about very much,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   but you should.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.840]   In New York, for example, there are over 17,000 bridges,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   most of which are in New York City.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.800]   And guess how many of those bridges are not in need
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.640]   of immediate repairs?
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.800]   Only six.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   See, maintaining things has always been an afterthought.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.680]   But that afterthought is now a $4.59 trillion domestic problem.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.800]   And by the way, it's getting worse.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   It's holding us back.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.120]   For example, the military spends 40% of their budget, over $400 billion on maintenance.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.920]   Not on building new things, just keeping old things working.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   And Fortune 500 companies will lose $1.5 trillion every single year
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.080]   because of catastrophic failures that were unpredictable.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.360]   And our best defense to stop that from happening hasn't changed in over 60 years.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.280]   It's this.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.280]   This is Joe.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.360]   And Joe's on a rope.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.800]   Now, Joe's armed with a handheld sensor and what looks like an excruciating wedgie.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.560]   Now, Joe's our best chance to ensure that pipelines don't explode,
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.600]   that bridges don't collapse, that dams don't fail,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.760]   and that airplanes don't disassemble mid-flight.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.040]   It's an impossible job, unfortunately, for Joe.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.120]   You see, we obsess about how software has changed everything for everyone.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.880]   It's eating the world, right?
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.640]   It's important to remember that for the guys behind me,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.040]   it's actually never helped them.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.200]   You see, the data that we need to prevent catastrophes from happening
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.920]   in the built world simply doesn't exist.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   And without data, what can software do?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.200]   Now, I became obsessed with this problem in college.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.720]   I was studying electrical engineering,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.560]   and my obsession for energy took me to a local power plant in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480]   I wanted to see how power was made.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.160]   And so, I decided to dive in head first.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.080]   No, I actually dove in head first straight through this hole.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.520]   And when you got through this hole, you got into a 200-foot-tall steel-tubed box,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.360]   the length and the width of a football field.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   This is a power plant boiler.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.960]   And the boiler's job was to turn water into steam by getting really hot.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.240]   See, the problem is, as the plant manager, Jeff, told me, that 40% of the time,
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   this boiler would be shut down because of pressure tube explosions.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.440]   It would cost them $2 million every single day they were down.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.960]   This is a small little power plant.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.720]   And so, I asked Jeff, "How do you stop this from happening?"
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.280]   And he says, "Well, we send up humans on ropes looking for invisible defects."
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.080]   And then he began to tear up.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.400]   And he told me a story about how his best friend fell and died the year before
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.160]   doing one of these inspections.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   And he fell and died in the exact spot I was standing.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.920]   So, I was floored by the story.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.800]   And so, I had to do something about it.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.120]   So, I went back to my college dorm and started building the first wall cleaning robot.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.920]   And I armed this robot with ultrasonic sensors, just like doctors use for sonograms.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.960]   And I deployed that robot into the boiler, saving the plant manager, Jeff,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.880]   30 million dollars just that year.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.840]   And I became absolutely obsessed with how we understand the health
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.000]   of the built structures that we use every single day.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.680]   That's why I started a company.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.280]   And I boot shopped that company for three years, pouring my life savings into it.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.440]   I slept on my best friend's apartment floor.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   And I was down to the last hundred dollars.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.480]   Two things happened within two weeks.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.200]   First, I got an offer to buy the company from a company that makes power plants.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.240]   And then second, two partners from a group called Y Combinator said that if I stayed poor
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.040]   and kept on building the vision, that one day Gecko would change everything that we knew about built
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   structures.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.800]   So, I decided to stay poor and keep building the vision.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.680]   And so, we launched the company in 2016.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.840]   And we began to deploy the technology into the oil and gas, manufacturing, public infrastructure,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.960]   and even defense sectors.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.120]   We had to build robots that could climb and traverse and get sensors into all different kinds of surfaces,
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.640]   geometries, conditions.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.160]   And once you have 500,000 assets that you have to climb around, you begin to iterate your robots really,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.800]   really well to be able to handle these kinds of environments.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.280]   And it became clear that contrary to popular belief from the VCs at the time, the robots were the
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.360]   mode because they could get sensors to places that could never be gotten to before.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.840]   We could convert atoms into bits.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.720]   And so, I wanted to double down on that mode.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.560]   And so, we started building robots that could fly, swim, crawl, and walk up any surface.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.160]   We began to build autonomous platforms to arm those robots to be able to go to places so that
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.080]   humans didn't have to be in dangerous environments.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.720]   We built and became the best in the world at building ultrasonic sensors,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.840]   electromagnetic sensors, as well as lasers to be able to see and understand what was going on
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.760]   inside of steels, composites, and concrete.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.880]   We built fixed sensors that could stream live information and data sets to us, both the health,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   but also the operational conditions of those assets itself.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   And we built an API platform for robots called Fulcrum so that other robotic companies could
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.880]   actually be used on our platform in streaming data and information live to our customers.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.480]   And after 10 years of collecting data on almost every structure imaginable, we launched cantilever.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.360]   Our AI and robotics powered operating platform to put those data layers to use for our customers.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.800]   You see, when you start building software by first starting out with the data layers and then
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.000]   building up, you're severely advantaged because you can build software from first principles.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   And our ontology now is able to affect folks from the ground level, the guys on the ropes,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   all the way through to the executive suite.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   It was extremely powerful.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.040]   But I was just talking about it.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.960]   Let's actually dive into an example.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.120]   So to do that, I'm going to take you to Georgia,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.680]   to a manufacturing facility that me and you use in the bathroom every single day.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.520]   Now this facility has thousands of assets and billions of dollars worth of infrastructure.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.840]   And so they wanted us to prove out over 50 assets, what we could actually do.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.000]   So I'm going to take you through one of those assets today, a sulfuric acid tank.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.400]   So first, what we do is we gather information about the asset by customers sending us their metadata.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:16.000]   And we build out a digital representation of that asset inside of cantilever.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.080]   And then we send in our robots.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.000]   First, we use a drone.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   You can see over here.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.400]   Now the drone is armed with cameras that are doing a photogrammetric scan of the asset.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.720]   It enriches the asset model itself.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.840]   Being able to identify different kinds of defects using point clouds.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   So corrosion areas like over here, we're able to categorize and locate.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.480]   And then dents and cracks as well, enriching the data asset model.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.320]   We want to go further than that.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   We incorporate other sorts of components like piping and pumps that you see here,
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.520]   both in the inlet and outlet.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.480]   This is extremely important and valuable because we keep on adding data layers.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.960]   And the next one is a dog.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.680]   Come here, boy.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Good dog.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.920]   Hey.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.200]   Everyone say hi, please.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.560]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:08.880]   Nice.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   So let me pet him real quick.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.600]   He likes to be pet.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.320]   Yeah, good boy.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.800]   So this dog will walk around to dangerous environments,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   gathering information about what's going on on the infrastructure.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.800]   Now, what's important also to understand is that because of an API platform for robots,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.440]   we've built an extensible way for a company like Anybotics, one of our partners,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.520]   to be able to gather information and data sets.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.440]   And this robot is extremely exciting because it's built to be explosion proof,
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.680]   meaning it can go inside of oil and gas facilities and nuclear facilities and beyond.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.520]   It's gathering information like you see above, thermal imaging, to understand what's going on with the asset.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.640]   All this data is really important when we do optimizations later.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.120]   And we want to begin to continue to gather more information about the asset.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.200]   So we send in submersible robots.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.160]   These submersible robots are looking at the deformation because of the weight of the liquid,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:06.880]   as well as the health of the asset's floor, to prevent things like that oil tank or leaking into rivers.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.480]   And once we've gotten this, and the customer is really excited because we can do this while they're online,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.760]   we then send in our robots and we rise,
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.240]   collecting information and data while the customer's tanks are still in operation.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.680]   Now these robots that you see right here are armed with ultrasonic sensors,
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.120]   cameras, and the IMU on board to ensure that we can do this autonomously,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.720]   gathering terabytes of data in 12 hours for this tank, a process that used to take about a month
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.360]   to do while the asset was shut down, costing millions of dollars.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.720]   And we can do this in a way as well that ensures that we can localize data points to begin to run
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   optimizations. And in this case, because these assets are supposed to be reaching their useful life
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.080]   or reached it, we can extend the useful life of the infrastructure. And so for this example,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.840]   we can tell them what to fix in five and ten years to extend the useful life so that this asset
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.360]   continues to be able to do its function, opposed to having to replace it for eight million dollars,
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   which was what the plant thought they would have to do. So once we do that predictive model,
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.120]   we work with maintenance companies to ensure that they actually take action on that,
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.320]   and we update the model to ensure that a source of truth remains.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.840]   Next, the customer actually wants us to begin to do other optimizations, so we use fixed sensors like
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:31.120]   this that'll stream information about not just the health, but also the operating condition of the
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.560]   facility. You see, when you're running a, let's say, a big manufacturing facility, your goal is to
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.840]   figure out how to make more product without having stuff blow up because of a new operating condition.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.560]   Now that's never before been possible because the data you've been able to work with has been from
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.520]   Joe on a rope. And so you don't know if you change your throughput or make more product, if that'll destroy the
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   assets, we're able to run optimizations. Now I'm going to show you that here. So this customer was able to,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.560]   because we're streaming information and data from the pumps and from the asset itself, we were able to
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.960]   figure out how to increase the throughput or make more product by about five percent more while only
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:17.760]   having to incur over 90 days an accelerated damage of the asset of about two months, equivalent to two
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.200]   months. And so we've proved that we could do that by actually lowering the fill heights in the tank and
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   increasing the asset concentration level. You can see the optimization being run right behind me.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.520]   Now this was significant because of the ability to not just extend the useful life, but actually
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.960]   produce more while not having the potential risk of a catastrophic failure, something never before
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:44.000]   possible for these companies. Now let's talk about the outcomes for the customer. On average, over the
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.040]   50 assets, we extended the useful life by 10 years. This affects their P and L and their margin right away
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:55.840]   because of ability to extend your depreciation models. And then we created $105 million of value by being
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.120]   able to reduce safety risks as well as environmental, as well as being able to reduce the amount of capex
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.440]   the customers needed to spend. And the estimated from the customer was a four percent impact to their margin.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.960]   Now all of this optimization and information coming in doesn't just help the customer, it also helps
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:17.680]   cantilever be exceptional in a compounding way at running facilities more efficiently. And so now you
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.040]   have an ability to have an unfair advantage from companies that are not utilizing technology like this.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.360]   So not just are robots cool, but they're actually solving a business problem.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.640]   So this has been flying off the shelf, as you can imagine, since we launched cantilever
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.000]   this year. The 12th largest oil and gas company in the world, for example, determined that they have
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.480]   100,000 tanks and that we could provide $122,000 of ROI per tank. Now initially we signed a $30 million
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   contract, it's exciting, it's going to extend to $100 million, but it shows how if you adopt technology
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:59.760]   in a way like this, it's unfair. Now on the defense side, we're working with the Air Force on $130
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   billion modernization program. Now they have to modernize over 400 nuclear missile silos,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.120]   and the best way to determine how to modernize or what the scope was to improve the missile silos
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.640]   was, I kid you not, Joe on a rope with a hammer, who was listening to the sound that the silos made
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.880]   when he hit it. So now Gecko is helping to improve what the modernization scope actually should be,
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.680]   and it points out something interesting. Those that are determining the scope and size
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.040]   of these modernization projects are the same ones incentivized for that amount of dollars to be
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:41.120]   as high as it can be. Now on the Navy side, one of the biggest problems is only a third of our ships
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.480]   are available to patrol and deter conflict around the world, and the reason why is because of maintenance
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:54.400]   cycles. So we worked with the Navy to improve, in this case it was Joe on a skateboard on his belly,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.000]   over a flight deck looking at different areas trying to gather information and data sets. We improved
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.800]   that to be able to reduce labor by 85 percent and improve the turnaround times for flight decks alone
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.280]   by about a month. So now we're doing tens of millions with the Navy on flight decks and we're extending that
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.360]   to ballast tanks, hulls, as well as commercial maritime. It's really exciting. And then on the energy
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.120]   and manufacturing sector that's where most of our seven to eight-year accounts lie with big contracts
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:27.280]   like Exxon, BP and beyond. Now one thing that's extremely exciting is that it turns out if pipelines
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:35.360]   explode or when oil leaks into rivers it's pretty bad for the environment. So the studies show that by
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.560]   2030 in the U.S. you can reduce emissions by about 18 percent if you can stop those kind of things from
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:49.200]   happening. So technology is available today to make a drastic impact on net zero. And then it turns out
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.600]   as well if you're the best in the world of understanding the health of built structures you're actually very
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.920]   advantaged in building new things and so that's what the admiral in charge of 132 billion dollar nuclear
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.120]   submarine project called the Columbia class determined. So now we're helping to create the most advanced
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.160]   submarine in the world from the beginning to the production end. And it gives you a peek into what's coming.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:22.320]   You see, I'm not crazy. Building robotics, material science, AI, software, sensor company, it's really
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:30.480]   freaking hard. But I had no choice. You see, the promise of AI from AI companies to make impacts in
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   these industries have gone empty for years and years and years. And it's no wonder why. They're building their
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:48.240]   foundational models off of Joe's data. Data that looks like this. This is a real report from one of our
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   customers before they used Gecko. It's no wonder that AI hasn't made the impact of the promise that it was
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:02.640]   supposed to. So this is why we built Gecko and why I believe because of software being commoditized that
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.040]   first-order data companies will dominate the next 10 and 20 years in software. And my journey through
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.240]   the rust has given me both a pragmatism and optimism about the future. A future where understanding how
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:22.160]   things work helps you build new things. Understanding how to use AI and robotics in these real practical
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:29.040]   ways. A reality where we can understand the health of the built structures all around us just as well as we
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   understand our own health. And you begin to see robots, of course, in normal society. But these robots
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:44.240]   won't be built for doing backflips or folding laundry. They're going to be built to help realize the impact
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.880]   of AI for the built world with systems like cantilever. Thank you.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:04.880]   David Sachs showed up, everybody. Doggy. Hey. Sachs, that's a robotic dog.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.520]   How's your coffee? Your kind of dog. Oh.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.720]   Go to Sachs. Go to Sachs. Go give him a kiss.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.920]   Oh, there we go. Sachs is very affectionate. You can pet him if you want, David. You can pet him, Sachs.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Here. Where do you pet him exactly? There you go.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   That was a lot of love. Yeah. I am experiencing companionship
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:38.160]   from this dog. He's excited. Yeah. It's definitely, it's definitely a nice dog. Yeah. Nice dog.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:46.000]   Doesn't bite. Jake, I think one thing that would be great, based on the kinds of customers you have,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.840]   can you tell us a little bit about the sales life cycle and the type of deals you do? I mean,
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.840]   it's so interesting to, is it like an enterprise software type sale? And you know, when you're going
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.360]   in and doing a physical workplace. I mean, I didn't know where to sit. Were you worried about the dog?
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.880]   No, this was, it's a very poorly organized conference. Yeah. Let's talk about that.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.240]   We only told you where to sit five times in the last four minutes, but.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.640]   I don't understand these images. I have, you know. Literally yesterday, we go in there after and like,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.880]   Sergei comes, he does his first thing. And I'm like, Sergei's like, oh yeah, do you have any food?
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   I go out to the food and it's just like rubber conference checking in the VIP speaker area.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.160]   And I'm like, Freyberg, can we just get some sushi from Nobu? We should go through all the details.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.680]   Yeah. No, tell us about the sales life cycle. So what are the kinds of deals you're not talking
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.520]   about rubber chicken right now? We've got a panel. But yeah, tell us about the sales life cycle.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.120]   The juice has been really good, by the way. Thank you.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.600]   Yeah. So the life cycle, it's been, it's been, it's been wild. So, you know,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.480]   Gecko actually became profitable in 2017, right after YC's launch in 2016. And so the-
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   You were a YC company? Yes, 2016. And what was interesting about that was,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   you know, we decided to build a company very forward deployed. So instead of building robots
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   in labs, actually funny story, one of the VCs you had here last year offered a bunch of money at YC
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:13.440]   for us not to leave and go back to Pittsburgh and do this forward deployed motion of building robots,
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.600]   but instead build it in a lab. And I turned that down because I just fundamentally didn't believe in
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:25.360]   that way of building. And so, but, so we decided to launch into the, and build robots, like literally
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.280]   soldered in these environments before, and just figure out how to make the robots work in reality,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.840]   in the real world. And so the sales motion was basically, we would go to the plant managers.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:39.440]   Sometimes I'd call and be like, Hey, my pizza guy, like, you know, where's the, where's the plant manager?
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   Can I talk to him? And I'd get, figure out how to get to the plant managers. And then I'd
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:50.160]   convince them to let us work with them in their facilities. And so started out that way by selling
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.040]   to the folks who need this the most. Yeah. And so, but now I'm talking to obviously CTOs and CFOs
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.280]   because our products are actually very financial and helps with depreciation models. It helps with
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:08.000]   optimizations, but we started by just selling to the folks on the ground and building the robot by
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.840]   failing a bunch of times there and fixing it live. But now we have a great platform. And so now
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.480]   when customers buy Gekko, the only way they can buy it is through software. So they buy cantilever
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.640]   and they bought it, they buy an implementation of the software, which is the robots getting the data.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.840]   And then they pay for a license for the software. And we try to make data refreshes,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.720]   which is basically robots going out and collecting more information free.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.640]   Is there a custom deployment in every one of these? Because they've all got to have different
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:40.880]   facilities and how hard is it to kind of customize or you have standard standardization now in each
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.680]   deployment to kind of do a Chinese menu type selection?
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.520]   Yeah. We try,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.160]   so it's a great question. We started in the beginning by letting the customers pick what kinds
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.440]   of data layers they want. So data layers basically mean what kind of robots. Now we actually don't
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.080]   allow them to do that. We follow all the standards, whatever like API, which is like these governing
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.560]   bodies about how to take care of infrastructure. But then we go way beyond that because I want to create
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.680]   an incredible user experience that they cannot revert back from.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:13.360]   Jake, there's all kinds of crippling infrastructure problems around the world
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.120]   that are not necessarily tied to some of the obvious industries like oil and gas.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.560]   So I'll give you two examples. One was what happened in Baltimore where,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.480]   you know, this, who knows how it happened, but basically the bridge just collapsed in a situation that,
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.560]   and maybe it was supposed to be, and it did. Another example was a few years ago in Genoa, in Italy,
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.200]   an entire slab of a bridge just collapsed and it fell on top of an environment and killed a bunch
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:46.720]   of innocent civilians. So there's, I think, a public safety requirement here, which is like some
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.560]   of this stuff was either designed poorly or designed very quickly. How much of that is observable by these
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:59.280]   kinds of robots? And how do you convince folks that beyond depreciation and financial motivations,
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.440]   there's a, you know, a real need to make sure that this public infrastructure is safe and you guys can
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.000]   secure it?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.560]   Um, great question. So the answer to, uh, of how can we actually get information on those types of
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.760]   instances? Yes. Um, we, we, like you can look at a concrete bridge and say, Hey, there's some decay
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   here, or there's something that's happening in the girding here. And you can recognize that and learn
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   and be able to say, wait a minute, you need to send inspectors or shut the bridge down or
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.120]   stop and figure this out. You first want to do, so what the robots are really good at is getting
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.160]   a crap ton of data about the assets. And then you can pinpoint exactly where to put fixed sensors
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.920]   in specific locations that will be indicative, but then also because of our, of our, you know, we have
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:47.440]   this like really interesting data set that tells us because of so many different types of situations,
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:54.480]   what kinds of potential issues are occurring that we can extrapolate out to these types of situations
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.800]   that we might be not as familiar with. So we'll put fixed sensors on to give us indications
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.080]   and give us some ability to help prioritize spending. And so, um, you know, we just actually
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.760]   signed a contract with governor Shapiro to do this for bridges in Allegheny County and in Pennsylvania,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:16.320]   where Pittsburgh is. And, um, we're helping to modernize bridge maintenance and prioritization of
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.240]   budget because what you can see here is you don't necessarily need to rebuild stuff. And in some ways
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   that's not even practical, but you can figure out where to deploy capital. Um, and then, by the way,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.760]   did you see this video on X where somebody was going through the Lincoln tunnel and it looked like
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   it was about to burst? There was like water creaking in and it was really disconcerting. Yeah. Um, but
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.280]   I think it was more of a design feature to actually like alleviate when times when the water levels were
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.840]   super high. But my point is there's all of this stuff that we interact with that it would be good to
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:51.200]   know that there's a, you know, a service out there looking for it. And is, is there a world where you could
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.160]   also then theoretically ingest like the actual architectural or CAD of these things and then
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.080]   also be able to do diffs and variants and be able to tell people, Hey, hold on a second. This is not conforming to
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.920]   how we thought it should be behaving. Yes. We do. We do pull those in as much as we can, but it's important to remember
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.440]   that most of the infrastructure that I'm talking about is like 60 years old. Um, now on the new build side,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.080]   like for the new Columbia class submarines, for example, um, there's an issue where like,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.000]   there's not a digital thread. You have like 5,000 different contractors that are trying to make us
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.760]   most powerful sub in the world and they're handing paper to each other, um, as they build the submarine.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.480]   And so it causes one to be a bunch of delays and issues, which we're seeing with a lot of our ability,
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.440]   like China, for example, can outbuild us by 232 times, uh, submarines that is, or, or new ships.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.520]   And a big part of like art are like, we have to be able to figure out how to be smarter when we
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   manufacture. And so one of the ways you can do that is digital threads all the way through the
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.880]   manufacturing process so that we're not like delayed by handing paper to each other that may or may not
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.760]   be incorrect. And for the customers that we work with, you know, most of them, you know, you're looking
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:03.440]   at drawings that are 60 years old. They have never been converted. Um, I, we even try to get asset lists
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.280]   from customers and they're like, we don't have it. So we have to go out and actually build that for them.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.200]   How should we build a submarine just off topic? How should we build it?
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.560]   Yeah. So we don't have 5,000 contractors at 0.1% or 0.2% the speed of China.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.400]   It's a good, it's a good question. I think we should orient to a most efficient, um, way of
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.920]   building as many components in one place as we can. But you have to remember as well, you know,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:28.960]   congressional members have their own constituents to advocate for. And so they want to bring jobs to
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.600]   their, to the local communities. And so in a, in a democracy, it's really tough actually.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.000]   Mm-hmm. Jake, how do you see, um,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.960]   where your bots, your robots, and let's say the more traditional generalized humanoid robots
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.280]   intersect and when they meet, how do you think about that problem?
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.080]   Oh, it's a great question. Um, I am so excited to buy as many Optimus robots as possible.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.560]   Yeah. You're a customer. You'll be a customer.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.320]   A hundred percent. You're not going to be a competitor?
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.280]   No, no, no. I mean, um, look at any botics right here. So this is a, this is a sweet,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   it's a company based in Switzerland that have an incredible robot and their data doesn't know where to
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.200]   go. And so the, the idea of robots, this is what I firmly believe is that-
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.240]   Zach's taking them home today.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.840]   Is that, um, you know, they get sensors to places that are really hard to get sensors to.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.200]   And so that information has to be funneled, um, somewhere to drive some large business outcome.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.720]   So I really don't think like, you know, I am not of the belief, I guess, that when Elon talks about,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.000]   you know, two times the amount of, um, robots as humans, that you'll see them in society actually,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.080]   as much as you may, maybe you'd think, I think they're actually gonna be found mostly in these,
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.040]   like, really dangerous, behind the scenes, industrial settings, which I, in my opinion,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.120]   that's like where they should start for sure, because you'll have to, you know, one, you have
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.800]   to, those are really complex tasks, but two, they're like very beneficial for humanity.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.680]   Um, so like, is there, is there a generalized platform that you've built that allows you to
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.400]   solve for these different use cases, or do you find that there's
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.200]   a lot of application specific engineering that's required?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   Good question. So we, we, we built an API platform for robots where companies can try
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   their systems out and we can, because we have a go to market, we can now test if that robot is
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.840]   producing something valuable from a data side. Right.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.880]   And I'm not actually as interested in robots that can weld or robots that can clean right now.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.760]   Mostly I'm just interested in just like, what kind of information and data can we build better
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   operating platforms and systems on? And, um, so that's, that's where I'm starting. And we'll begin to
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.480]   add more robots that can do different kinds of jobs. But, um, you know, I think it's, you have,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.520]   I think this is where first ordered data sets and, and, and software companies have become more and more,
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:44.240]   you know, powerful. This is why maybe, you know, um, my opinion on the, the standalone SaaS model is like,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.360]   I think it's going away. Um, because the companies that are so advantaged with first order data, you can,
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.440]   you know, just build your own software.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.720]   have a capital markets last question of capital markets kind of embraced the story or things
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:03.280]   you can invest. Okay. Yeah. Um, yeah, they, they really are. I think, um,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.360]   cause there's a lot of this like hesitation around deep tech and hardware historically,
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.840]   but you've obviously got an incredible software layer and great recurring business. So you seem to
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.600]   be pretty differentiated in terms of all, a lot of the long haul build cycles that I think we see out there.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.080]   And, uh, yeah, and hardware in our case is very sticky. Yeah. Because, you know, once you convert
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.200]   from, you know, paper and you're now not using binders, you're using cantilever. Yeah. Um, it's,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.480]   it's really hard to go back. Yeah. I just, yeah, I think it's, we've talked before and I think what
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.760]   you're doing is so inspiring because it feels to me like this technology, you know, that we've seen over
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:47.440]   the last 20 years in iPhones in EVs and sensors, um, is now allowing us to move from being reactive
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.760]   and trying to figure out what happened to then saying, Hey, let's be proactive. What are the
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:59.440]   opportunities here to extend life, to sit, you know, extend the life of these assets, um, and avoid tragedies.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:06.000]   And I just, you know, I think the work you're doing is a real grinders work, but it's going to save lives.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.640]   And it's going to really save taxpayers money that can be deployed in other places for beautiful things.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.680]   And so I just want to commend you on doing something that is so essential. Um, in many
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:22.000]   times I meet a founder and they are doing something and I just think, God, I, I don't know if this is
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.400]   going to work or not, but I know that this founder is going to figure out a way to make it work.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.480]   And I think it's just really rare that somebody cares so much about something and then executes as
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.240]   hard as you have. Um, and I just want to tell you, I personally very much appreciate it because
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:41.680]   you know, when a bridge collapses, I know the one in Italy, it's, it was a very big tragedy.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.760]   I think it killed 50 odd people and it was privately owned. Yeah. And there's a, you know,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.040]   very, very wealthy family that owned it. And ultimately, sadly, no repercussions.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.360]   Yeah. Same with dams in Brazil, same with dams in Brazil. Right. So, you know,
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.480]   as public infrastructure becomes private infrastructure, then the profit motive supersedes the safety motive.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.720]   you're going to get all these things unless there's, um, um, some sort of check and balance.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.000]   So long way of saying we very much appreciate this hard work that you've done.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.080]   Last question. Yeah. You're, you're, you know, you're, you've been in the YC community for a long time.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.360]   Just really, you don't have to say yes or no, but have you ever been forced to do any founder mode?
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.280]   Did you feel pressure? Have you just, just blink twice, Jake, just tell us the truth.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.840]   Jake, thank you for joining us.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:31.360]   That's awesome. That was awesome.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.400]   That was excellent.
