[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   Cameron, a listener from London, writes in, "Dear Pastor John, to what extent is the goodness
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.480]   and glory of the Christian's understanding of human sexuality spiritually discerned?"
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.960]   Animals have instincts that cause them to mate and reproduce.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   Viewed from a God-centered perspective, that is amazing.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.560]   That's an amazing thing.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.840]   It reveals the glory of God the Creator.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.240]   How do they know how to do that?
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:49.080]   How do those birds know to splay their feathers in just that way to attract her at just that
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.440]   time?
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:59.900]   How does that frog know to change the tone of her chirrup-chirrup so that the species
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.520]   goes on?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.320]   The earth is full of the wonders of God.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.120]   In wisdom you have made them all.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.480]   We watch, and with the eyes awakened to God, we see the glory of God in all of it, all
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.320]   that sexuality.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.020]   So it is with human sexuality.
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.080]   We have instincts and desires and understandings that cause us to make love and reproduce the
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080]   race.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.120]   But without eyes to see the goodness and the glory of God in our sexuality, we are more
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   like animals than we are like God.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.200]   And that's not what God calls us to be or to do.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.920]   So when you read what the Bible has to say about sex, you are thrown into a world of
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.040]   divine glory.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.900]   And if we don't have eyes to see, we'll miss it.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.320]   So when Cameron asks, "To what extent is the goodness and the glory of the Christian understanding
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.280]   of human sexuality spiritually discerned?"
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.560]   My answer is, "All of it, totally."
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.320]   It is totally discerned spiritually.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.840]   Without spiritual life, without the awakening of our spirit by the Spirit of God, the reality
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.440]   of God, the glory of God, in all things, we may have intense feelings and poetic thoughts
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.160]   about sex, even far above the animals, but we will never see the goodness and the glory
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.960]   that God reveals of Himself in and through our sexuality.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.800]   Without spiritual discernment—that is, without the awakening and the transforming work of
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.520]   the Holy Spirit through faith in Christ—we only rise to the level of nature and never
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.920]   see in it the glory of God.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.480]   So let me illustrate with a few passages.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.040]   First Corinthians 2:14, "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.560]   God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.600]   are spiritually discerned."
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.640]   We are merely natural—in other words, without new birth by the Spirit—and as such, the
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   things of the Spirit are not discernible to us.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.800]   Discerning the things of the Spirit means seeing all things the way the Spirit does.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.960]   Things of the Spirit are not just a class of things, but are all things revealing the
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.280]   truth of God and the glory of God and the reality of Christ by the Spirit.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.840]   So the Bible says that the role of the Spirit is to glorify Christ.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.960]   So the things of the Spirit are all things in their capacities to reveal Christ, like
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.680]   sex.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.440]   We will never see that.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   We will never see what sex has to do with the glorious reality for which we are made
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.920]   Jesus Christ without those eyes, the spiritual eyes.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.480]   Here's another text, Ephesians 5:25, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.720]   and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.220]   of water and the words, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.680]   spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish."
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:49.480]   The whole drama of marriage, including sex, is a drama about the glories of Christ's
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.000]   covenant relation to his bride, the church.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.240]   None of this is visible or enjoyable for the person without spiritual discernment.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.880]   Another text, two more, 1 Corinthians 6, 15.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   Shall I then take members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.200]   Never.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:27.560]   Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.480]   For as it is written, the two become one flesh.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.320]   But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:45.920]   I mean, could Paul have woven together the most nitty-gritty physical reality, like prostitution,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.560]   with the most spiritual reality of our oneness with Christ?
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.720]   Prostitution, he says, is about Christ, what you do with Christ.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.600]   So not only can we not see the glories of sex without spiritual discernment, we can't
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.800]   see the prostitution of the glories of sex without spiritual discernment.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.480]   One more, Mark 10, 7.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480]   Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.440]   two shall become one flesh.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   So they're no longer two, but one flesh.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.400]   But God has joined together, let not man separate.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   Mind-boggling.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.560]   God joins us together in sex.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   This is a great and unseen glory of marriage.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.240]   Who sees this?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:55.080]   Who marvels at this, that marriage and its sexual union is a work of God?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   God is at work at a wedding ceremony.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   God is at work that night in bed.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.440]   Who sees this?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.960]   Those who are spiritually awake, those who are spiritually discerning.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:19.420]   So yes, Cameron, yes, the goodness and the glory of sexuality is for those with eyes
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:27.200]   to see, and those eyes are a gift of the Spirit through faith in Christ.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   Amen.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:55.640]   Well a big question for a lot of Christians today is over ISIS and Islamic militants around
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.820]   the world.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.020]   Should we pray that ISIS members be saved, or should we pray that they be destroyed?
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.260]   I'll ask John Piper that tomorrow.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.780]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.320]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
