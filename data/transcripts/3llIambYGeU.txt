[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.220]   Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians in the fourth chapter, and reading the first
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.820]   six verses.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.460]   The first six verses in the fourth chapter of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.900]   "Therefore, seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not, but
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.020]   have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.720]   word of God deceitfully, but, by manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260]   man's conscience in the sight of God.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.740]   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.980]   hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.380]   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.580]   For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves ye were servants for
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.180]   Jesus' sake.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.660]   For God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:24.260]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.380]   Many here present will remember that we are looking at this great statement, these six
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.260]   verses, for the fourth time.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.120]   We are looking here at a statement made by the Apostle Paul about himself and about his
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.620]   preaching.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.380]   He is obviously making a statement partly in self-defence, and it was, of course, the
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580]   result of charges which certain people had been bringing against him, saying that he
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.060]   was not an apostle at all, that he had no right to preach.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.660]   Well, the Apostle is writing to these people, who are members of the Church at Corinth,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.020]   largely as the result of his preaching, just to refute that charge.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.900]   But he does not stop at that, of course.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.540]   He is really not concerned about himself.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.740]   He is concerned about the truth of the gospel.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.180]   And so he takes advantage of the opportunity to tell these people the way in which he did
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.740]   preach it.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.100]   And do you notice that he says that he had renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.540]   that he was not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.860]   He was not playing any tricks on them.
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.860]   He was not out just to make money or to make a name for himself.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.820]   He was not just concerned to entertain people, no, no.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:52.180]   He said, "I realise that I am handling the word of God, and I dare not handle that deceitfully,"
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.180]   says the Apostle.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.540]   "It is my word, I am not talking about myself.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.180]   We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord."
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.340]   He realises that what he is doing, he does in the sight of God.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.340]   And whatever he may have been tempted to do as a man, realising that the eye of God was
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.980]   upon him, he dared not do any of these things.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.060]   But he is just concerned to make bare, make known the truth.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.140]   And he does that for Christ's sake, who is his master.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.500]   He does it for their sake, and he is their servant, in order that he may help them.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.180]   That is his attitude.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.100]   He is a man who has already told these Corinthians in the first epistle that he is ready to make
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.920]   himself all things to all men, in order that he might by all means save some.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.540]   This preaching of the gospel, he says, is a very serious thing.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.340]   In the next chapter he is going on to tell them that he knows that he and everybody else
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.060]   will have to stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and give an account of the deeds
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.900]   done in the body, whether they are good or bad, knowing therefore, he says, the terror
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.940]   of the Lord, I persuade men.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.020]   Now, that is what he tells us about himself.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.100]   You see, here is a man who says quite plainly, he says, I am not giving you my own opinions,
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.140]   this isn't just what I think.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.340]   He says, I am the servant of Christ, and all I am repeating is what he gave me, what he
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.340]   told me.
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.180]   Here was a man, you see, who had been a great opponent of Christianity, a blasphemer, a
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.900]   man who hated Christ and his gospel, and did everything he could to kill the infant Christian
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.380]   church and to bring it to ruin.
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.700]   And yet here he is preaching the gospel, what caused the change, well, you know the story.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   He saw Christ on the road to Damascus.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.380]   The living, glorified Christ looked down upon him and spoke to him.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.740]   And he made him a minister, a preacher, and he told him what to say.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.020]   And as he says, it isn't his message, it is the word of God, it is this truth.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.540]   This precious message, this gospel.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.340]   These are the terms that he uses.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.660]   Now then, why am I calling attention to all this?
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.580]   Well, my dear friends, because as the apostle tells us this about his preaching, he is incidentally
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.220]   telling us at the same time as to why we should listen to it.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.300]   You see, we are living in days when it is no longer the thing to do to go to chapel
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.980]   or church on Sunday.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.940]   Only ten percent of the people of this country even attempt to do so, and they don't do it
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.940]   regularly.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940]   Only about half of them do it regularly.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.340]   Now, there are the facts, and the average man says, "Well, why should I go and listen
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.340]   to that gospel?"
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.180]   Play it out, finished.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.620]   All right a hundred years ago, all right a thousand years ago, but of course, nothing
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.500]   to tell me, a modern man in 1961 with the world as it is tonight.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.220]   He feels it utterly irrelevant.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.900]   Well, now the apostle tells us here why we should listen to this gospel.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.180]   And my dear friend, for what it's worth, that's my only reason for preaching it.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.460]   I wouldn't be preaching it except for these reasons.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.940]   And these are the reasons, I say, why every one of us should listen to it.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.340]   And remember, as we are doing so, that it's not only true to say of me that I'm preaching
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.200]   in the sight of God.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.620]   You remember that you are also listening in the sight of God.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.220]   Now, I'm not going to give you my opinions on South Africa tonight.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.660]   I'm not going to give you my opinions on war, or on peace, or on bombs, or on anything else.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.020]   I'm just going to give you this message that has been given to me through these apostles.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.580]   And I'm going to tell you why it's very important that you and everybody else should listen
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.460]   to it.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.980]   I've been putting it like this, I put it again like this.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.880]   This sounds egotistical, doesn't it?
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.260]   But it isn't.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.780]   I'm asserting that you are listening at this moment, you're going to listen to the most
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.980]   important thing you'll ever hear.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.980]   Is that egotistical?
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.060]   Of course it isn't, because it isn't my opinion, it isn't my theory, it isn't my teaching.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.420]   It's the teaching that I have before me.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.780]   I'm simply expounding the scriptures, I'm doing in my feeble way what this great apostle
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.660]   did, manifestation of the truth.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:26.180]   I'm only here to draw back the curtains that you may see this truth, this word of God,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.140]   this gospel, this message.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.420]   And you see, it is a gospel.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.420]   And what's that?
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.300]   Well, that means good news.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.780]   The gospel is good news.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.740]   What a tragedy it is that people don't know that.
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.580]   Everybody wants to hear good news.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.380]   Everybody tonight would like to hear some good news.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.580]   They say the world is dark, the war clouds are gathering, things are very precarious.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.580]   "Oh," says man, "if only I could hear some good news."
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.900]   Well, that's what this gospel is.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.060]   That's the meaning of the word "gospel."
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.900]   It is good news.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.700]   It's the best and the greatest good news that has ever come to men.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:12.700]   But of course, the tragedy is that the vast majority of people are not aware of it.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.660]   Most people tonight would think it would be a terrible waste of time to sit in a chapel
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.820]   like this and listen to a sermon.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.500]   What a waste of time when you can look at the television, when you can look at a boxing
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.020]   match, and when you can look at people clowning, making fools of themselves, praising drink
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.020]   and getting drunk, dancing, exposing themselves, marvelous, fancy wasting time listening to
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.820]   a sermon, when you can do that, isn't that the attitude?
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.020]   They ridicule it.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.100]   But this is good news.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.100]   What does that mean?
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.580]   Well, the apostle tells us.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.740]   This is good news for this reason, that it is, as he says, "light."
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.820]   You notice he talks here, "lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.020]   image of God, should shine unto them.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:02.580]   God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts."
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.720]   The gospel is light.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   It's good news.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   Why?
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   Why?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   Well, for this reason.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.180]   It is good news because it gives us knowledge.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.780]   It gives us instruction.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.980]   You see, we don't spend our time here singing choruses, sentimental ditties.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.060]   No, no, it's the people on the television who do that.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.460]   We think here, "This is light.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.460]   This is truth.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   This is knowledge.
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.740]   This is an appeal to men to think and to reason and to face facts, the highest and the greatest
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.820]   facts that can ever confront the human mind.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.940]   It's light, and light is always something that dissipates darkness and enables men to
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.940]   see things.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.900]   You can't see in the dark.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.420]   You need light before you can see.
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:52.700]   Well, it's light, it's knowledge, it's instruction, it's information.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.580]   And it is light and knowledge and instruction and information concerning the most vital,
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:05.860]   the most important, the most urgent facts that we can ever consider.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.860]   What are they?
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:13.300]   Well, now then, I was trying to indicate last Sunday night that the first bit of light the
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.780]   gospel gives us is light about ourselves.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.460]   Light about ourselves.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.700]   Why is the world as it is tonight?
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.220]   Do you know the answer?
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.820]   I can tell you.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.740]   The world is as it is tonight because you are as you are tonight.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.700]   The world is made up, after all, of men and women.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.100]   There's no such thing as a world, an abstraction, apart from men and women.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.340]   The world is ourselves.
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.060]   So the world is as it is because men and women are as they are.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.620]   So you see, if you are concerned about the whole problem of the world tonight, and if
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.220]   you want to put an end to these bombs and want to abolish war and want to have this
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.620]   world as a kind of paradise, you know the first thing you've got to do?
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.780]   Well, you know, strangely enough, it isn't to listen to the politicians and the statesmen.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.580]   It's to listen to this message.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:15.640]   For here is the only message that will explain to you why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.620]   And the world is as it is because men is as he is.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.060]   And what's the matter with him?
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.180]   Well, we've seen it, haven't we?
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.540]   Man's in a state of darkness, in a state of ignorance.
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:34.900]   Man as he is born into this world in sin and all that he inherits from his forefathers
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:42.660]   is, according to the Apostle, like the conditions that prevailed at the very dawn of history.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.020]   You'll read it in the second verse in the book of Genesis, which is the first book in
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.500]   the Bible.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.380]   Everything was chaos.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.500]   The spirit brooded over the darkness, the chaos.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.660]   The earth was without form.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.660]   It was void.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.940]   That's what we are told.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.100]   It was darkness.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.220]   Everything in a state of muddle, chaos.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.780]   And it would have continued like that, were it not that God said, "Let there be light,"
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.780]   and there was light.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.100]   And out of that came the order, the cosmos, out of the chaos.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:22.260]   Well, no, it's exactly the same, says the Apostle here, with regard to the totality
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.020]   of men and women in the world and with regard to every single individual in the world.
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.260]   We're all born in darkness, in ignorance.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.540]   We're all born in this chaotic state.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.540]   There's no form in our lives.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.800]   We're without form and void.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   We don't know where we are.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.900]   We don't know where we are going.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.180]   We don't know what we need.
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.140]   We don't know really what we want.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.380]   And that's the condition of men.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.620]   Well, but we need to be told that, don't we?
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.540]   And you see, there's nothing that tells us that but this gospel.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.900]   The newspapers don't tell you that, do they?
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.380]   The newspapers are always saying it's somebody else.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.260]   It's always, "You're Hitler," or, "You're Stalin," or, "You're Khrushchev, Mussolini,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.240]   some other nation, one section of the nation.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   It's the masters."
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   No, it's the workmen.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   And there you are.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.300]   They say it's somebody else, but the Bible comes and says, "No, no, it's you.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.780]   It's you yourself."
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:22.540]   And it says that to everybody, brings us all down to the same level, humbles us every one.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.540]   Doesn't say, "He's right.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.540]   You're wrong."
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.540]   Both are wrong.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.680]   Every one of us is a sinner.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.580]   We've all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.580]   There is none righteous.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.640]   No, not one, not a single person.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.460]   Now then, it is the light of the gospel that tells us that.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.420]   And it's a marvelous thing to know the truth about yourself.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.780]   None of us will ever be right until we know the truth about ourselves.
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.600]   The gospel tells us, and here it is.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.880]   But that's only the beginning.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   We must go on.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.480]   Having thrown this light upon me and upon myself as I rarely am, having exposed my ignorance
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   and darkness to me about my state, thank God the gospel doesn't stop.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.240]   Because if it stopped at that point, it wouldn't really be good news, would it?
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.600]   It would be very bad news.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.840]   It would be the worst news we'd ever had.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.840]   But it doesn't stop at that.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   It goes on.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.200]   It's got to start with that, but then it goes on.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.360]   And then it goes on to tell us how we can be delivered out of that condition.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.800]   See, that's why Paul made himself all things to all men.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.520]   That's why he says to these people, "I'm your servant for Jesus' sake."
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.920]   That's why he says, "God forbid that I should use chicanery or any trickery.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.000]   I can't handle this word of God deceitfully."
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.040]   Paul says, "I know that your soul, your eternal destiny, depends upon what I say and how I
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   say it.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.680]   I'm going to do nothing.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.560]   I determine not to do anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified, lest
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.480]   anybody should follow me, lest anybody should praise me and not see Him."
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.960]   "Oh no," says Paul, "I can't afford to take risks."
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.320]   And that is why he preached in the way he did.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.440]   Well, now then, what is this remedy?
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.480]   What is this way of escape that the gospel has got to offer us?
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.400]   Well, now I want to hold part of it before you this evening.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.960]   The apostle puts it like this.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.600]   He's got a wonderful phrase here.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   In the fourth verse he says, "In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.520]   them which believe not lest."
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:33.560]   The light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   them.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.040]   Now, that's what I want to hold before you this evening.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.640]   But let me give you a better translation.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   Lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, that's what it means.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:57.720]   The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.200]   them.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   What is this message?
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:08.040]   It is the message concerning the glory of Christ.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   What is this?
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.520]   Well, my friend, this is the very essence of the Christian message.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.000]   The world thinks it knows all about Christ, but it doesn't.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.360]   The world is as it is because it doesn't know the glory of Christ.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.640]   It's just that.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.200]   Let me show you.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   What is Christianity?
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.240]   "Oh," says somebody, "Christianity is doing good.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.200]   Christianity is stopping certain sins, taking up certain good works.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.960]   Christianity is reading your Bible, saying your prayers, going to chapel."
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   No, no.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.560]   You can do all that and not be a Christian at all.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:51.620]   Christianity in the first instance is Christ himself, this person.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.140]   Christianity is not a teaching.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.040]   Oh, how utterly confused men and women still are about this.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.600]   It's almost impossible to believe it can happen, but it is still happening.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.960]   People will persist in thinking that this is just one among a number of teachings.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.460]   Their philosophy, sociology, and Christianity, they put it in as one of a number of teachings
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.120]   offering itself to mankind.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.880]   They say there are many religions, there are many ways of getting happiness.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   This is one of them.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   But you know, it isn't that at all.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.700]   It isn't a teaching primarily.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   What is it then?
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.400]   Well, it's history.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   This is a bit of history.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.980]   The Bible is a book of history.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.620]   So I'm not here to tell you tonight about certain views of life and certain aspects
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.040]   of Christian teaching with regard to this, that, or the other.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.040]   No, no.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.560]   I've got to start where the Apostle said he always started, the glory of Christ.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.400]   "What do you mean?" says somebody.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.280]   Well, I want to tell you about something that has actually happened in this world, about
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.360]   an event that belongs to history.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.160]   You see, we call this 1961, don't we?
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   Why?
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.960]   Well, because roughly 1961 years ago, there was a person in this world who was called
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.200]   Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   Now, that's the glory of Christ.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.520]   Here's one who's changed the calendar.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.040]   Everything is dated from him before Christ, after Christ, the years of the Lord, Anno
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.880]   Domini, 1961.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.920]   But you see, both of them are pointing to him.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.480]   Here is the pivot of history.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.440]   Here's the turning point in the whole story of the human race.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.640]   Jesus of Nazareth, this person.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.520]   Well, now then, Paul says, "You know, the trouble is that the devil is blinding the
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:46.640]   eyes and the minds of men and women, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.040]   should shine unto them."
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.200]   What does this mean?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.280]   Well, let me tell you what it means.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:05.200]   Let me hold some mere portion of it before you, the glory of it all.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.480]   Think first of all of the glory of his person.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.800]   Here it is.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   There was once a person in this world called Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.440]   Now then, the whole of this message is about him.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   Who is he?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.080]   The glory of Christ.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   Well, very well.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Let's examine it.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   What does it mean?
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:32.040]   Well, the apostle tells us immediately, the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.680]   image of God.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:41.280]   Now then, here's a fact.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.680]   What's the story of the human race?
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.360]   Well, the story of the human race is this.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.680]   Adam and Eve begat Abel and Cain, and so on, Seth.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.160]   You read these old genealogical tables, go to Somerset House and read others.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.120]   This is the story of the world, isn't it?
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   So and so begat.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.560]   This man married that woman, and they begat.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.680]   He in turn married another woman, and they begat.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   And on and on it goes.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.000]   People getting married, children appearing, they getting married, children appearing.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.560]   It's gone on and on and on like that right down the running centuries, and that's human
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.320]   history, isn't it?
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.760]   It's a strange and a jagged history.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.840]   Some of these people who've been born have been very clever.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.040]   Some have not been clever.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.720]   Some have had great brains, some have had no brains practically at all.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   Some have been great men of learning, others have been very ignorant.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.560]   Some have been great statesmen, others great generals, some kings, princes.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.600]   I know, but you know, they've all come out of somebody else.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.560]   So and so begat, begat, begat, on it goes.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:52.240]   And they're all human, and they're all flesh and blood like everybody else.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.600]   But you know, this is the thing, and this is the most important fact confronting the
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.840]   whole world tonight.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:06.880]   There has been one person in this world who doesn't belong to all that.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:15.440]   This Christ, this Jesus of Nazareth, why is he different?
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.880]   I'll tell you why.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.160]   All the others are bearing the image of either their father or their mother, or the grandfather
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.960]   or the grandmother on one side or the other, or perhaps it's the image of a little bit
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.080]   of mixture of all of them, but that's their image.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.120]   But not so this one, the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.080]   Who is the image of God?
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.560]   Now then, this is what made Paul a preacher, this fact.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   This is what makes me a preacher, or anybody a preacher, this fact.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.400]   Well now, the Bible's full of this, you see.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.720]   That's the great message of the beginning of John's gospel.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720]   You've heard it, haven't you?
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:02.200]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.360]   By him were all things made, and without him was nothing made that is made.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:14.160]   The Word that was in the beginning."
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.520]   This person, Jesus, this Christ, he's the image of God.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:24.360]   Do you remember how he put it himself one afternoon, towards the end of his life, just
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.520]   about this time of the year, just a short time before he died upon the cross on that
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.600]   Friday?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.360]   He told his disciples that he was dying, though he was only about thirty-three, and they were
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.640]   crestfallen, they were utterly miserable.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.520]   He said, "Let not your hearts be troubled, you believe in God, believe also in me."
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.000]   He says, "It's all right, I'm going to prepare a place for you in my Father's house of many
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   mansions.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.320]   I'm going to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.600]   come again and receive you unto myself."
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.480]   "That's all right," said one of them, called Thomas, who was a bit of a doubter.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.600]   "Lord," he said, "we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way?"
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.480]   Do you remember the answer he was given?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.600]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:18.760]   And then another one called Philip, he was in trouble, he says, "I don't understand this."
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:25.160]   He said, "Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.920]   And our Lord looked at him and said, "Hast thou not known me, Philip?
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.840]   Have I been so long time with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip?
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:41.120]   He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.480]   Now, here is one who stood amongst them as apparently a man and just a carpenter at that,
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.280]   yet that is what he says, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.760]   Another time he said, "The Father and I are one."
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.000]   He said again, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.240]   Listen to him.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.600]   Then did you hear what we read just now in the second chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   Philippians?
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:12.440]   "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God?"
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.960]   That's what we are told about him.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.880]   That's the person we are considering.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.720]   Or listen to it as Paul puts it in writing to the Colossians.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.800]   He says, "In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:32.760]   My friend, this Jesus of Nazareth is one in whom there dwelt the whole fullness of the
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:36.560]   Godhead bodily.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.760]   Or did you notice it there in that first chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews?
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:51.120]   "Who," he says there in this wonderful phrase—let me give it to you exactly and accurately—"being
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:58.800]   the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person."
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   God.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.640]   He is talking about this Son, Jesus Christ, God who at sundry times and in divers manner
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.760]   speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:17.800]   us by his Son, whom he hath made heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds, who
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:24.240]   being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person."
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.480]   Now then, this is the thing that the world doesn't realize, the world doesn't seem to
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   know this.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.280]   "Oh," it says, "I know all about Jesus Christ."
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.800]   But do you?
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.360]   This is what the statement is, in other words.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:42.520]   Here is one who is obviously man, yes, but he is more, he is God.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:49.680]   He is the image of God, which means the exact likeness of God.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.120]   He is the living image, you say.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.240]   You look at a baby, he is the living image of his father.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.400]   Ah, you look at the face and you see the father.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:01.720]   Well, now then, what we are told is that when you look into this face, you see God.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.680]   The image, the likeness of God.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:13.760]   Now what we are concerned therefore to preach is that here is one who is absolutely alone
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   and apart.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.280]   That's why you should listen to him.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.160]   He is God as well as man, he has got two natures in him, he is only one person, but he is divine
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.480]   and he is human at the same time.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.960]   And you know, everything about him tells us that his birth was different.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.800]   An archangel went to Mary who bore him as her babe, and he told her that she was going
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.720]   to bear a child, and she said, "How can this be?
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   I've never known a man.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   I'm a virgin.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   I'm not married.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   How can I have a child?
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.000]   I've never had any contact with a man."
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.720]   "It's all right," said the archangel, "the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:52.840]   of the All-Highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.420]   Therefore that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.600]   You see, his birth was unusual, he hadn't a human father, he never had a father.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   He was born of a virgin, it was a miracle, nobody could understand it.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.680]   Even Joseph, who later married her, didn't at first, he stumbled.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.560]   An angel had to speak to him and tell him, but that's how he was born.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.880]   My dear friends, is the whole of your life revolving around this fact?
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.960]   We are not left to ourselves, you know, as we face the war clouds and the bombs and all
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.560]   the strain of life at the present time.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.200]   This is what the world needs to know, that this person has been in this world, Son of
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   God, the image of God.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.120]   Everything about him proclaimed it.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.760]   Did you notice his learning?
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.800]   Read your Gospels.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.620]   At the age of twelve he knew more than the doctors of the law.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.160]   He could turn them back and refute them and confute them, and everybody was amazed and
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.940]   astounded at his learning.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.680]   Then he began to teach, and though he was an ordinary man, he'd been working as a carpenter
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.880]   from the age of twelve to the age of thirty, he'd never been to the schools or the colleges
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880]   at all.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   He knew more than anybody else.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.360]   He spoke with absolute authority, and he amazed everybody.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.400]   The common people said, "This man speaketh with authority and not as these scribes and
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   Pharisees."
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.040]   And the Pharisees and scribes said, "How is this man learning, never having learned?
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.360]   They couldn't understand him."
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.160]   Of course they couldn't understand him.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.960]   And then he worked miracles.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.040]   Nobody had seen things like this before.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   John the Baptist was a great man, but he worked no miracles.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:34.400]   But this one could make the dead rise, he could make the deaf hear, he could give sight
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.440]   to the blind.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.440]   There was nothing he couldn't do.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.440]   He could heal the lame.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.720]   He'd cause them to leap as the heart.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   Amazing, astounding.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   What's this?
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.640]   Well, it's the glory of his person that's coming out in these ways.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.080]   All these are but signs of who he is and of his glory.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.560]   You know, three men were with him called Peter and James and John.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.760]   They went up to the top of a mountain with him on one occasion, and suddenly a cloud
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.880]   overshadowed them.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.280]   And they looked at him and they saw him absolutely transfigured.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.960]   Not only was his face shining, his very clothes were shining.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.280]   He was glorified in their presence.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:18.740]   There was a radiance and a glory that could come from nowhere but him, and they saw it.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.480]   And they heard a voice from heaven saying, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   pleased.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.480]   Hear him."
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.840]   So that Peter, later on in life, was able to say that he had heard the voice on the
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.600]   holy mount when they saw him.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.400]   John, again writing in the first chapter of his gospel, says, "We beheld his glory.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.840]   The glory is of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.320]   We've seen it.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.120]   That's the glory of his person.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.400]   But wait a minute, my friend.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:58.120]   Look for a moment at the glory of what he's done, what he did.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   What did he do?
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.840]   Well, this is it.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.800]   This person is the eternal Son of God.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.640]   He was with God from eternity.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:18.040]   It was through him that everything was made, the clouds, the constellations, everything.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.760]   All was made by him.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.120]   Everything consists by him.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:30.600]   But this is the message, and this is the glory of it all, the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.320]   Oh, can you?
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.320]   I defy you.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   Listen.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.640]   Do you know anything more wonderful, more glorious than this?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.020]   Have you ever heard anything that can compare with it?
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.880]   This is the thing that happened.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.280]   He who was in the bosom of the Father, God from eternity, and equal with God and sharing
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:57.440]   glory with God, away in the infinities of glory, he came out of that glory.
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.560]   He entered into this world of time.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   Perhaps this babe in Bethlehem, in the manger, looks like a little helpless babe, but no.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   He's the one through whom everything was made, veiled in flesh.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:27.480]   The Godhead see, hail incarnate deity, says Charles Wesley, and he says it rightly.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.720]   But think of the glory involved in all that.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:37.400]   Here is one, you see, who, though he is eternal in all his glory, as the apostle Paul reminded
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.920]   us in that second chapter of Philippians, laid aside the marks of the glory.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.120]   He has made himself of no reputation.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.020]   Now, sometimes you hear of something wonderful done by a man, and you say, "What a glorious
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.560]   thing to have done.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   Isn't that tremendous?
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.000]   A great act of self-sacrifice."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.100]   Oh, how the dramatists like to hear of a story like that.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.600]   Something to thrill people.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   What a glorious thing to do, a man sacrificing himself.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.880]   But listen, here is the eternal Son of God.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.040]   And he thought it not robbery to be equal with God, which means this.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.440]   He didn't hold on to it as his prerogative.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440]   He didn't say, "No, no.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   I'm not going to leave this."
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   He said, "I'll leave it all.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.920]   I'll go down to earth."
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.200]   He was born as a babe.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   He came in the likeness of man.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.560]   Indeed, he came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.280]   This, I say, is the most marvelous and glorious thing.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:40.040]   "Great is the mystery of godliness," says Paul on another occasion.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:47.720]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.560]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.080]   Yes, he humbled himself.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.380]   He made himself of no reputation.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.040]   He came down amongst us.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.180]   He lived amongst men and women.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.700]   He submitted himself to his parents, so-called, his mother and her husband, Joseph.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.520]   He put himself under the law.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]   He was pure.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   He'd never sinned.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   He didn't want to.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.080]   But he put himself under the law like other men and women.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.800]   He submitted to John the Baptist, asking him to baptize him.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.040]   He lived a life in this world of suffering, a life of shame, a life of mocking, a life
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   of laughter and ridicule against him.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:36.280]   Not only that, I see men arresting him, buffeting him, putting him on trial in a court and charging
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.420]   him with things he's never done.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.640]   He submits to it all.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.000]   He's led like a lamb to the slaughter.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.360]   I see them making a crown out of thorns and thrusting it on his head until blood spouts
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.800]   out of his holy brow.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.320]   I see them scourging him.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.520]   I see them making him carry a cross that was too heavy for him to carry, that he staggered
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.400]   beneath it.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.880]   I see them nailing him to that cross, and there they mock at him and jeer at him and
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   laugh at him.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.840]   The mob, the crowd, ridiculing him and saying, "If thou be the Son of God, come down and
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.720]   save thyself."
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.200]   I see him dying on that cross.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.360]   I see them taking down his body and wrapping it in clothes and putting it in a grave and
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.560]   rolling a stone over that grave and sealing it, putting soldiers to guard it, and saying,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.960]   "That's the end of him, no more of this nonsense, this Son of God, blasphemy, there's the end."
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.920]   But you know he didn't stop there, he rose again, there was an empty grave.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.520]   He came out of it, he manifested himself to certain chosen followers, and he ascended
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.000]   as they stood watching him.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.840]   He went up into the heavens, and there he returned to the everlasting glory.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   Do you know anything about the glory of what he's done?
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:11.360]   The gospel of the glory of Christ, the glory of the self-abasement, the self-humiliation,
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:19.960]   the glory of the incarnation, the life lived, the death, the burial, the resurrection.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.480]   The glory of Christ.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.280]   Why did he do all that?
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.880]   And here is perhaps the most glorious thing of all.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:38.720]   He did that, my friends, because you and I, to use the apostles' term, were lost.
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.880]   He did it because we were damned, because we were hopeless, because we couldn't save
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.760]   ourselves, because there was nothing but hell awaiting us all.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   He came and did all that.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.120]   In order to save us.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.160]   And he did it, remember, though we had rebelled against him and his father, though we'd all
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:07.640]   turned our backs against him and his father, though we'd all arrogantly turned our backs
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:15.500]   and spat into his face, as it were, in spite of us and what we've done.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.940]   He came down from heaven to earth and was born as a helpless babe and lived that kind
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:28.220]   of life and died that horrible, cruel death.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   What for?
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   Well, to redeem us, to save us against ourselves and from ourselves and from the punishment
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.500]   that would so definitely come upon us.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   Glory!
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   Have you seen it?
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.060]   Is there anything comparable to it?
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.940]   Is there anything anywhere that you can put by the side of it?
[00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:52.500]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.820]   I count but loss and paw contempt on all my pride.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:04.780]   You dramatists, you theatre, cinema people, you who like to see some great dramatic enactment,
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.580]   have you seen this?
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.980]   The glory of what he's done?
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:15.300]   But wait a minute, have a glance at the glory of his present position and what he's doing
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.300]   now.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   What's that, you say?
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.420]   Oh, I can tell you.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   He's there, this Jesus of Nazareth that walked the face of this earth and who died and who
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:31.980]   was buried and who rose again and ascended, do you know where he is?
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:38.820]   He is seated at the right hand of God in heaven in the glory at this very minute.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.000]   That's the glory of his position?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.620]   I'll tell you more.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.740]   This is what he said himself to his followers, it's the last thing he ever said to them.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.060]   I know of nothing more comforting in this troubled world tonight than this.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.060]   These are his very words.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:38:00.100]   Let me give you them exactly once more.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:07.820]   Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, this was after his resurrection, remember, "All
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:17.700]   power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.700]   And that is true this evening.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:24.940]   He is the Lord of the universe, Paul says here.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:33.660]   He says we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord.
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.180]   He's the Lord of the universe.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.740]   He made it, yes, and he's the Lord of the universe at this very moment.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.020]   He is ruling.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.020]   He is reigning.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.300]   Ah, then you say, if that is so, why is the world as it is?
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.460]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:58.640]   He is simply waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.340]   He's got power over everything, yes, but it has pleased him and the Father in their eternal
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.980]   wisdom to allow certain things to happen.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.140]   You see, they know us very well, and they know the sort of thing we like to say, and
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.500]   what we like to say is this, they say, "Give us a chance and we'll put our world in order."
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.820]   Well, now, for nearly 2,000 years since he was in this world and since he's been there
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.380]   seated at the right hand of God, he's been giving us a chance to put our world in order.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:29.820]   We clever men, we men who know a thing or two, we men who don't need God and don't need
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.340]   his help, we with our ability and our knowledge, our philosophy and our politics, we are going
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.540]   to put the world right.
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:41.980]   He's allowing us to do it.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.900]   So that when the end comes, you see, and we find we not only can't do it but that we've
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:52.220]   been reducing it again to chaos and made another mess of it, we shan't be able to plead the
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.660]   excuse that we were not given a chance.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.340]   You see, if you say you can save yourself, why don't you?
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.800]   If you say you can live the Sermon on the Mount, well, why don't you get on with it?
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.440]   If you say you can know God without Christ, well, why don't you know him?
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.540]   If you can find peace and happiness without Christ, why haven't you got it?
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.620]   If you can put the world in order with all your great statesmen and men, why don't you
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.900]   do it?
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:24.860]   He's just giving us the chance we say we ought to have.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.300]   So that when in the end he judges us, we won't have a word to utter.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.180]   We'll be absolutely silenced.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.060]   We'll be rendered speechless.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.740]   "All power is given unto me."
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.420]   Believe it or not, my friend, this is a fact.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:42.660]   The world tonight is in the hands of the Son of God.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:43.660]   He's ruling it.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.900]   He's reigning over it.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.380]   He's looking after his people.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.140]   He's giving them blessings.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.540]   He can use everything in order to bless them.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.180]   All power is in his hands.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:03.940]   And there he is, seated at the right hand of God, the Jesus who was despised by men,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:09.420]   the Jesus whom the princes of this world didn't know, the Jesus of whom they said, "Away
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.420]   with him.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.420]   Crucify him.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.220]   Make a robber Barabbas instead."
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.380]   He's seated on the throne of the universe.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.100]   Time and history and everything are in his hands.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.540]   It's a wonderful thought, this.
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.420]   Yes, but that's not the end of it.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:36.340]   The last thing I want to talk about is the glory of his future coming, because he is
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:42.220]   waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:51.420]   There's a day coming, my friend, when this same Christ, this same Jesus of Nazareth will
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:42:03.240]   be seen coming on the clouds of heaven, surrounded by a host of holy angels in glory indescribable.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.240]   What will he be doing?
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.020]   He'll be coming to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.620]   God, the Father, has handed over judgment to him.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.880]   He's given the Son this great privilege.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:20.620]   He says, "You are to be the judge of it all, and he'll come in his glory with all the regalia,
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.300]   with all the insignia of his everlasting glory.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:33.180]   And every eye shall see him, and you and I shall see him."
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:39.220]   The brightness of his coming, the glory of his coming.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:42.500]   And he will come, I say, to judge the whole world.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.180]   He'll judge the nations, he'll judge individuals.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:52.180]   He will make a final pronouncement, and some will go with him to glory, others will go
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:55.700]   to punishment and everlasting perdition.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.580]   He will be the one who will promulgate the sentence.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.540]   It will be his glory to do so.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.740]   Oh, what a sight!
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.500]   You read about people in India at the present time waiting for us to see the Queen and the
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   Duke of Edinburgh.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:17.260]   Why, well, the pomp and the ceremony and the glory of it all, a reigning monarch.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.340]   And they'll go and look at anything that is glorious and wonderful.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:28.300]   My friend, you and I are going to see something which makes all this pale into insignificance.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:37.940]   We will see one coming who is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.980]   There is a day coming when, at the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow of things in heaven
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:48.020]   and things on earth and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:54.420]   Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.900]   The brightness of his coming, the glory of his coming.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.900]   And it will happen.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.500]   He will come.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.740]   He came, he'll come again, not this time as a babe in helplessness, but as this mighty
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:17.780]   conqueror, this King, supreme, universal, the Judge of the whole earth.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:26.380]   That's what the gospel is, the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.300]   I've been putting facts before you.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.500]   He was in eternity, he came into time, he's gone back, he's there, he's coming again.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.780]   These are facts, these are not theories, these are not fantasies, these are solemn, simple
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.980]   facts.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:51.020]   The Son of God has been in this world, and he's coming into it again.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:59.580]   Now then, here's my question as I leave you.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:05.180]   Had you realized the glory of Christ?
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.940]   What does all this mean to you?
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.660]   Does it mean anything?
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:16.060]   It is the most glorious thing that has ever happened, or ever can happen.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.780]   As Isaac Watts put it in that last hymn, the glory of the creation, which was very wonderful,
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.620]   was nothing in comparison with this.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.540]   It is here, you rarely see it.
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.620]   But now let me ask a question, have you seen this?
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:37.120]   Have you realized the glory of Christ?
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.020]   Have you realized this good news concerning the fact that the Son of God, the image of
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   God has been into this world, and has done all this, and has done it in order to save
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   men?
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.380]   Save them not only in time, but save them for all eternity.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.220]   Have you realized it?
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:00.460]   Can't you see, my dear friend, that if this is not to you the most glorious thing that's
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.620]   ever happened, the most glorious and the most wonderful thing that you've ever heard, there's
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.300]   only one explanation, you're absolutely blind.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.900]   You're deaf, you can't see.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:15.500]   You're like a man standing before the most glorious portrait, but he's blind, he can
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   see nothing.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.620]   He says, "I see what they're shouting about, what they're getting excited by, I see nothing."
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:20.620]   Of course he doesn't.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:27.020]   It doesn't mean there's nothing there, but it does mean that he can't see.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.940]   You know, it isn't drunkenness and adultery and things like that that primarily matter.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.380]   That isn't what makes a man a sinner.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.580]   Do you know what makes a man a sinner?
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:41.740]   It's this, that he doesn't see and know the glory of Christ.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:54.900]   God has so loved the world that he has already sent his only begotten Son into it, that whosoever
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:02.420]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.700]   This incredible, amazing thing has already taken place.
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:12.860]   God, the everlasting Son, has come into the world as that helpless babe in Bethlehem.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:20.620]   He's suffered all this, he's died on the cross, he's been buried, he's risen in order to save.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.620]   Does it mean nothing to you?
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:31.900]   What a terrible state to be in, that all this, the glory of God and the glory of the Lord
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:38.020]   Jesus Christ, means nothing at all to you, my dear friend.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.460]   You know, that's hell, and if you die like that, you'll be in hell for all eternity,
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:49.500]   missing the wonderful, the glorious, this most marvelous thing, this amazing thing.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:55.940]   But me, the men like Isaac Watts, say we're the whole realm of nature, mine.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:06.060]   That's where an offering far too small, love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.460]   life, my all.
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.940]   Tell me, does this thing move you?
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.820]   If not, I'll tell you the truth about yourself, you're dead.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:18.460]   If you're not moved by this, if you're not thrilled by it, if you don't feel it's more
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:25.700]   important than everything, you are just plain dead.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.660]   You're not alive spiritually.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:34.260]   And if you die like that, you'll go to hell, and you'll remain dead, miserable, unhappy,
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:35.780]   much worse than it is now.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.940]   It'll be much worse there, because you'll know, you see, what you've missed.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:45.020]   Because you've got to see him, every eye shall see him, yea, and they that even pierced him.
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:50.380]   Every great and small will see him in all his majesty and his glory.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:56.540]   And then they'll realize too late what they've missed and what they never saw.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.380]   The gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.580]   Have you seen the glory of the facts?
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.820]   Well, all I want to say is this, if you haven't.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:12.460]   Realize it means you're lost, that you're damned, that you're dead, and cry out unto
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.420]   God for mercy and compassion.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   Ask him to give you sight.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.860]   Say, "I'm blind, Lord, I can't see it.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.860]   I wish I could.
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.620]   I've heard that, but I see nothing in it."
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:22.620]   Tell him that.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.620]   Confess it to him.
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.140]   Acknowledge your blindness, your deadness, your utter darkness.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:28.500]   Ask him to open your eyes.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.920]   Ask him to give you life.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.660]   Ask him to give you understanding.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:39.060]   Ask him to give you appreciation, and he'll give it to you.
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.900]   But oh, I plead with you, face it.
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.500]   It isn't what happens tonight or tomorrow or the next month or two or the next year
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:53.620]   or two that matters, it's your eternal destiny, my dear friend.
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:59.260]   And you know, if you but realize the truth of this gospel concerning the glory of Christ,
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:05.300]   if you but come to see and believe that he did all that for you, that the Son of God
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:11.860]   loved you and gave himself for you, that he came from heaven and left aside all the robes
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:17.940]   of the glory and the marble of all the insignia and humbled himself and made himself of no
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:25.220]   reputation and went even to the death of the cross for you, you know, once you see it,
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.940]   once you know it, you'll be absolutely different.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.980]   You'll be a new man in a new world.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.820]   You'll have a new nature, a new everything, and you'll glory in him, and you'll say, "Let
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:42.680]   nothing please nor pain me apart, oh Lord, from thee."
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:56.100]   The gospel of the glory of Christ, the glory of his person, the glory of what he's done,
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:04.780]   his glory at this moment seated at the right hand of God, ruling, reigning over the universe,
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.620]   the glory of his coming.
[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:16.940]   And the most wonderful thing of all, I think, the glory of that hour when I shall look into
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:27.420]   his face and see him as he is, not in a glass dartly any longer, but as he is, to look into
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:33.680]   the eyes of the Son of God who loved me and died for me, to see the love pouring out of
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:43.380]   him everlastingly and to spend my whole eternal future looking at him and enjoying him and
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:53.620]   being with him forever and forever, the gospel of the glory of Christ.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.860]   Amen.
