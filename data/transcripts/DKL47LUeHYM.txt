[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020]   There is no company where I have majority control where I have an HR department, you
[00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.680]   should go to a very respected lawyer at a third party firm, someone very visible so
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.500]   that you have an escape valve.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.980]   If there are any kind of serious issues that need to be escalated, the team should build
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.080]   their own benefits package that they want.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   Then when it comes to hiring the person for whom that person will end up working for,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.340]   it's the head of engineering, it's the head of sales, those are the people that should
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.600]   be running the hiring processes.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.920]   When you strip all of these jobs away, HR doesn't have a role.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.680]   And what is left over is the very dark part of HR in most organizations, which is the
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680]   police person, what is Saks called the commissar.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.720]   That is why everybody hates HR.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.680]   They are this conflict creating entity inside of an organization that slows organizations
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   down.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.680]   It's not required.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   And I think people are realizing like, why would you create this large bureaucracy in
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.920]   the company that undercuts the meritocracy that adds a lot of costs, and that slows you
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.920]   down?
