[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.640]   found in the Gospel according to Saint John in the first chapter verses 17 and
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.360]   18. Verses 17 and 18 in the first chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.480]   For the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.760]   hath seen God at any time. The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.280]   the Father he hath declared. We continue really with our study of the 17th verse
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.840]   but the 18th verse as I hope to show you is a kind of explanation of the latter
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.160]   portion of the 17th. We have spent our time in contrasting the law and grace, Moses
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.000]   and the Lord Jesus Christ in terms of the contrast between the law and grace.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.800]   But you notice that there is a further contrast in this verse. The law was given
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.880]   by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. So that there is obviously a
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.880]   comparison and a contrast also between the law and truth in exactly the same
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.440]   way as we have seen between law and grace. So now we come to work out this
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.000]   contrast and comparison between these two or between Moses and the Lord Jesus
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.400]   Christ even as we have been doing in that other respect. Now it's very
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.320]   important once more that we should bear in mind that John puts it like this not
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   to disparage the law, not to disparage Moses, but simply in order to show the
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.080]   superiority of grace and truth and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I keep on repeating
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.560]   this because I am well aware of the fact that so many think that now that we are
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   in the Christian dispensation that we are to disparage law and to dismiss it,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.760]   that we are never to preach it, that it doesn't come in at all. I think we've
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.320]   seen abundantly the error of any such teaching. But John himself is very
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.440]   careful to prevent our doing this. For instance in chapter 5 in verse 39 he
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.880]   says, "Search the Scriptures," or you do search the Scriptures, whichever you
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   prefer, it doesn't matter. "For in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.360]   they which testify of me." He's referring there of course to the Old Testament
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   Scriptures and indicates clearly that they referred to him and testified of
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.320]   him. But our Lord later puts it still more clearly in the 46th verse. He says,
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.240]   "For had you believed Moses you would have believed me, for he wrote of me."
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.240]   Therefore it is obviously and of necessity wrong ever to speak
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.200]   disparagingly of Moses and the teaching of the law. That is not what the idea of
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.680]   this verse at all. It is not to dismiss as useless the law. It is just to show
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.520]   that the law, though it was given by God and though it was given in a very
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.120]   glorious manner, was nevertheless incomplete. It was not perfect. It lacked
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.640]   the fullness which are to be found in our Lord Jesus Christ alone. Now that is
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.800]   the way in the spirit in which John writes these words. The law was given by
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.560]   God. It was given, I say, in a very glorious manner. It had a specific work
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.960]   to do. It did that work. But nevertheless it was only preparatory. And it was only
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.760]   preparatory in the matter of truth, as we have already seen that it was only
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.360]   preparatory in the matter of grace. And what we are now going to proceed to do
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:27.200]   is to show the ways and the respects in which the law was incomplete when you
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   put it by the side of what has come in its fullness in and through our blessed
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.280]   Lord and Savior. Now it seems to me we can best divide this matter by looking
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.320]   at it like this. The law was incomplete and imperfect in the matter of truth and
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.760]   in the matter of revealing truth in a general way. And then we shall look at it
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   as it was incomplete in one particular respect, which is of course the most
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.960]   important respect of all at the same time. But now first of all, I say, let us
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.680]   look at the general incompleteness and insufficiency and lack of fullness of
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   the law regarded from the standpoint of truth. And this is something which is
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.800]   adverted to very frequently in the New Testament itself and which is made quite
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.440]   plain here, for instance, is one respect in which we see its incompleteness. That
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.960]   the truth that is conveyed to us by the law was done in terms of types and of
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.440]   shadows. Now these are the terms that are used in the New Testament itself in order
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.320]   to bring out this aspect of the truth. And it's very remarkable to notice the
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.600]   terminology which is implied by the New Testament writers in bringing out this
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.160]   aspect of the matter. Take for instance what the Apostle Paul says in
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.480]   Colossians 2 and verse 17. He is talking about things like this, "Let no man
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.440]   new moon or of the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come." That's the
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.800]   word, "which are a shadow of things to come, but the body," he says, "is of Christ." So the
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.720]   difference between the two is the difference between a type or a shadow
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.920]   and the one hand, the body, the substance, the reality on the other. But let me give
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.240]   you some further examples of this kind of statement. Take Hebrews chapter 8 and
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.520]   verse 5, for instance. Here again he is showing the contrast and the difference
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.160]   between the two covenants, even their administration and everything. He says,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.600]   "If our Lord were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   that offer gifts according to the law, who serve unto the example and shadow of
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.800]   heavenly things. As Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.360]   tabernacle, for see, said he, that thou make all things according to the pattern
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.520]   shown to thee on the mount." But here's the tone. They're but examples and shadows of
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.440]   the heavenly things, not the reality itself, in other words. You get the same
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   thing in Hebrews 9, verses 9 and 10, where he says that everything that
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.040]   happened under the law in the first tabernacle was a figure for the time then
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.140]   present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.360]   that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience which stood
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.840]   only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances, imposed
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:59.320]   on them until the time of Reformation. It was temporary, it was transient, it was
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   just a matter of types and illustrations and shadows, and not the great reality
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.640]   itself. And then you've got a further statement in Hebrews 10, verse 1, "For the
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:17.400]   law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.240]   things." Now there it is most explicitly. It had merely the shadow of these things
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.400]   which were to come, these good things, not the very image, can never with those
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.600]   perfect. Now then, here is an important difference, and that is really the
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.360]   exposition of John 1 17. Law was given by Moses, truth by Jesus Christ.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.920]   You see, it is the difference between a picture or a hint or an illustration, and
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:09:01.480]   the truth itself. Everything under the law was a mere representation. It wasn't
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:09.640]   the thing itself, and that is wherein lay its real limit. "It is impossible," says
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   Hebrews again 10, "for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.480]   should take away sin." They were never meant to, they couldn't. They were but
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.880]   pictures and representations, shadows, adumbrations, anticipations. Ah, that which
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.680]   was to come in its fullness in and through our Lord and Savior himself. Very
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:40.000]   well, that's the first thing. They were but the shadows and the types. He is the
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.240]   great anti-type himself. He is the truth. He is the substance, or to use this
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:56.920]   language, he is the body. He is the reality itself that was thus hinted at
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:05.440]   and pointed to by the types and the shadows and the adumbrations. So that the
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.360]   New Testament ever refers to him as the truth, and he does so himself, "I am the
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.640]   way, the truth, and the life." He is the light of the world. He is the incarnation
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   of truth. He is in and of himself the truth. And perhaps we can best fix this
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.560]   in our minds by reminding ourselves of the language used by John the Baptist,
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.160]   which is going to be quoted later on in this first chapter of the Gospel
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:42.360]   according to St. John. Verse 29, "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:53.080]   saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." Now here is
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.560]   the difference, you see. It's no longer the case of the lambs provided by men.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.960]   They provided one morning and evening, and there was the Paschal Lamb, and so on.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.720]   Yes, these are the lambs of men, as it were, but they're only pictures, they're
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   only illustrations. Here is the Lamb, pointed to by all the others, and the
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.720]   Lamb of God himself, the Lamb that God is providing. And not merely to cover over
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.280]   sins as those others did, their blood merely covered over sins for the time
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:29.960]   being, until the time of Reformation should come, the time of Reformation has
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:37.880]   come. Here is the Lamb of God that really does take away the sin of the world. That
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.840]   is what John the Baptist is proclaiming. Very well, then, so that the contrast here
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.360]   is, the truth conveyed through the law was a matter of hints and glimpses and
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:55.720]   suggestions, but now the truth has arrived in all its fullness and in all
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:02.760]   its glory, in the person of God's Son. But let me hurry to a second way in which we
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.080]   see the incompleteness of the law and the fullness that is in Christ. The author of
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.640]   the epistle to the Hebrews starts off his great letter, you remember, by saying
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:18.520]   this, "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:25.120]   the fathers by the prophets." He says, "God in the past revealed the truth to the
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.720]   fathers through the prophets at sundry times and in diverse manners, if you like,
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:38.600]   in many parts and in many ways, in many portions and in many ways." And how true
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   that is. What you have in the New Testament is a little bit here and a
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.240]   little bit there. That's its characteristic. You see, the whole thing
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   is incomplete. It's very interesting at this Advent time to look at the truth
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.120]   and the prophecies concerning our Lord in that very way, and to see how an
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.000]   aspect was given here and another aspect there, the place he should be born in, the
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   time when he should come, certain things that were going to happen, and various
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   other details. Sundry times, diverse manners, one man given this bit, another
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.000]   man given that bit. Now that's the whole characteristic of the law. Taking the law
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.920]   to cover here the whole of the Old Testament, Moses and the prophets. There
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.000]   it is, all of them together, even putting the prophets in with the law. We see that
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.640]   that was its characteristic. And there is another very important and vital
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:51.160]   difference. Our Lord himself is the truth. In him, says the apostle again in
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   writing to those Colossians, God has treasured up for us, "In whom are hid all
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:06.720]   the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." It's all in the person of our blessed
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.000]   Lord and Savior. It isn't just a hint, it isn't just this little aspect or that
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.520]   aspect. He is the truth. He is the light of the world. There is nothing incomplete.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:24.400]   It is the truth in all its fullness. No longer parts and portions, bits and pieces,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:33.560]   but the entire, the whole, the complete truth in this one person. Very well.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.160]   There's another contrast. Let's look at another. What you have really in the Old
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   Testament is promises. They're very wonderful promises. They are indeed
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.560]   exceeding great and precious promises. And God went on giving his people these
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.800]   promises from the very beginning, starting in the Garden of Eden in
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.400]   Genesis 3 15. He went on giving promises, and they lived by the promises, and they
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.600]   looked forward. Yes, but it was never more than the promise. That is the astounding
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.640]   thing. It's the thing we as Christian people should always be bearing in our
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:15.000]   minds. Listen to the way the author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts this. He
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.520]   gives this gallery of the great saints of the Old Testament in chapter 11. He
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.320]   says, "And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.160]   the promise." They didn't receive the promise. What he means by that is, they
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.840]   didn't receive the fulfillment of the promise. They had nothing but the promise.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.880]   They didn't have the thing to which the promise was pointing, God having provided
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.600]   some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.480]   Very well, then, they were left merely with the promise, the hope, the
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.360]   possibility, and they held on to it. That's the meaning of faith. It is the
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.320]   substance of these things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. But we
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.220]   believed them because they received the promises, and they lived by them. But it
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:06.800]   never got beyond them. That is where it is right to say the law was given by
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:13.120]   Moses, but grace and truth have come through our Lord Jesus Christ. How? Well,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:20.600]   let the Apostle Paul again put that in his own way. "All the promises of God in
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   him are yea, and in him are men, to the glory of God the Father." He is the
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:36.000]   fulfillment of every single promise. Go through your Old Testament, make a list
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.040]   of every single promise, you'll find he's the fulfillment, the answer to every
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:47.240]   single one of them. The promises have been fulfilled. That's the difference. You
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.640]   see, under the law, through Moses, great as it was, given by God with glory,
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.320]   nevertheless, it's only the promise, the possibility, the hope, it's arrived. All
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:04.400]   the promises of him, of God in him are yea, and in him are men, to the glory of God
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   the Father. And the last difference that I would indicate, we'll
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.640]   put in this way. It is indeed the contrast between Moses himself and our
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.240]   blessed Lord and Savior. It's interesting the way John puts this. Have you been
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:31.120]   noticing it from Sunday to Sunday? The law was given by Moses. Two things, law,
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:38.720]   Moses. Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. So there's a comparison, not only
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.360]   between the law and grace and truth, a comparison between Moses and the Lord
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.520]   Jesus Christ. And that's done quite deliberately, because it does help to
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.800]   bring out this pre-eminence, superiority, perfection, completeness that is in the
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.680]   New Testament gospel. In other words, I say the contrast in this whole matter of
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.360]   truth can be put very well in terms of the contrast between Moses and the Lord
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:11.240]   himself. What is it? Well, let us again allow the epistle to the Hebrews to
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.360]   answer the question for us. You know, if you know how to use your Bible, you won't
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.120]   need so many commentaries. The Bible's the best commentary on the Bible.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.800]   Listen to Hebrews 3, beginning at verse 1. "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.480]   the heavenly calling, consider the apostle and high priest of our profession,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.760]   Christ Jesus, who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.480]   faithful in all his house. For this man was counted worthy of more glory than
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.560]   Moses, inasmuch as he that builded the house hath more honor than the house.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.400]   For every house is built by some men, but he that built all things is God. And
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.040]   Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.000]   those things which were to be spoken after. But Christ, as a son over his own
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.340]   house, whose house are we, if we hold fast with the confidence and the
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:18.720]   rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the end." Well, now there you see is the full
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.560]   statement with regard to this matter. What's the difference? Well, it's this.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.000]   The difference between Moses and our Lord is the difference between a house
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.400]   and the builder of the house. You see, when you say that the builder of the
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.880]   house is superior to the house, you're not making fun of the house, are you?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   You're not saying the house is useless? You're not dismissing the house? You're
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.520]   not saying it's worthless? Of course you're not. You see, it is a relative
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.800]   difference. It's a relative greatness. The law is God's law, and it's still there,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.960]   but we have something greater. That's what John is saying, and it is the
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.160]   difference thus between the house and the one who had the mind and the
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.080]   understanding and the ingenuity, was able to plan and produce his specifications,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:13.440]   the creator, the architect, the artificer, the builder. That's the difference. But a
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:19.680]   second way he puts it is this. He says it is the difference between a servant and
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:30.480]   a son. Moses, great man though he was, was only a servant, and the greatest servant
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.840]   is inferior to the son, even when the son is a babe. That's the difference. Moses
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   stands out preeminently as the great servant in the Old Testament. Yes, but
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   what is a servant? I say, on tiptoe and in the moment of his greatest exaltation,
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.640]   when you put him by the side of the son. And this son happens to be the maker of
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.440]   all things, and therefore God. Every house is built by some men, but he that built
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:03.480]   all things is God. He's already said that about the son in the first chapter.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   "Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:15.120]   things, by whom also he made the world." So here, you see, is a second way of
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.240]   looking at it. What we have received through Moses is what we receive through
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.120]   a servant. What we receive through the Lord Jesus Christ is that which we
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.800]   receive through the Son of God himself. Well, here it is. The only begotten Son
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.080]   who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. And the last way in
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.720]   which the epistle to the Hebrews works out the contrast is this. It is the
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:46.000]   difference between a testimony to the truth, or a teaching about the truth, and
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   the truth itself. Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.840]   for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after. He couldn't go
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:03.440]   beyond that. He is a pointer, he is a testimony, he is a witness. He points us
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.680]   in the direction, he says, "The truth is going to come." But he couldn't do more than that.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:16.880]   He is a testimony. In our Lord we have the truth itself, in all its fullness. He
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.600]   is the truth. As I've reminded you, he proclaimed on more than one occasion,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.760]   "He's the light of the world." Or as John puts it here in this prorogue, "He is the
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.600]   light that lighteth every man coming into the world." Well now, then, there is
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.440]   the general difference which is indicated by our text this morning. The
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:44.760]   law was given by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. Looking at it in a
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.200]   general way, a kind of general examination, we see that there is this
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.560]   essential difference between the two. But now let us hurry to the particular
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   application. For obviously that's the thing that John has got in his mind. When
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.800]   he talks about truth, he says, "I'm really talking about the truth concerning God."
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.400]   The law was given by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man has
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   seen God at any time. The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father,
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:21.920]   he hath declared it. So the particular application is with regard to this whole
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:28.440]   matter of the truth concerning God. That is ultimate truth. That is really what we
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:35.160]   mean by truth. It is the knowledge of God. And here's the thing about which John is
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:42.120]   rejoicing. This is why he indulges in this comparison. He says, "At last it is
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.000]   possible for us to have this knowledge." So he starts by saying, "No man hath seen
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.760]   God at any time." Now when he puts it like that, he's not referring only to seeing
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:59.440]   God with a visible eye. It includes that, but it means more than that. He's not
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.400]   merely saying that no man has actually seen the form or the shape of God,
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:10.720]   because God is spirit. That's included, but he goes beyond. He says, "No man rarely has
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:19.320]   any true knowledge of God." Seeing in that sense, as we say in our ordinary common
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.920]   parlance, when somebody tells us something, we say, "I don't see that." When you say, "I don't
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.080]   see that," you mean, "I don't understand it, I don't comprehend it, I don't follow. I'm not
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.160]   with you. I don't quite get what you're saying." Now that's included here also.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:37.800]   No man hath seen God. No man hath ever seen the truth about God in its fullness.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.520]   It's impossible. It's a fact, and it's something which is impossible also. Now
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:54.200]   here this contrast with Moses is a particularly helpful one, and it brings
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:01.040]   out this aspect of the truth in a very glorious manner, because Moses came
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:12.520]   nearer to seeing God in every respect than anybody else. Now the philosophers,
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:19.920]   they haven't come anywhere near it. The philosophers simply speculate. They don't
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.360]   know anything. They know nothing at all. Isn't that an exaggeration? No, it isn't.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.640]   The philosophers know nothing about God. How can they? There is a limit to their
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.520]   capacity. God is infinite. The philosophers but speculate. They say
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.000]   what they think. They think that they can deduce certain things, but they've no
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.800]   authority, they've no sanction whatsoever for it. All that is but a
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.760]   groping after the truth, seeking it happily. They might seek after him and
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:55.000]   find him. That's all they could do, as Paul told the Athenians, and it's as true
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.760]   today as it was then. That is why we should pay no attention at all to what
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.760]   any philosopher who is not a Christian may say about God. It is useless. It is
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.360]   absolutely worthless. It is simply what he thinks. But he's a sinful man, he's a
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.680]   finite man, and by definition he's therefore incapable. And he is incapable.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.920]   That's why they change their ideas of their gods from time to time. And that is
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.120]   why you find them when they talk in these interviews on the television,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.000]   they're all contradicting one another. Why? Well, because none of them know. It
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.960]   all comes out of men. Buddhism, anything else you like, all the false religions,
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.360]   these are human philosophies, every one of them. And they're simply speculations
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   based upon nothing whatsoever except the opinion of mortal, fallible men. So that
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.480]   when you come to Moses, you're looking at somebody who's in an entire different
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.880]   category. Moses never sat down and began to write saying, "This is what I think,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.240]   this is what I say about God." That's not his position at all. Moses was a man who
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.560]   received a revelation. What did he receive? What truth was given to Moses?
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.720]   Well, the full answer is in the book of Exodus. First of all, Moses went up onto
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:21.160]   the mountain, there he received the law from God, as he received much else. There
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:27.480]   we are told that God spoke to Moses face to face, but be careful about that,
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.840]   because I'll show you in a moment that he didn't actually see the face of God,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.360]   that face to face is but an expression. What it means is that God spoke to Moses
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.560]   in a very intimate manner. God addressed Moses and Moses knew that God was
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.760]   speaking to him. He came into the presence of God, hence this radiance in
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.760]   his face, to which Paul refers in 2 Corinthians 3 that we read at the
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.560]   beginning. However, the point is that Moses was taken up onto the mount and
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:59.480]   there he was with God those 40 days, receiving the revelation, God giving him
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.240]   a knowledge of truth that he might impart it to the people. You see it
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.880]   perfectly in the Ten Commandments, but there was a great deal of information
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.040]   that was given in addition to that. Very well, here is something that puts Moses
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.120]   in a category on his own, not only Moses, but all the prophets of course. No
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.240]   prophecy of scripture has come by private interpretation, says 2 Peter 1
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.200]   20, but holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. This is
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.600]   revelation. Moses had it, I say, in this supreme manner. The prophets went into a
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.280]   kind of ecstasy, the divine aphlatus came upon them, but Moses was
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.520]   taken up onto the mount and there he spent the 40 days with God, face to face
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:49.400]   as it were, in that strange intimacy. But more than that was given to him. Take
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:56.680]   that extraordinary incident which is recorded in Exodus chapter 33 at the end,
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:04.920]   where Moses with that strange boldness makes his request, "Show me thy glory." And
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:13.320]   God answers him and says, "No, I can't do exactly what you ask of me. No man can see
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:21.240]   God and live the sight as more than any man can stand or can bear." However, he
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.600]   said, "Though that is not possible, I'll do this for you. I will make all my
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.440]   goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee,
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.560]   and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:42.000]   will show mercy. Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.560]   live." And then you remember God said to him, "There is a place by me, and thou
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.440]   shall stand upon a rock, and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by,
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.160]   that I will put thee in a cliff to the rock, and will cover thee with my hand
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:59.800]   while I pass by, and I will take away mine hand, and thou shall see my back
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:08.360]   pass, but my face shall not be seen." Now that was a remarkable and an
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.680]   extraordinary thing. Moses was given a glimpse of the glory of the
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.760]   incomprehensible God. Yes, but he just saw him passing by as it were the back
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:26.960]   parts of God. He didn't see the face of God. Oh, he saw the glory, there is no
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.600]   question of that. Not in the fullness of the expression of it, but the passing by,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:39.120]   the back parts, the mere hem of the glory of God as it were. Something unusual,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.080]   something extraordinary, something amazing. But Moses was given that revelation of
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.400]   the truth concerning God, yet, but you see the limitation, only the back parts.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:56.080]   And so he was never able to do more than, as I've said, than bear witness, bear
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.000]   testimony to the truth, and to point to it, and to repeat what he had been told
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.840]   in the great revelation. Now this is something that is true of the whole of
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.320]   the Old Testament. Our Lord says about Abram, "Abram rejoiced to see my day, and he
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:19.280]   saw it and was glad." Yes, but he only saw it afar off, remember? It's true of all
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.440]   these Old Testament characters. It's true of what we are told about God in the law.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.840]   In the law I see something of the character of God. I see his holiness, his
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.520]   righteousness, his justice. That's what I see supremely, and it caused men then to
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.120]   quake. It causes men to quake as we've seen even at this present time. This is
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.720]   true also of all the prophets. You remember the extraordinary phrase that
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.400]   the Apostle Peter uses with respect to this 1 Peter 1 10 to 12, of which
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.440]   salvation, "The prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.280]   grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of time the
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.920]   Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.000]   sufferings of Christ and the glory which would follow." In other words, these
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.240]   prophets, they were vehicles of the truth. God was giving truth through them, but
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.680]   they didn't understand it. They were inquiring, they were trying to understand
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.000]   when's it going to happen, what's going to happen, how is it going to happen.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Though they were giving the truth, they didn't understand it fully. They were
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.040]   amazed at it and were trying to grasp it. That's what we are told there about the
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:37.360]   prophets. Now that's true of Moses, it's true of all the prophets. And as our Lord
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.560]   himself says, it is true of John the Baptist, who was the last of the great
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.480]   line of prophets. Of John the Baptist, our Lord said, "Among them that is raised of
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.480]   women there is not a greater than John the Baptist." And yet you see the
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.680]   truth about John the Baptist is this. Well, we've got it here in this first
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:04.280]   chapter. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   witness, to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.040]   He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of the light. That's it. He
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.840]   can't go beyond it. We've got it again in verse 15. "John bear witness of him and
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:23.280]   cried saying, 'This was he of whom I speak. He that cometh after me is preferred
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.600]   before me, for he was before me.'" You see the limit? He can't go beyond it. But then
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.520]   our Lord puts it still more plainly, perhaps, in the fifth chapter, where he
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:42.680]   says this of John, "I have greater witness than John. He was a burning and a shining
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.880]   light, and he were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. But I have
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.760]   greater witness than that of John. For the works which the Father hath given me
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.920]   to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of me that the Father hath sent
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:05.840]   me." You sent unto John, and he bear witness unto the truth, says John 5.33.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:13.440]   Now there it is. All the Old Testament, all people like Moses the great lawgiver,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:19.480]   all the mighty succession of prophets, even the last, the forerunner, the herald,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:26.520]   John, simply witnesses to the truth. They've had a glimpse of the back parts, as it
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:32.520]   were, but no more. They give us valuable information. They teach us the truth
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.280]   concerning God in parts and portions, but they don't go beyond it. But now grace
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.000]   and truth have come through Jesus Christ. Or listen to the way he puts it here.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.480]   "No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the bosom
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.680]   of the Father, he hath declared him." Now there's great trouble about the
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.480]   translation here, and one can't settle it definitively or finally, but there is
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.560]   very good authority for saying it should be read like this. "No man hath seen God
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:14.520]   at any time, the only begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.840]   declared him." He's the only begotten. He's the only begotten God, for the Word was
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:27.400]   God. He is God, eternal God the Son. And then, in order to make it still more
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.520]   powerful, he says, "who is in the bosom of the Father." And to be in the bosom means
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:37.320]   an intimacy, it means that you receive the secrets. You tell things to people in
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.480]   your bosom that you don't tell the world. It's the nearness, the intimacy. He's in
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.560]   the bosom of the Father, he always has been. He knows. He's not someone far off.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.520]   Moses was taken unto the mount, yes, but you see, he's not allowed to be in the
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.960]   bosom. He was put in the cliff to the rock and the hand was upon him. He's not
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.000]   in the bosom of the Father. Here is one who's in the bosom of the Father. The
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.280]   only begotten, beloved Son of God, the intimate sharer of all the secrets of
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.920]   God from eternity to eternity, the one who knows everything. Well, now let me
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.280]   show you how our Lord went on saying this. Listen to the way he puts it to
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:18.800]   Nicodemus, chapter 3, beginning at verse 11. I'll take verse 10, "Jesus answered and
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   said unto him, 'Art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things? Verily,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   I say unto thee, we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen, and you
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:40.120]   receive not our witness.' Or take it like this in verse 13, 'No man hath ascended up
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.080]   to heaven, your great philosophers haven't ascended into heaven. They're
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.680]   earthbound, they're on the earth and they're of the earth earthy. Who can they,
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   who are they to speak about God? What do they know about God? The blasphemy of
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.160]   their speculations should be denounced by us. They've not ascended into heaven,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.120]   but God is in heaven and not on the earth. God is not a man who can be
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.840]   analyzed and dissected as they analyze one another's thoughts. No man hath
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.720]   ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:15.960]   which is in heaven." He's speaking on earth, but he's still in heaven. He's
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:20.220]   come from heaven, he's still in heaven. He's looked into the face of God, he's in
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:26.560]   the bosom of God. Here is the one who speaks with authority. And so we get
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.800]   later on in chapter 8 of this Gospel of John in verse 58 something like this,
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:39.480]   "Jesus said unto them, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abram was, I am."
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:44.000]   You're relying on Abram, you said. Abram's our father, you keep on saying. You say you
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   know a lot because you're Abram's children. Well, you do know a lot, of
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.040]   course. You know more than the Gentiles, but listen, "Before Abram was, I am." I always
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:38:02.280]   have been, I always will be. Or take it again in 10 John 30, "I and my father are
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:08.240]   one." There's nothing beyond that. But listen to this. This helps us perhaps
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   still more. Here he is, he's just been telling his disciples that he's going to
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.520]   leave them. And they were very troubled, they were very upset. He says, "Let not
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.480]   your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me," and so on. And then
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.780]   Philip, poor Philip, still not happy and satisfied, said, "Philip saith unto him,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:34.920]   'Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.'" Even though you are going, though we
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.680]   are troubled about your going. But though you are going, "Show us the Father, and
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.400]   we'll be satisfied. It is sufficient for us." "Jesus saith unto him, 'Have I been so
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.640]   long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?' He that hath seen me
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:59.040]   hath seen the Father. And thou sayest thou then, 'Show us the Father.'" The only
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:03.440]   begotten God who is in the bosom of the Father, "He hath declared him. He who hath seen
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:10.560]   me hath seen the Father." But come, let's go on. Let's listen to the apostle Paul
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:16.040]   trying to expound it. He who now has been made an apostle, that he might pass on
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.280]   the truth. This is how he puts it. Did you notice it in the reading at the
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.800]   beginning? 2 Corinthians 3, 18, "We all with open face, beholding as in a glass
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.920]   the glory of the Lord." I've changed into the same image from glory to glory,
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.080]   even as by the Spirit of the Lord. I'll take it again, his description of our
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.640]   Lord in 2 Corinthians 4, 4, "Lest the light of the glorious gospel of God,
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:49.200]   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, the
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.920]   express likeness of God, should shine unto us." But then, who is it that doesn't
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:01.960]   remember? 2 Corinthians 4, 6, "God who commanded the light to shine out of
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:10.360]   darkness, hath shined in our hearts." What for? Well, here's the answer. "To give the
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:20.000]   light of the knowledge of the glory of God." In the back part? No, no, in the face
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.200]   of Jesus Christ. No longer a glimpse of a passing glory, in the face of Jesus
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.280]   Christ. "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father." Well, you see what it means is
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.200]   this, without my keeping you. Again, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.960]   puts it in a most amazing statement. He talks about this Son in whom God has now
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:50.480]   spoken to us, who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:59.680]   person. There's nothing beyond that. He is the exact likeness, imprint, image of God
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:05.720]   himself. "It's all there in him. In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:11.680]   body." Very well, this is what John is saying. The law was given by Moses, but
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.040]   grace and the truth, the truth about God and the knowledge of God has come by
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.520]   Jesus Christ. "No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten God who is in the
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.920]   bosom of the Father. He hath exegeted him." He's expounded him. He's brought him
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.960]   forth. He's led him out to us. "In him we see him and in him we know him." In him we
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:38.400]   have a full expression of the glory of God. It is in him we know God and the
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.720]   character of God, the power of God, the glory of God, the love of God, the
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.920]   compassion of God, the long-suffering of God, the justice of God, the righteousness
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.600]   of God, the truth that is God. How does he do this? How does he exegete him? How does
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:42:01.920]   he declare him? Well, he declared him in his teaching. "Holy Father," he says, "lest men
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.360]   might have a sentimental notion of God's love. Our Father which art in him
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:12.960]   hallowed be thy name." And then, thank God, he taught us about the character of God
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.040]   in the parable of the prodigal son. The Pharisees thought they knew a great deal
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.480]   about God. They were students of the Old Testament scriptures, but they were
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.800]   blinded and they didn't understand God. So that when they see Christ mixing with
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.600]   publicans and sinners, they said, "This man's a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:35.000]   and sinners." "Oh," says our Lord, "you know nothing about God." So he speaks the parable
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.520]   of the prodigal son. He says that's what God's like. His son's become a prodigal,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.960]   he's become a publican, he's become a vice-lover. Nevertheless, the Father heart
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.360]   of God wants his child back. He's waiting for him, looking for him, runs to
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:56.640]   meet him and embrace him. That's God teaching. "He hath declared him." You don't find things like
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.120]   that in the Old Testament. Here is something that comes only from the Lord
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:07.240]   Jesus Christ himself, but then he does it in his life also. Look at his kindness,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:12.800]   his compassion. Look at his heart of love. Look at his readiness to stop, to heal
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.240]   some poor sufferer or somebody who was in trouble. He never despised anybody.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:23.080]   The bruised reed, he will not break. The smoking flax, he will not quench. He says,
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:29.380]   "That's how I am. That's how God is." Thus, you see, in his actions, in all his
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.880]   behavior and demeanor, he is revealing God. But, oh, above everywhere else, he
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.200]   reveals him on the cross. If you want to know anything about the justice and the
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.280]   holiness and the righteousness of God, go and look at the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:52.240]   But, thank God, you'll see at the same time the love, so amazing, so divine, and
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:57.520]   the compassion and the pity and the mercy. You'll see it all streaming from
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:03.720]   the face of Jesus Christ upon the cross. "He hath declared him." In his teaching,
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.160]   life and living, in his death, resurrection, in everything. Here is the
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.240]   full and the final revelation of God. But, above all, we see in him the truth about
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:21.840]   God with respect to God's wisdom, and especially in this matter of salvation.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:31.120]   We preach, "Jesus Christ and him crucified," says Paul. This is stumbling block to the
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:37.080]   Jews, it's foolishness to the Greeks, but we preach Christ crucified. Why? Well,
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:43.160]   because he is the power of God and the wisdom of God. Oh, in your Old Testament,
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.880]   I say, you can see hints of the way of salvation. I see the Paschal Lamb, it
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.600]   tells me something I don't understand, but God's going to provide some blood
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:55.000]   that's going to spare me. That's all, it's a picture. All right, I'll trust, but I
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.120]   don't see, I don't know. And so with all the types and shadows and prophecies. But
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.240]   when I come and look at him, Jesus Christ and him crucified, Paul says, "I'm
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.640]   preaching, I preach nothing to you in Corinth but this." Why? Well, here it all
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:13.960]   is. The way of salvation, justification by faith only, not my works, not my
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.720]   goodness. All we have seen in the past Sunday mornings, the law can't do, Christ
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:25.120]   has done, the fulfillment of it all in every respect, justification in Christ. Oh,
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.880]   let me put it in this quotation from 1 Corinthians 1.30, "But of him are ye in
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.400]   Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification,
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.560]   redemption." It's all there, in him. That's the wisdom of God. He's been made wisdom
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.000]   and there is the wisdom. Justification in Christ, sanctification in Christ, more.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.560]   Being in Christ, as I was in Adam, I am in Christ. The church is the body of Christ.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:53.360]   Did Moses teach that? Did the prophets teach that? Of course they didn't. They
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.160]   couldn't have done, but here it is in Christ. The truth has come in him, that
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:02.880]   I'm in him. He is, we are the body of Christ and members in particular, he is
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.040]   the head and we are merely parts and portions. Not only that, it's in him we
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.360]   see God's great plan and purpose for all the ages. Listen to Ephesians 1.10, "That in
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.800]   the dispensation of the fullness of times God might gather together in one
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:23.520]   all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.920]   him." He alone reveals this. It was never clearly seen before. There are hints,
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:34.000]   there are suggestions, but here it is stated fully and explicitly and openly.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.680]   Very well, I end by putting it to you like this. Our Lord, you remember, said, "I am the
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:51.800]   way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me." No man. You
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.640]   can't come to the Father except by Christ. Oh, you can arrive at partial
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:00.800]   knowledge of God along other ways, the law, Moses and so on, but you'll never
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.240]   know him as your Father. You may know him as the great creator, you may know him as
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.360]   the great judge, and in many other ways. You'll never know him as your Father.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.640]   There's only one way, it is in Christ. He alone gives me this knowledge. Did you
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:17.440]   ever notice the contrast between the Old Testament and the New, between Moses and
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.880]   Christ? Here it is. This is the highest point the Old Testament can rise unto.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:28.760]   "Like as a father pitieth his children." "Like as a father pitieth his children."
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:45.240]   But our Lord teaches us to say, "Oh God, what like a father?" No, our Father, our Father.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:56.080]   He gives us the spirit of adoption, the spirit of sonship, whereby we cry, "Abba,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:05.520]   Father." We no longer worship a God afar off. He is a God afar off. Dwelling in a
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.600]   light which is unapproachable, no man has seen him or can see him, the everlasting
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:19.880]   and eternal God. But in Christ I, even I, can venture unto him and say, "My Father,"
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:32.640]   and with others, "Our Father." "Abba, Father." The law was given by Moses, but
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:40.840]   the truth about God, the truth of God our Saviour, who adopts me into his family and
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:47.080]   makes me his child and enables me not to worship him in fear and terror, but to approach his
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:54.240]   throne with boldness and confidence and to say, "Abba, Father." This knowledge has
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:01.320]   come to me alone in and through the Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten God, who is in the
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:11.760]   bosom of the Father and who hath declared him unto us. Amen.
