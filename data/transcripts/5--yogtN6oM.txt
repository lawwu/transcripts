[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.440]   welcome to huberman lab essentials where we revisit past episodes for the most potent and
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.080]   actionable science-based tools for mental health physical health and performance
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.840]   i'm andrew huberman and i'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.560]   at stanford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.280]   stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring you zero cost to consumer
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.320]   information about science and science related tools to the general public we just closed out
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.720]   the episodes on hormones now we are going to talk about how to optimize physical performance and skill
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.040]   learning there are so many variables to physical performance and we can manage physical performance
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.560]   and skill learning from a variety of contexts i made just a short list of some of the things that come
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.520]   to mind that can powerfully impact physical performance and skill learning some of them
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.840]   are what i would consider foundational they allow you to show up with your current ability and if you
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   were to disrupt those you would perform less well so things like getting a good night's sleep things
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.480]   like being properly hydrated things like being well nourished there are supplements there are drugs there
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.040]   are different ways to breathe there are so many tools related to mindset visualization it's just a vast
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.520]   space but it's not infinite and there are a few things in the list of things that can impact and even
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.240]   optimize physical performance and skill learning that have an outsized effect that any of you can use
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.560]   so today we are going to focus on what i believe to be one of the most powerful tools to improve physical
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.880]   physical performance and skill learning and recovery we'll talk about about why that's important and
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   that's temperature believe it or not temperature is the most powerful variable for improving physical
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.920]   performance and for recovery there are two aspects to temperature of course there's heat and there's cold
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.840]   we are mainly going to focus on cold as a way to buffer heat we're going to talk about cold from the
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.160]   standpoint of thermal physiology this is a literature that's rich in scientific information that goes back
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.640]   very deep into the last century where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out that there are different
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   compartments in your body that heat and cool you differently and that you can leverage those in order
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.480]   to double even triple or quadruple your work output both strength repetitions and endurance so this is not weak
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.280]   sauce as they say this is the stuff that can really shift the needle quite a bit and it's not just about
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.120]   performing well once it's about being able to perform well and recover from that performance so that you
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.360]   do even better when you're not incorporating these tools on days where for instance you can't access
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   cold or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort let's start by talking about temperature
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.640]   how does temperature impact the body and its ability to perform including learn new skills so
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   everyone probably remembers or has at least heard of the word homeostasis right that the body wants to
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.560]   remain in a particular range of temperatures that it doesn't like to be too hot or too cold heating up
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   too much is just plain bad it's not just bad for physical performance it's bad for all tissue health
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.600]   cells stop functioning they stop being able to generate energy they stop being able to digest things you stop
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   being able to think and eventually those cells start dying off entirely now you don't want to become
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.520]   hypothermic either you can die from hypothermia just like you can die from hyperthermia however that you have
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:05.600]   a lot more range to be cold than you do to be too warm okay and in general the idea is to keep the body and brain in a
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.640]   a particular range but anytime we do anything our body temperature can shift so for instance
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.360]   if you were to stand next to a campfire where you were outside on a hot day various things would happen
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.680]   to dump heat from your body now what are those things well there are a huge category of them but the
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.520]   simplest way to think about this process is that when we get cold we tend to vasoconstrict we tend to our blood
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.000]   vessels tend to constrict and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body to preserve our core
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   organs okay so our periphery our hands and our feet and our toes and our legs become colder and our core
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   therefore can maintain blood to that area and we are insulating our core conversely when we heat up our
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.480]   blood vessels vasodilate they expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery and more blood can move
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.200]   throughout the body generally and we will perspire we will sweat water will actually get pulled out of
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   the blood to some extent moved up through sweat glands and will be brought to the skin surface so that
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.360]   it can be dumped we are dumping heat so it's very important that if you want to understand how you can
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.040]   leverage temperature for physical performance you have to understand that you have vasoconstriction to
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.240]   conserve heat vasodilation to dump heat that you have sweating to dump heat and you have conservation of
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.680]   fluids in order to preserve heat that's the most important thing in terms of understanding the
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.760]   mechanisms of maintaining and dumping heat and now the most important thing to understand is that if you
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.480]   get too hot your ability to contract your muscles stops okay i'm going to repeat this because it's
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.080]   vitally important atp is involved in the process of generating muscle contractions the range of
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.800]   temperatures within which atp can function and muscles can contract is very narrow somewhere around
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.520]   39 or 40 degrees celsius it drops off and you will not be able to generate more contractions
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.240]   now it's pretty hot but it can that temperature can be generated locally really fast put simply if you
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:30.400]   get too hot you stop exercising you may not even realize it but your will to exercise further your ability to push
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.680]   harder is entirely dependent on the heat of the muscle both locally and your whole system if you can keep
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:45.760]   temperature in range however in a proper range you will be able to do more work you will be able to create
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.000]   greater output you'll be able to lift more weight more sets more reps and you'll be able to run further
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   now there are data that i'm going to talk about in a little bit that are absolutely striking that
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.040]   underscore that statement there are data from my colleague craig heller's lab in the department of
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.160]   biology at stanford many if not all the nfl teams are now using this technology as well as military uses it
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   and not just for sports performance but also firefighters construction workers other professions where
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.960]   elevated heat becomes a barrier to performance and you can leverage this to really improve your
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:29.200]   workouts so how do you dump heat in order to perform longer safely well in order to understand that you
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.800]   have to understand that the body has three main compartments for regulating temperature okay we don't
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.600]   just have a center and a periphery we have three main compartments and there's one compartment in
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:47.360]   particular that all of you or most all of you i have to assume have and if you can understand how that
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.920]   works you can do tremendous things for your performance and for your recovery one is your core we already
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.320]   talked about that your core organs your heart your lungs your pancreas your liver the core of your body
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.320]   the other is the other is your periphery which are obviously your arms and your legs and your feet and
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:14.160]   your hands but then there's a third component which is there are three locations on your body that are far
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:22.960]   better at passing heat out of the body and bringing cool into the body such that you can heat up or cool your
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:32.640]   body everywhere very quickly those three areas are your face the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.800]   feet now the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet and to some extent on your face are called
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:49.680]   glabrous skin that's g-l-a-b-o-r-o-u-s glabrous skin and what's special about those areas of your body and the
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:58.320]   glabrous skin is that the arrangement of vasculature of blood vessels capillaries and arteries that serve
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.600]   those regions is very different than it is elsewhere in your body in these three regions of your hands
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:14.080]   your face and the bottoms of your feet we have what are called avas avas are a very special pattern of
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   vasculature avas are arteriovenous astomosis a-r-t-e-r-i-o arteriovenous v-e-n-o-u-s
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:38.400]   arteriovenous anastomosis a-n-a-s-t-o-m-o-s-e-s arteriovenous astomosis okay you want to know about
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.320]   arteriovenous astomosis trust me avas are direct connections between the small arteries and the
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.680]   small veins they bypass the capillaries to some extent they are little short vessel segments they
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.600]   have a big large inner diameter and they have this very thick muscular wall and they get input from what
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.680]   are called adrenergic neurons they get input from neurons that release norepinephrine and epinephrine
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.440]   which allows them to contract or dilate now there's some rules of physics that talk about
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.680]   how the radius of a pipe and small changes in the radius of a pipe leads to massive increases in the
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.400]   rate and amount of stuff that can flow through that pipe okay that's a rule of physics that says essentially
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.480]   that uh the radius is uh proportional to the amount of stuff that can flow through something to the
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.200]   fourth power what you need to know even if you don't want to know any of the underlying physics is that
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:45.360]   these avas allow more heat to leave the body more quickly and more cool to enter the body more quickly
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:54.880]   than other venous arterial capillary beds throughout the body in other words you can heat up best at the
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:01.680]   face the palms and the bottoms of the feet and you can cool down best at the face the palms and the
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.960]   bottoms of the feet than you can anywhere else on your body these three compartments of your body palms
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.720]   bottoms of the feet and face are your best leverage points for manipulating temperature to vastly improve
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.960]   physical performance so what craig and his colleagues did really illustrates perfectly what these body
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:31.680]   surfaces can do and why they were studying overheating in athletes and in military and in construction workers
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.240]   and trying to prevent it what they essentially found was that cooling the palms palmer cooling
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:47.520]   allowed people athletes and recreational athletes to run much further to lift more weight
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.560]   and to do more sets and reps to a absolutely staggering degree
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:04.080]   let's talk for a second a bit more about why we stop why we shut off effort when we get too hot when
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:12.880]   muscle heats up enzymes start getting disrupted and atp and muscles can't work so well and those muscles
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.080]   can't contract the enzyme that's involved here is something called pyruvate kinase and pyruvate kinase
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:27.600]   is essentially a rate limiting step it's a critical step that you can't bypass if you want muscles
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.000]   to contract and it's very temperature sensitive
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.320]   therefore if you can keep temperature lower you can do more work per unit time you can do more pull-ups
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.040]   what they essentially did is they brought someone into their laboratory
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.320]   who could do 10 pull-ups on the first set and they were able to get 10 rest two or three minutes get
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.920]   another 10 rest two or three minutes and if you've ever tried this what you find is that you start
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.960]   dropping to eight seven six etc now the person might not necessarily feel like they're overheating but
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:10.880]   the muscle is heating up then with their knowledge that these avas that these that these portals in the palms
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:18.960]   are a great way to both heat the body but also to dump heat from the body they used a device and i'll talk about
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.000]   what you can do at home but a device where they had people hold on to what was essentially
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   a cold tube now this is crucial the tube can't be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction because then
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   the cold won't pass from the tube to the hand and to the core but if it's the right temperature it's neither
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:49.520]   too hot nor too cold that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand these so-called palmer regions
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.960]   and then cools the core and in theory by lowering body temperature would allow the person or the athlete
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:04.560]   to do more work and indeed that's what they saw the actual data the specific data showed that subjects could
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.600]   do at least the subjects they worked with on their first day with no cooling about a hundred pull-ups
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:18.640]   the time frame that they had then they came back and did the cooling they did it the very next day
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.880]   which if you've ever trained a muscle the very next day typically you wouldn't do as well in its training
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.280]   if it took any damage from the previous sessions or you at least do as well but you probably wouldn't
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.400]   do what they then observed which was they started cooling after every other set the person would just
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.240]   hold the cold tube cool down the body after every other set rest everything else was kept the same
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:48.240]   and they found that they went to 180 pull-ups which is incredible it's a near doubling now you may be
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:56.720]   asking what about endurance with endurance similar increases have been shown and the way that they would
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.880]   do those tests are a little bit different and they also point to a really important mechanism of why we stop
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.200]   doing work at all when we perceive that we are putting in too much effort so it gets right to the heart of
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.600]   the relationship between temperature and muscles and your willpower those are directly related your
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.360]   body heat and your willpower are linked in a physiological way okay so let's talk about willpower
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   and heat and how heat shuts you down in other words if you are cool if your body temperature is in a
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.160]   particular range not only can you go further but you will go further if you want to
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.960]   said differently if you heat up too much you will stop or you will die
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   but there's a reflex that relates the body to the brain
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.280]   and the brain to the body that shuts off our effort when we get too hot
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.200]   so what craig and his colleagues and now others have done is to do a test in the laboratory where
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.920]   rather than ask people to run outside until they absolutely don't want to run anymore
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed okay so they have to keep up with the treadmill and at
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:18.000]   some point they quit and you take groups and you do those in different temperature environments so some
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.240]   people are running in a nice chilly laboratory they get their heart rate up so they get into a steady state
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.960]   cadence or rhythm and their heart is beating it more or less a steady state people will continue
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.840]   at that temperature and at that heart rate unless you start turning up the temperature in the room
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.400]   and at some point they will stop and they'll stop much earlier when it gets hot because of something
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.960]   called cardiac drift okay so let's say i'm running and i'm running at a steady cadence on this treadmill
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.520]   and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute or 100 beats per minute doesn't matter let's say 100 just for
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:00.720]   sake of example well just making the room hotter is going to increase my heart rate further even though
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   i'm at the same output and the brain does a computation it somehow figures out that there's a heat component
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.320]   that's increasing heart rate and there's an effort component from running that's driving heart rate
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.480]   and if the heat component and the and the heart rate output from the effort get to hit a certain threshold
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:29.360]   i stop increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting in part not entirely but in part because
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:36.640]   of this thing called cardiac drift heat increases heart rate effort increases heart rate at a steady
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.440]   effort you'll have a steady heart rate if you increase the heat in the environment that you're
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.240]   engaging in that steady heart rate your heart rate will now go up due to cardiac drift and you will quit
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.880]   okay so heller and colleagues have done experiments where they do palmer cooling under these environments
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:02.080]   and that's wonderful because not only does it enable people to go further and faster
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.920]   for much longer that's been shown statistically significant every time
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:15.200]   but it also protects the brain and body against hyperthermia overheating coma nerve injury nerve death
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:22.400]   and actual death okay so you can see why this is such a valuable tool so how can you start to incorporate
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:30.240]   this well first of all i always get asked how cold should the water be should it be ice water should it be
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:38.080]   very cold water the answer is no if you want to experience some of this effect without a device
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.360]   one thing you could do would be for instance to do i don't know i'll use the the the gym or the treadmill
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:49.200]   as an example you could do your maximum number of pull-ups stop and then you could actually put your
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:19:00.800]   hands into or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up with cool water so not ice water not
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   freezing cold but cool water slightly cooler than body temperature before you started training would be a
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.440]   good place to start you do that for 10 to 30 seconds then you could go back and do your next set you
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.760]   would repeat the cooling you would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhat so you might want to do
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.560]   that for 30 seconds to a minute this is not going to be perfect you're going to have to play with how
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:31.200]   cold to make it in order to get the optimal effect but you ought to see an effect nonetheless the same is
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.040]   true if you're running and you're fatiguing obviously you don't want to become hyperthermic cooling the
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.880]   hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face would be the ideal way to dump heat in order to be able to
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.360]   generate more output now the face is something that we haven't talked a lot about everything i've told
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.560]   you up until now also says that if you are somebody who tends to get cold when you are outside say in
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   the winter or even in the fall you tend to run cold warming your face is going to be the most important
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.480]   thing that you can do now you understand the principle and the locations at which to deliver heat and cold
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.640]   so let's say that you are out for a run and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism i talked to
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.520]   craig about this i said what would be the kind of uh uh poor person's approach to this one he said well
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:25.040]   you you could take a uh a frozen uh juice can if you have one of those or a very cold can of soda and
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.040]   you would want to pass it back and forth between your two hands the reason the passing back and forth is
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:37.920]   really important is because you again you don't want to be so cold that you constrict those venous portals
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.080]   that will allow cold to go into the body now there are certainly people that are working on
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:50.720]   bike handles and that can actually cool the hands here's what you don't want to do you don't want to
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:57.440]   cool the core if you want to cool the body right if it's a very hot day and you're going to train
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.680]   getting into an ice bath first sure it will it will cool you down but that's not going to be
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.600]   as effective as cooling the palms the bottoms of the feet and the face the one that i've tried
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.760]   because in anticipation of this episode was the dips where then i would cool my hands i actually
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.440]   decided to cool the bottoms of my feet as well because it just feels good and it's particularly hot out
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:25.840]   lately so no shoes or socks on put my feet into uh the bottoms of my feet just kind of hovering
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:31.360]   about a centimeter or two below the surface of a bucket of water that was just slightly it felt cool
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.960]   slightly cooler than um body temperature um or so it just basically what came out of the spigot after i
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:43.440]   let it run for a little bit and indeed i saw a 60 increase in the number of dips i can do in a single
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.040]   session so it's actually a quite significant effect and you don't have to be perfectly precise in order to do it
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.560]   so up until now we've been talking about how to use cold during a workout in order to improve
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.640]   performance now i want to talk about the use of temperature in particular cold to improve the speed
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:08.880]   and the depth of recovery recovery is obviously vital right during a weight training session or during
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.080]   an endurance session that's just the stimulus for getting better the next time and if you don't recover
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:21.040]   you not only won't get better but you'll get worse there's a lot of interest in the use of cold in
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.600]   order to improve recovery in the short term we see this and probably the best example of this would be
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   fighters in combat sports between rounds or athletes during uh in between quarters or half time
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.360]   that's one form of recovery the ability to go back into the sport very soon on an order of minutes
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.480]   anywhere from like one minute in between rounds in typical combat sports or several minutes at a
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.960]   half time etc and then of course there's recovery that occurs from session to session so outside of
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.800]   the game or the match or the or the exercise um session and many people are now relying on things
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.280]   like cryotherapy which requires a lot of expensive equipment big you know um liquid nitrogen driven uh
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.000]   machine that those aren't so common for most people are accessible for most people but a lot of people
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.400]   are using cold baths or ice baths or cold showers and again that's not going to optimize recovery in
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:24.720]   fact it's going to have an additional effect that is going to potentially block the training stimulus when
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.880]   you get into an ice bath you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation that occurs because of the training
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:37.600]   you get into the training session but in doing so you also are blocking pathways such as mTOR mammalian
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:44.400]   target a rapamycin which are involved in the adaptation for a muscle to become stronger or bigger put simply
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:52.480]   covering the body in cold or immersing the body in cold after training can short circuit or prevent the
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:58.240]   hypertrophy or muscle growth response it has other effects that can be positive right it can induce
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:05.280]   thermogenesis etc it can reduce inflammation but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exercise
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.120]   now it hasn't been examined so much for endurance work but let's say you come back from a round of
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:19.280]   endurance work a run or a bike or a swim getting into a cool bath or cooling the the palms the bombs of
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.520]   the feet of the face in my opinion based on the science would be better than completely immersing the body
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:33.360]   in the ice bath if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature for a and by resting temperature
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.600]   i mean within the range that you would see at any time of waking day but not in exercise if you can do
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:45.440]   that the sooner you can do that after a workout the sooner that the muscle will recover that the tendons
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.640]   will recover and that the person you can get back into more endurance training more weight training
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:58.160]   etc so cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery but to maximize return to baseline levels
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.680]   of temperature just simply cooling the entire body by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower is not the
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.360]   best way to go you really want to rely on one of these three glabrous skin portals of the palms the bottoms of
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.360]   the feet of the feet or the face one of the more commonly used compounds that's sold over the counter
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:21.440]   are non-steroid anti-inflammatories so things like tylenol and advil and other trade names and naproxen
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:29.520]   sodium things of that sort almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent and that's why
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.720]   it's often recommended that people take them when they have a fever now a number of athletes especially
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:40.800]   endurance athletes will rely on these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs specifically to keep body
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:48.080]   temperature lower during long bouts of exertion this is a little bit of a pharmacologic version of
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:56.240]   dumping heat instead of using palmer cooling or you know face face ice pack cooling they're relying on
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:02.800]   pharmacology to drop their core body temperature that has certain obvious advantages lower temperature allows
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:09.680]   you to go further harder with more intensity however they do have effects on the liver and they can
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.320]   also have effects on the kidneys and during long bouts of exercise or even short bouts of exercise
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   water balance and salt balance are also going to be vital to maintain in order to perform well
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.880]   generate the best muscle contraction stay mentally alert and also to stay alive you probably want to think
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.240]   carefully about whether or not you want to use non-steroid anti-inflammatories before any training
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.400]   session just for the performance augmentation effect unless you're working carefully with a coach
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:45.760]   i personally am more a fan of cooling of the palms cooling of the of the bottoms of my feet right by placing
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.400]   them into a bucket or uh into a cool bath after after training or cooling the face after training or
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.960]   sometimes even during training it just seems like there's more of a margin to play with the variables
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.280]   to heat up the water or cool it down a little bit um to include one palm or the other palm
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.120]   there's just all sorts of uh good parameter space as we call it in science that you can play with and work
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.880]   with to find what works for you as whereas when you pop a pill sure you can adjust the dose and you can
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.400]   adjust it next time but once it's in you it's in you and there's going to be some period of time before you can
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.880]   modulate it so it doesn't give you a lot of opportunity to play scientist which is what i like
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.840]   to do because what i'm always trying to do is trying to dial in the best protocols possible
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.000]   based on the mechanisms and data and if you can do that moment to moment that places you in a position
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.400]   of power once again we've covered a lot of material by now after seeing this episode or listening to this
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.880]   episode you should understand a lot about how your body heats and cools itself and the value of that for
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.000]   physical performance i hope you'll also appreciate that you have tools at your disposal
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.080]   to vastly improve your physical performance i've given you specific protocols and some direction
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.680]   but i've also left it slightly vague because as i mentioned earlier i don't know all the environmental
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.120]   conditions i don't know how hot your yoga studio is or how cool your gym happens to be or your body
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.880]   temperature or time of day remember your temperature will vary according to time of day going forward we're going to
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.720]   talk more about temperature and other ways to improve physical performance and skill learning we're going
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:28.480]   to talk about specific ways to accelerate fat loss to improve muscle growth to improve suppleness and
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:36.400]   flexibility these approaches and mechanisms are anchored deeply in neuroscience and physiology and the
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:43.280]   relationship between our peripheral organs which include our skin and our brain and all the organs in between
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.960]   and last but not least i want to thank you for your time and attention i realize this is a lot of information
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.120]   i hope you'll find some of it to be actionable and useful for you and for people that you know
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.240]   and as always thank you for your interest in science
