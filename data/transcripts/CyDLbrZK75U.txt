[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.120]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.440]   Today marks the second episode in the six-episode series
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.400]   with Dr. Andy Galpin, a professor of kinesiology
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.320]   at Cal State University, Fullerton,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.160]   and one of the foremost world's experts
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.360]   on the science and applications of methods
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.480]   to increase strength, hypertrophy, and endurance.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.240]   Today's episode is all about how to increase strength,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.780]   speed, and hypertrophy of muscles.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.400]   Professor Dr. Andy Galpin, great to be back.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.140]   Last episode, you told us about the nine
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.660]   specific adaptations that exercise can induce,
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.200]   everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.120]   muscular endurance, so on and so forth.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.240]   And you gave us this incredible toolkit
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.160]   of fit tests for each of those adaptations
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.440]   so that people can assess them for themselves
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.900]   and then, of course, improve on each and every one of them
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.160]   if they choose.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.440]   By the way, people can access that information
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   simply by going to the first episode in this series with you
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.160]   and it's all there and timestamped,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.840]   and I highly recommend people do that.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.580]   Today, we're talking about strength and hypertrophy.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.360]   And so right out the gate, I just want to ask you,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.000]   why should people think about and train
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.720]   for strength and hypertrophy?
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.440]   And that question is, of course, directed towards those
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.520]   that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760]   but I know that many people out there, perhaps,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.520]   have not thought about the benefits
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.440]   of strength and hypertrophy training
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.460]   and how beneficial it can be, not just for people
[00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.080]   that want to get bigger biceps, et cetera,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.220]   but that have other goals, longevity goals,
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.360]   and health goals unrelated to what most people
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.840]   associate with hypertrophy.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.860]   So what are the benefits of training
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.720]   for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.040]   for the athlete, for the recreational exerciser, and so on?
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.640]   - There's a wonderful saying.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840]   I think it was Bill Bowerman, one of the founders of Nike,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.400]   and he always said, "If you have a body, you're an athlete."
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760]   And I think that's very important for people to understand
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.840]   because one of the major disservices we've done in this field
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.340]   is convince people that things like strength training
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.500]   are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.480]   And cardiovascular training are for things
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.920]   like fat loss and heart health.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.080]   And that is a tremendous disservice
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.440]   and leads to a lot of false assumptions
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.800]   and therefore poor actions.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.440]   Classic examples of this are people who are resistant
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.240]   to strength training because they don't want to put on
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.800]   too much muscle.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.480]   People who only perform one type of exercise
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.040]   because they want, say, fat loss
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.120]   or they're in it for longevity and health,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.300]   and they're not worried about being an athlete.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.120]   And so right out the gates, we can actually draw back
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.580]   a little bit to what our previous conversation,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.040]   when I walked you through the history of exercise science.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.680]   And the reason I did that is to help you understand
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.820]   these are the railroads that you're running down
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.280]   and you don't even realize it
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.600]   in terms of everyone thinks of strength training
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.860]   and they immediately default to our principles
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.600]   to optimize muscle growth.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.240]   And that's not the only adaptation one should be after
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.360]   with strength training.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.620]   When we think of endurance training,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.900]   we immediately default to things like, again,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.100]   cardiovascular health or fat loss or things like that.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.440]   What I really want to do across this entire series
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.880]   and conversations is to just break that immediately.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.040]   Talk about all the other things
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680]   that you can do with your training
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   and so that people can be comfortable and confident
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.720]   in doing an optimal training program
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.840]   for whatever goal they have,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.560]   whether that be specific, like growing muscle,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.960]   or nonspecific, like just feeling better,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   having more energy, being more prepared
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.720]   for life and longevity.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.840]   And so to directly answer your question,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.400]   I could really, we could do 100 episodes
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.800]   on the benefits of exercise.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.840]   And we could run all the way from mood and focus,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.880]   cognitive tasks, to a better immune function.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.280]   You'll get less colds.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.120]   You'll fight them off more effectively.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.860]   To mortality, right?
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.280]   So some of the strongest predictors
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.780]   of how long and how well you will live are exercise.
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.760]   However, there are independent benefits
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.560]   that come from just endurance training
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.760]   and there are independent benefits
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.600]   that come from strength training.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.860]   And so to just give you one categorically,
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.400]   the way that you wanna think about this is
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.140]   resistance exercise and strength training
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.860]   is the number one tool to combat neuromuscular aging.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.020]   You cannot get that through any other form of exercise
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.960]   besides heavy overload strength training.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   And we can walk through in detail what that is,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.400]   but that is reason number one.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.440]   In general, human movement is a function of, number one,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   some sort of neuromuscular activation,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.480]   so nerves have to turn on.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.520]   The second part is muscles have to contract
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.480]   and the third part is those muscles have to move a bone.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   All right, if you want to be alive
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.840]   and you want to live by yourself,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.680]   you have to be able to engage in human movement.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.880]   If you have any dysfunction
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.540]   in the neuromuscular system there,
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.080]   then you're not gonna be able to do that.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.520]   And again, as I mentioned, the only way to preserve that
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.900]   or fight that loss of aging is to strength train.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.280]   So people will tend to hear numbers
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.880]   like you lose about 1% of muscle size
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.440]   per year after age about 40, and that's true.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.340]   However, what they don't realize is you lose
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.800]   about 2% to 4% of your strength per year.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.480]   So the loss of strength is almost double
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.700]   that the loss of muscle mass with aging.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.840]   Muscle power is more like 8% to 10% per year.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.280]   And so we can very clearly see the problem
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.480]   you're going to have with aging
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.820]   is not going to be preservation of muscle,
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.620]   although that is incredibly important.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.840]   It's going to be very specifically preservation
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.600]   of muscle power and strength.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   And why that really matters is your ability
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.220]   to, again, stand up and move,
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.040]   your ability to catch yourself from a fall,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.540]   your ability to feel confident doing a movement.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.280]   That is a function of muscle power
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.100]   more than it is muscle size.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.820]   And so functionality is really what we wanna be, right?
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.320]   You want to be able to do whatever you want to do physically
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.020]   and feel confident in doing that as you age.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.200]   That's going to only be obtained through strength training.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.120]   - So is it appropriate to say that training
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   for strength and hypertrophy is also a way
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.960]   to keep your nervous system healthy and young?
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.000]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.560]   It is the only exercise route we have for that.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.440]   If you look at just basic numbers like motor units,
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.200]   you're going to see that older individuals
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.080]   have like a 30 to 40% reduction in total motor units.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.580]   - So when you say older,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.760]   approximately what ages are you referring to?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.400]   'Cause I know many people out there, such as myself,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.000]   are 40 and older,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.160]   but I know many of our listeners are in their 20s,
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.440]   maybe even in their teens.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.760]   And I can imagine that people that start doing
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.880]   strength and hypertrophy training younger
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   will afford themselves an advantage over time,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.200]   but that everybody should be doing
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.060]   strength and hypertrophy training
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.840]   for as much of their lifespan as possible.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.240]   That's really the message that I'm getting.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.500]   So if somebody is, for instance, 45,
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.040]   would that fall into the bin of older?
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.160]   - You're gonna start seeing decrements past,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.800]   again, around the age of 40 or so.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.920]   Now there's a lot of genetic variation there,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.800]   and a lot of other things go into that equation,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.720]   like your sleep and your nutrition.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.840]   But that's a fair number to sort of think about.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.640]   One actually, response is,
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.120]   it's actually sort of counterintuitive.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.400]   The wonderful thing about strength training
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.880]   is you don't actually have to start at a young age.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   You can actually, in fact,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.000]   I was reading a paper this morning
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.360]   because of our previous conversation,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.400]   it was in over age 90.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.160]   So these are folks 90 plus,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.840]   and they saw improvements like 30 to 170%
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.920]   in things like muscle size and hypertrophy
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.280]   over a very short period of time.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.080]   I think it was 12 weeks.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.360]   So you don't actually have to start.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.660]   There are some adaptations
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.640]   that you're gonna need for health
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   that you, God, you really need to start in your 20s.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.000]   The reason I like to mention that is
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.920]   because if you are listening and you are 50,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.860]   and you're like, oh, shit,
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.820]   I haven't been strength training,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.200]   you're not toast.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   Like you should absolutely start now,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.680]   but you're gonna be able to get to a fantastic spot
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.400]   very quickly.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.320]   Similarly, though,
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.400]   if you are 20 or 25 and 30 and you aren't lifting,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.860]   there are still many reasons why you should do that now.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.520]   And I'd like to point that out
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.120]   because a lot of folks would be like, oh, my gosh,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.380]   they said I have to do it when I'm 20 or 25,
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.360]   or I'll be sort of screwed.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   And that's not the case at all.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.400]   There's really no age limit on this.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.660]   In fact, there's actually interesting data
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.120]   that just came out
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.600]   showing this reduction in muscle strength.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.320]   And hypertrophy that I sort of talked about
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.960]   is basically ameliorated with a preservation of activity.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.800]   In other words,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.400]   you don't lose these functionalities because of aging.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.740]   You lose these because of a loss of training.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.920]   To state that again,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.480]   you don't lose these because of some innate
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.160]   physiological thing that happens
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.680]   with genes become less sensitive or you lose functionality.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.840]   You pretty much can describe the loss of function
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.920]   of strength and muscle in aging
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   as exclusively because of a loss of training
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.880]   and nutrition and anabolic resistance
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.720]   and some other things.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.240]   So you can do a lot more than you think
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.800]   when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.640]   And that's really important to point out.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   - I'm reminded of the words of the great Sherrington.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.120]   He won the Nobel Prize as a physiologist.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.960]   I guess the neuroscientist try and claim him
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   as a neuroscientist because he worked on the nervous system.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.080]   The physiologist claim as a physiologist.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.880]   - He is 100% a physiologist.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.420]   - I would call him a neuroscientist.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.000]   Maybe we can argue about this later.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   - We will.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   - I think one of the key things that Sherrington pointed out
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.120]   was that, and I believe the quote was that,
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.440]   "Movement is the final common path."
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.120]   And what he was referring to was the fact that
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.700]   a significant fraction of the brain itself
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.240]   is devoted to our ability to move
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.520]   and our ability to engage in resistance type movements.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.200]   And that resistance type movements
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.720]   and the continuation of movement throughout the lifespan
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.800]   is what keeps the brain young and healthy and vital.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.640]   And there are so much data now to support that.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.560]   But I'm so grateful that you brought up early this fact
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.120]   that there's a neuromuscular link.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.180]   'Cause I think a lot of people think about musculoskeletal.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.640]   They forget that the nervous system is really in charge
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.700]   of the strength of the muscle contractions
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.900]   and the types of muscle contractions that occur.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.560]   I'm certain we're gonna get into that
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.400]   in a lot of depth today.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.440]   - You're close there.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.880]   We're not totally right, but we're close.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.680]   Okay, well, I look forward to being corrected
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.520]   and to achieving the precision that you're known for
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   around that discussion.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.840]   So if we are to step back and say strength training
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.280]   and hypertrophy training is critical
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.400]   for people of all ages,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.080]   for developing and maintaining the neuromuscular system
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.260]   and for our ability to function in the world,
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.240]   not just offset injury,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.080]   but the ability to pick things up and move, et cetera.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.300]   What are some of the other things
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.520]   that strength and hypertrophy training can provide?
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.200]   I know a lot of people use strength and hypertrophy training
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.300]   for changing their aesthetics.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.120]   What is your sense about its potency for changing aesthetics
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.700]   as compared to say cardiovascular exercise?
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.280]   - Yeah, the mantra I always like is,
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.520]   the reason you wanna exercise is threefold, right?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.320]   You wanna look good, feel good, play good.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.820]   That's really, that comes from sport,
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.520]   comes from football, specifically we always say that.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.540]   And what that means really is you wanna look good.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.160]   People want to look the way they want to look,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.120]   whatever that means to them.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.880]   And there are any versions of what you feel
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.120]   to be aesthetically pleasing, and that's totally irrelevant.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.640]   But people want to look the way they wanna look.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.280]   Number two, you wanna be able to feel good.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.100]   What's that mean?
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.940]   You wanna be injury-free,
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.240]   you wanna have energy throughout the day,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.560]   you wanna be able to execute anything you want to.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.160]   So whether you wanna go surf in the morning,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.840]   you wanna play racquetball, you wanna hike,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.960]   or you wanna do all three of those in one day,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.840]   you should have the ability to do that.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   And then you wanna play good,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   which means you should be able to execute
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.820]   any, again, activities that you wanna execute,
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.660]   whatever that means.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.060]   All right, so backing all up,
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.860]   what's that gotta do with your question?
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.020]   One of the major benefits of strength training
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.100]   is the responses tend to happen extremely fast.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.460]   So you can see noticeable changes in muscle size,
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.660]   certainly within a month, absolutely within six weeks.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.380]   And so we have this wonderful feedback loop
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.780]   that sort of tells you, am I doing this incorrectly?
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:17.880]   Oh my gosh, yes I am.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.180]   Also, it's very addicting, the feedback, the response,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.460]   the physical changes, whether this is actually 0.2 or three,
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.180]   look good, or feel good, play good,
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.740]   or it's even just part one, you're starting to see that.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.380]   When you compare that to things like fat loss,
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.000]   that journey tends to be longer.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.860]   It's more difficult, it's more relying upon other factors
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.880]   like nutrition, et cetera.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.320]   Strength training is really about like,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.360]   there's some very minimal nutrition requirements.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.980]   Outside of that, it comes down to the training
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.640]   and the feedback is immediate.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.480]   That's powerful because if you look across the literature
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.820]   on exercise adherence, you'll see that that is in fact
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.340]   the number one predictor of effectiveness
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.540]   of any training program.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.520]   So what that means is if you were to put any variable
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.800]   possible and figure out what is going to determine
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.120]   whether or not this program works.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.600]   This is what we typically call the methods are many
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.740]   and the concepts are few.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.120]   So the methods of exercise,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.640]   the methods of strength training,
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.480]   the methods of hypertrophy training,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.020]   which we'll talk about, are infinite.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.900]   However, there are only a handful of key concepts
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.380]   that you have to achieve in order for that program to work.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.260]   Adherence is one of them and again, is often the top one.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.420]   So you need to do something,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.700]   you need to do something consistently.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.900]   When you are getting that feedback
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.060]   and you're seeing results in your appearance immediately
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.180]   and you see that every single day,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.580]   every time you take off your shirt
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.740]   or every time you look in the mirror, you see that result,
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.540]   that tends to drive adherence really powerfully.
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.620]   So it's important to give people wins,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.900]   especially people who are not maybe like you and I,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.940]   who are like, I'm gonna lift weights
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.980]   and I'm gonna exercise like no matter what
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.380]   the rest of my life, because I just love it.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.740]   Not everyone's like that.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.740]   And so giving them a little bit of care of success
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.580]   and if you can achieve that in, you know,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.020]   say three to four to five weeks already,
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.320]   it's very powerful tool.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.700]   - Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.260]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.240]   It is also separate from Dr. Galpin's teaching
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.580]   and research roles at Cal State Fullerton.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.460]   It is however, part of our desire and effort
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.980]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.480]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.620]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.480]   we'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.500]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.820]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.080]   The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to be partnering
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.380]   with Momentus for several important reasons.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.540]   First of all, as I mentioned,
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.460]   their supplements are of extremely high quality.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.220]   Second of all, their supplements are generally
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.260]   in single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.700]   If you're going to develop a supplementation protocol,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.140]   you're going to want to focus mainly
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.260]   on using single ingredient formulations.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.020]   With single ingredient formulations,
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.340]   you can devise the most logical and effective
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.780]   and cost effective supplementation regimen for your goals.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.100]   In addition, Momentus supplements ship internationally.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.080]   And this is of course important because we realized
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.100]   that many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.060]   reside outside the United States.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.980]   If you'd like to try the various supplements mentioned
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.460]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.860]   in particular supplements for hormone health,
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.980]   for sleep optimization, for focus,
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.160]   as well as a number of other things,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.820]   including exercise recovery,
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.940]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.620]   so that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.500]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.140]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.780]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.640]   I've been using an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.200]   for about the last eight months,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.540]   and it has completely transformed my sleep.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.320]   I'm sleeping about the same amount,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   but I'm sleeping far deeper,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.700]   and I'm now getting the proper ratios
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.020]   of so-called rapid eye movement,
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.660]   or REM sleep and slow wave sleep,
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.780]   and waking up feeling far more recovered
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.240]   mentally and physically.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   The underlying mechanism for all that
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.380]   is very straightforward.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.020]   I've talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.300]   about the critical relationship
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.560]   between sleep and body temperature.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.480]   That is, in order to fall asleep at night,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.900]   your body needs to drop by about one to three degrees
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.340]   in terms of core body temperature,
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.420]   and waking up involves a one to three degree increase
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.740]   in core body temperature.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.340]   With Eight Sleep mattress covers,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.900]   you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.380]   to be one temperature at the start of the night,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.160]   a different temperature the middle of the night,
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.300]   and a different temperature as you approach morning,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.780]   each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.620]   and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.820]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,

[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.540]   Levels is a program that lets you see
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.140]   how different foods and activities affect your health
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.820]   by giving you real-time feedback on your blood glucose
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.900]   using a continuous glucose monitor.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.040]   Many people are aware that their blood sugar,
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.760]   that is their blood glucose level,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.120]   is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.500]   to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.980]   Most people do not know, however,
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.420]   how different foods and different activities,
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.860]   including exercise or different temperature environments,
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.400]   impact their blood glucose levels,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   and yet blood glucose is exquisitely sensitive
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.360]   to all of those things.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.220]   I first started using Levels about a year ago
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.120]   as a way to understand how different foods,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.080]   exercise, and timing of food relative to exercise
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.660]   and quality of sleep at night
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.340]   impact my blood glucose levels,
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.700]   and I've learned a tremendous amount from using Levels.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.820]   It's taught me when best to eat, what best to eat,
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.720]   when best to exercise, how best to exercise,
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.420]   and how to modulate my entire schedule
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:39.380]   from work to exercise and even my sleep.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.140]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.760]   and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.980]   go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.480]   That's levels.link/huberman.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.140]   Let's talk about strength and hypertrophy.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.400]   If you would, please remind us
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.120]   what strength and hypertrophy are
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.660]   in terms of the specific adaptation they represent.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.740]   What I mean by that is
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.960]   when somebody is training for strength,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.940]   what are they really training for?
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.940]   Obviously, it means the ability to move more weight,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.740]   but I know that it includes
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.180]   a number of other things as well.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.720]   And when one is training for hypertrophy
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.980]   for the growth of muscle fibers,
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.540]   what does that represent?
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.440]   Because I think if people understand that,
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.080]   they will far better understand the methods and protocols
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.560]   that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.500]   - At its core, you've basically described it.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.520]   When we talk about strength,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.700]   we're talking about an actual function.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.580]   So can you create more force across a muscle or muscle groups
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.320]   or total movement?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.700]   And when we talk about hypertrophy,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.880]   now we're specifically referring
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.980]   to just an increase in size.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.180]   There's no actual mention of function.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.300]   So a muscle can grow larger
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.720]   without actually technically being stronger
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.420]   for a number of reasons.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.020]   However, there is a strong relationship
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.260]   between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.420]   So a lot of the times in the general public
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.280]   in the lay conversations,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.020]   we sort of lump those two things in as the same thing.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.140]   And so we have to recognize people who are new to training
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.940]   or people even are intermediately trained.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.620]   There is a huge overlap between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.500]   Once you get past that though,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.900]   they become disentangled.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.160]   And a good example of it is this.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.400]   If you look at the strongest people in the world,
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.540]   this would be people who compete
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.740]   in the sport of powerlifting, right?
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.420]   That's a true test of maximal strength.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.800]   So it is a deadlift, a bench press and a back squat.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.540]   And you're going to do a one repetition max
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.380]   in all three of those.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.740]   So whoever wins is the person
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.440]   who lifted the most amount of weight one time.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.280]   That's it.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.820]   It's not like world's strongest man where it is,
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.940]   how many reps can you do in a row or your time, right?
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.480]   Is a true maximal strength test.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.300]   And you compare those to say bodybuilders.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.580]   Now, both of those individuals are strong
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.100]   and both of those individuals have a lot of muscle.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.980]   However, it is extremely clear
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.540]   the powerlifters will be significantly stronger
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.900]   than the bodybuilders on average, right?
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.420]   There are individual exceptions,
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.780]   but we're just talking collective averages.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.540]   And the bodybuilders will have more muscle
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.720]   than the other ones.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.600]   In addition, whether you look at Olympic weightlifting
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.380]   or powerlifting or world's strongest man for that matter,
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.900]   there are weight classes.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.520]   And the reason is as you go up in weight classes,
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.300]   you will always see the world records go higher
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.420]   and higher and higher, right?
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.420]   So you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.220]   However, there's a point, right?
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.660]   Where you simply have to add more mass to get a higher number
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.220]   and that's why we have weight classes in those sports
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.940]   and in combat sports and lots of other things.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.720]   So there's a lot of confusion, right?
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.220]   Because people think, man, either these are the same thing
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.540]   or if I wanna get stronger, I have to get bigger,
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.180]   which is not the case at all.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.020]   Another misnomer here is I can't get stronger
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.140]   unless I add muscle.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.260]   That's not true either, right?
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.400]   It's a similar idea.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.180]   So what I'm saying is you have the ability
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.280]   to do whatever you'd like.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.340]   If you'd like to get stronger and add muscle, great.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.060]   If you add muscle, you're probably going to bring
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.420]   some strength along for the ride.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.060]   However, if you wanna get stronger
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.740]   and you don't wanna add muscle for any reason,
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.280]   personal preference on aesthetics,
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.300]   whether you're in a weight class
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.780]   and you simply can't afford it,
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.260]   it is quite easy to get stronger
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.580]   and not add much muscle mass either.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.300]   And so differentiating these two things
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.020]   is one of them is simply a measure of size
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.660]   and the other one is a measure of force.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.060]   And when we talk about strength,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.920]   what we're really talking about are two unique components.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.200]   Component one is what I call the physiology.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.920]   So what is the ability of the neuromuscular system?
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.640]   What is the ability of the muscle fibers
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.720]   to contract and produce force?
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.640]   The other one is what we call mechanics.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.820]   And mechanics is simply things like it's minutia
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.340]   down to how long your femurs are relative to your tibia
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.660]   or other things like this is biomechanics.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.440]   This is also technique.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   This is skill.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.020]   This is how smooth you feel.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.420]   This is, are you firing the right muscle group
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.120]   in the right sequence and order?
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.020]   And all of these things play into strength.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.060]   So somebody who maybe has more force capability
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.620]   in their muscle fibers,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.780]   but their technique and the movement is worse,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.500]   may lose in a competition.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.180]   Or somebody again, who's like,
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.680]   if you go into the world of speed and power,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.140]   especially you'll hear a lot of people talk
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.460]   about like the rhythm.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.220]   And there's just a certain rhythm that has to happen
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.860]   if you want to jump as high as possible
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.580]   or run as fast as possible.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.100]   But that's all mechanics at this fundamental level.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.200]   So when we look at hypertrophy,
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.620]   it's just still simply about how big the muscle is.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.700]   So those are the really the similarities and distinctions
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.780]   between strength and hypertrophy.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.780]   - When strength improves and when hypertrophy increases,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.540]   is there also involvement in the ligaments and tendons?
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.540]   That is, of course, the ligaments and tendons
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.820]   are involved in the movements.
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.420]   But do ligaments and tendons themselves grow
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.580]   and or get stronger?
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.320]   - This field is really difficult
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:11.060]   because connective tissue is not vascular.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.940]   And so their plasticity is significantly lower
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.860]   than skeletal muscle.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.940]   In fact, if you look across all the organs,
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.460]   a skeletal muscle is one of, if not the most plastic.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.620]   Meaning it's the most pliable, the most responsive,
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.660]   the one that's going to adjust.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.660]   It's basically, it's paying attention to everything
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.860]   that's being said in the body.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.540]   You cannot change blood pressure or pH
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.560]   or macronutrients floating around
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.000]   without muscle knowing about it.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.180]   It is, in fact, this is why we call muscle an organ.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.340]   People don't tend to think about this
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.380]   if you were ever on like Jeopardy.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.440]   And they ask you that question of like,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.260]   what's the biggest organ system in the body?
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.780]   People tend to say--
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.960]   - The skin.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.540]   - Muscle is actually the correct answer.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.860]   - All right, well, I'm going to cite you when I get it wrong.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.060]   - You'll probably get it wrong on Jeopardy.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.800]   - I don't have any immediate plans to go on Jeopardy,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.640]   but who knows?
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.460]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.940]   Celebrity Jeopardy, Henry Huberman.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.600]   - Wait, I don't know about the celebrity part,
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.260]   but Jeopardy would be fun.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.460]   But I will say the muscle and I'll,
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.020]   if you get a phone call on Jeopardy, I don't know,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.640]   I haven't seen that show in a very long time, maybe ever,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.860]   then I'll call you.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.820]   But that makes sense.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.220]   The muscles would be the largest organ system in the body.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.140]   - The reason I was saying that is,
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.660]   so muscle is both listening and talking.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.580]   It is controlling the immune system a lot.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.740]   It's controlling blood glucose regulation.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.960]   It is the central depot for amino acids,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.820]   which are needed to do things
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.380]   like regulate the immune system,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.600]   build any new red blood cells.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.980]   A lot of this stuff is coming from skeletal muscle.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   So when we say organ, by the way,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.140]   that's actually like a physiological definition.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.120]   So something that's communicating
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.920]   to either another organ itself or throughout the system.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.380]   So it's listening and it's talking.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.200]   Connected tissue is not the same way.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.100]   And so we do see adaptations
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.800]   with strength training in connective tissue.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.780]   It's just much lower.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.780]   It's difficult to measure.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.780]   Effectively, what we know now is
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.420]   you're gonna have a combination of adaptations
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.320]   throughout the connective tissue.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.660]   It is beneficial.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.100]   This is probably one of the major reasons
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.720]   that strength training reduces injury risk,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.860]   which is very, very important
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.220]   because people who tend to wanna pick up an exercise routine
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.900]   after say 10 years,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.320]   the classic cliche is like,
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.380]   I played all these things in high school.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.740]   Then I went to college, got a job.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.480]   Now I'm 25 or 35 or whatever.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.820]   You sort of wanna jump back into what you did
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.660]   when you were 20.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.460]   Well, there's no tissue tolerance left.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.700]   And what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.740]   The tolerance in there is not ready
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.260]   for the load you're about to handle.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.580]   And so you go through some movement and then boom,
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:41.060]   sprains, tears, even like the more significant ones
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.780]   are on Achilles tear, which is gonna really sideline you.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:44.780]   So those are some of the problems.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.740]   And we know strength training has a large role
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.920]   in injury reduction for stress and strain
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.760]   and overuse injuries.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.800]   And that's specifically coming
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.480]   for the connective tissue adaptations.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.380]   Again, the difficult part here is it's very hard to assess.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.220]   We actually, when I was a doctoral student,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.440]   we played around with patella tendon biopsies.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.700]   So I actually had one.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.540]   This is like a-
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.740]   - There's a little piece of your patella tendon missing?
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.580]   - Yeah.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.860]   - Because your own lab looks weird.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.080]   - So now I've probably had,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.700]   I don't know how many hundreds of biopsies
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.500]   I've performed on people, probably well over a thousand,
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.820]   certainly well over a thousand.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:21.620]   I've probably had 35 or 40 done on myself.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.580]   There's no problem here.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.480]   I have no scar tissue.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.780]   I have no loss of function and I've stuck needles
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:27.580]   in every leg, like all over myself, right?
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.700]   Quads, my soleus, gastroc, like all up and down.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.700]   - Taking tissue out.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.260]   - Yeah, you want the needle, looks like a pen basically.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.500]   And you're live and you go in and grab a chunk
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.900]   and you pull it out and-
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.300]   - Can I come to your lab and get biopsies?
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:41.960]   - Yeah, you're probably, if you're looking
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.520]   under the microscope, it'll just look like
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.820]   the molecule caffeine.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.300]   - There's a mutual friend of ours
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.000]   who came down and did that.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.660]   He's a big, big, big gentleman,
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.060]   big into lifting, very into strength training.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.560]   And he went through that experience and he was like,
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.600]   "Oh my gosh."
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.460]   It was not what he was hoping to get.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.840]   He actually had unbelievable muscle morphology.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.660]   His fibers were, the diameter of muscle fibers
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.780]   is extremely large.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.340]   It's one of the biggest cells by volume in all of biology,
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.040]   skeletal muscle in human.
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.160]   - How large?
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.700]   Can't help myself.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.180]   Millimeters?
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.760]   - Well, so you have length and then you have width, right?
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.840]   So lengthwise, it can be extraordinarily long.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.100]   You can be, the classic example is like your sartorius,
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.240]   which is like the front of your hip
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.900]   to the inside of your kneecap.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.420]   Theoretically, those cells can run the entire length,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.900]   which would be one muscle fiber running that thing.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.740]   If I were to do a biopsy on you
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.120]   and I pulled that tissue out,
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.460]   I could actually pull an individual fiber out with tweezers
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.260]   and hold it up and you could see that whole muscle cell.
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.740]   - Yeah, I'm definitely not allowed to get biopsied.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.220]   - You'd be stunned how big they are.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.220]   Anyways, his was the size of a rhino.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.220]   So the diameter of his,
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.380]   now he has a well-documented assistance
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.400]   in the area of muscle growth, we'll say.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.100]   But yeah, those can be large.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.180]   So what were we even talking about there?
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.780]   - Well, I was asking about tendons and ligaments
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.580]   because I'd like to understand the various tissues
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.900]   and organ systems that adapt when one gets stronger,
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.900]   when muscle tissue grows.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.740]   And I do want to ask about bone.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.180]   And here I'm not referring to bone mineral density.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.980]   What I was going to ask is whether or not bone itself
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.140]   can grow and get stronger.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.980]   And the reason I'm asking
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.620]   is there's a favorite result of mine.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.520]   I have about 3,800 favorite results.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.680]   3,000 pet peeves and 3,800 plus favorite results.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.220]   But one of my favorite results
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.780]   is from Eric Kandel's lab at Columbia.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.660]   Eric won the Nobel Prize for learning and memory
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.020]   and his laboratory got really into the effects of exercise
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.300]   on learning and memory.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.300]   And they had this incredible result, which is that
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.860]   load-bearing exercise stimulates the bones
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.060]   to release something called osteocalcin, excuse me.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.020]   And then osteocalcin acts as a,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.860]   more or less a hormone, travels to the brain
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.620]   and enhances the memory systems in the brain
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.200]   by enhancing neuron health.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   That's the basic crux of the studies.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.500]   There were several of these.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.540]   And the moment I saw the first of those studies,
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.600]   I thought, well, here's another reason
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.240]   to do resistance type exercise and not just aerobic exercise.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.320]   And then it brings to mind
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.400]   whether or not bones themselves get stronger
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.980]   when we do resistance training.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.200]   I don't know the answer to that.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.720]   - Yeah, that's very clearly demonstrated.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.280]   And we've known that for many decades.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   You have a diminishing ability to do so with age,
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.840]   particularly you need to do this in your teens and twenties.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.260]   That's where you're going to have the largest ability
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.280]   to enhance bone mineral density.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.080]   And it's particularly responsive to axial loading.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.440]   Now I'm a muscle guy, I'm not a bone specialist,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   so we would have to consult somebody
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.680]   who can give you more position here.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.520]   But that's the problem. - Can you explain
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.040]   axial loading? - It's up and down.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.000]   It's vertical.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.160]   - Okay, so it's almost like a cylinder
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.280]   putting weight on the small end of the cylinder,
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.880]   on both small end of the cylinders.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.680]   If someone doesn't do this in their twenties or teens,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.280]   however, can we assume that some degree of positive change
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.800]   will occur if they do resistance training,
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.000]   even if it's a small fraction?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.720]   - The answer is yes, it is small.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.400]   We have worked with a number of women
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.720]   in our rapid health program that come in
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.040]   and they are in their twenties and they're in their thirties
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.480]   and they have significant bone mineral density problems.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.920]   And eight months later, we can see noticeable changes
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.720]   that are outside of the measurement error of a DEXA.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.560]   - Positive changes. - Positive changes, correct.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.000]   And if you worked with, there are many physicians
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.480]   that specialize in this area.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.260]   You're going to need a nutrition here.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.160]   Strength training alone is probably not going to get you
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.280]   there, particularly with women,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.040]   because you have to figure out why.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.300]   And there's a lot going on with the physiology
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.400]   and biochemistry.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.920]   So you probably like almost surely needed to have
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.200]   some blood chemistry done with that.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.400]   You have to figure out what's going on menstrual cycle wise.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.940]   In fact, like oftentimes what we'll do for our women
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.520]   very specifically is we use a thing called
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.040]   the rhythm plus a 30 day test.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.440]   So you can actually do a salivary test
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.400]   across the entire menstrual cycle.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.080]   And you can take samples, it's about every other day.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.180]   So you'll get 15 or 16 samples
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.780]   and you get a really beautiful picture
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.000]   of what's happening hormonally
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.780]   across the entire menstrual cycle.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.860]   And that's really, really important
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.540]   because typically for women,
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.980]   if you get a single sample or simple time point,
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.920]   whether it's salivary, urine or blood,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.660]   you can have, well, like order of magnitude difference
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.460]   in any number of metrics because of what phase you're in.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.500]   This is one of the many reasons why it's been
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.960]   such a challenge to do a lot of physiology research
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.440]   with females.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.220]   Some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle,
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.060]   others don't.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.940]   Like strength is a very good example.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.000]   I can strengthen and I can do a one rep max test
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.880]   on a woman at any point.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.640]   I don't have to do that at a certain phase
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.160]   of their menstrual cycle because it's,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.340]   the evidence I think is pretty clear at this point,
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.640]   that number won't change.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.080]   So I have no qualms including females in any of my studies
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.900]   where strength is an absolute,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.500]   is an important dependent variable
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.780]   because I don't have to adjust around menstrual cycle.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.820]   Other factors like anything in blood,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.960]   anything hormone related,
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.680]   you're gonna have to automatically account for it.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.600]   So what I would say is those folks should absolutely work
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.800]   with a qualified physician and you're gonna have
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.200]   to get some nutrition supplementation potentially
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.000]   and then maybe even some other stuff going on.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.740]   To make that even more complicated,
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.800]   if you're on any form of birth control or not,
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.760]   that's going to change the entire equation,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.640]   especially if it's a hormone based birth control.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.640]   So it just gets really, really complicated.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.880]   To answer it though, you can see adaptations.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.620]   They are significantly diminished relative
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.240]   to if you were started in your teens and 20s,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.380]   but there is hope.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.060]   You just need to work with somebody who specializes
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.680]   in that area.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.760]   - So for both men and women, boys and girls,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.520]   what are the major adaptations that occur
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.160]   to underlie improvements in strength?
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.880]   And if you would, if you could just provide
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.980]   a bullet point list of that and then we can dive
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.580]   into each of those in detail.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.340]   For instance, are nerves getting more efficient at firing?
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.620]   Are bones enjoying adaptations in different bone connective
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.520]   tissue relationships that underlie strength?
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.060]   I have to imagine all of these things are happening,
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.560]   but what are the major changes that are occurring
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.840]   in those organs and organ systems that reflect
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.280]   someone's ability to on one day lift 100 pounds
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.860]   and then a week later to lift 105 pounds?
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.820]   - Now, I'll try to keep this condensed.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.520]   Again, this could be an entire university course.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.300]   I will also try to give you a little bit of bones here.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.500]   So normally as a muscle guy, I only,
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.400]   I take all the credit in muscle.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.600]   Turns out the nervous system gets a little bit
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.680]   of credit too here.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.240]   - Thank you.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   - So as we walk through it, just in, as a big picture,
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.560]   if we think about again, what causes human movement,
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.360]   basically everything along that chain
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.140]   will improve the strength training.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.480]   And I'm not really being, using too much hyperbole there.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.300]   It's quite impressive.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.320]   So it's going from the nervous system side of the equation.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.520]   What has to happen for human movement is a nerve
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.360]   has to send a signal through a motor unit.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.600]   Now motor unit is, comes down and innervates
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.920]   multiple muscle fibers.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.760]   So if you think about your actual muscle, it's not a thing.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.520]   It is a component of many individual muscle fibers.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.360]   So you've got millions, if not more.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.840]   Think of it like a ponytail.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.000]   So we collectively say ponytail and you think of it
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.800]   as like one thing, but really a ponytail is a combination
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   of tons of individual hairs, okay?
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.000]   Muscle is the same way.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.600]   So this motor unit comes in and innervates a lot
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.980]   of different muscle fibers.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.100]   Now, every one of the fibers in a motor unit
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.360]   is generally of the same fiber type.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.020]   So fast twitch or slow twitch.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.300]   And they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle.
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.580]   They are spread out across horizontally, vertically,
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.760]   as well as closer to the bone and further to the surface.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   So they're moved throughout the entire way.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   And this is what allows you to have smoother contractions
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.780]   and you don't have specificity and things like that.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.300]   So we see improvements from the neuromuscular side,
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.640]   like firing rate.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.460]   We see synchronization improvements that are coming in.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.480]   You also see improvements in things like acetylcholine
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.040]   release from the presynaptic neuron.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.980]   So you're getting it faster.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.620]   We see calcium recycling is improved back to there.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.460]   So in order for, without walking into too much
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.200]   of the biochemistry, in order for a signal to go
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.400]   from nerve to muscle, there's a little bit of a gap.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.040]   There's a physical space that happens.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.820]   And what happens is you release this molecule
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:19.960]   called acetylcholine.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.680]   This goes into the postsynaptic cleft,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.120]   and then that actually binds to a receptor.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.180]   That receptor actually opens up a door that lets sodium in.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.080]   That's really what's happening.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.200]   So it's not the acetylcholine.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.820]   Without acetylcholine then sits on that receptor site,
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.160]   it's broken down, put back in and recycled back up
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.580]   in the presynaptic nerve site.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.280]   The faster you can do that,
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.320]   the faster you can recycle that signal.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.960]   And so almost everything that I described
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.800]   in that entire system improves and has been shown
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.860]   to increase with training.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.740]   So that alone is given to give you benefits.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.260]   We haven't even walked into getting
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.960]   from an electrical signal now into an action potential,
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.560]   which is gonna cause a muscle contraction.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.360]   So getting from nerve into the muscle,
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.440]   we see everything from improvements
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.020]   that we call contractility,
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.760]   which means the muscle fiber themselves
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.120]   can produce more force or more velocity independent
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.000]   of muscle size changes.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.140]   This is another component.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.880]   When we asked like, well, how is it I got stronger
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.620]   without getting bigger?
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.940]   Well, in the muscle fiber itself,
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.500]   its ability to contract force increases.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.700]   And this is because we have everything
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.180]   like the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.700]   which is the place that stores and releases the calcium,
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.820]   which is what's needed for this entire
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.780]   cross-bridge interaction from the myosin and actin to happen.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.560]   I know a lot of, I just lost a lot of people,
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.620]   but you can go look at some of these images.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.000]   The sarcoplasmic reticulum gets activated more.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:43.840]   It gets more sensitive.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.540]   It is better at releasing calcium,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.080]   bringing it back in and doing it again.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.920]   The bond between the cross-bridge
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.640]   of the myosin and actin gets stronger.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.600]   The calcium affinity is the phrase that we use there,
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.840]   increases.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.740]   So we're literally walking through almost the entire process
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.080]   of skeletal muscle contraction here.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.680]   And every step along the way, we see improvements.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.600]   So that net result is we see, again, more force production,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.760]   independent of any change in size,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.320]   independent of any increase in contractile units.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.080]   We didn't add anything to the equation.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.580]   We didn't change size.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.640]   We did nothing but improve efficiency effectively.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.480]   Independent of that,
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.680]   now we can actually start talking
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.560]   about changing muscle fiber type.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.960]   So we can change our fibers from a slow twitch fiber
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.360]   to a fast twitch fiber.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.320]   That alone is going to give you more force production,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.640]   again, independent of size.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.800]   Fast twitch fibers tend to be larger than slow twitch fibers,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.960]   but not always,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.500]   especially in the presence of endurance training.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.720]   So if you do a lot of consistent endurance training,
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.960]   it's very common for us to find slow twitch fibers
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.720]   that are as similar size, if not larger,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.300]   often, very often larger than the fast twitch fibers.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.400]   - So big, slow fibers.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.520]   - Big, slow, very metabolically effective fiber.
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.680]   So extremely fatigue resistant.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.360]   So it's not a bad thing to call them slow.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.040]   It's like, we tend to say fast and slow
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.440]   and slow has this negative connotation,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.320]   but it's like quite healthy, like fiber type to have.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.160]   Outside of that,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.560]   now we haven't even gotten into things like panation angle.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.480]   So this is an angle at which your muscle fibers
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.940]   interact with your bone.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.180]   So we tend to think about this as like a muscle fiber
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.440]   is pulling on a muscle.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.860]   Well, some of these are oriented at almost a 90 degree.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.280]   So a fiber runs perpendicular into the bone
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.600]   and some of them are closer to like a 45 degree
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.840]   and some of them are closer to almost parallel.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.960]   And that confers a lot of unique mechanical benefits.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.480]   So in one area,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.520]   it's actually going to increase force production.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.520]   You go the other direction increases velocity.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.540]   And so we have all kinds of changes in the angle
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.800]   at which the muscle inserts into the bone.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   Now we're already on the mechanic side of it, right?
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.040]   So we've influenced how effectively it pulls.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.640]   And with any of these things, it's always a give and take.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.620]   So you're going to give up in the case of panation angle,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:52.760]   you're going to give up strength,
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.000]   but you're going to increase shortening velocity.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.440]   Or if you want to increase the velocity,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.320]   you're going to give up sort of the strength, right?
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.760]   We haven't gotten to any of the energetics at all.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.000]   So we haven't talked about increasing storage
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.280]   of phosphocreatine,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.120]   which is the energy system needed to power
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.180]   that muscle contraction at the fastest possible rate.
[00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.580]   So we could continue to go as long as you want here,
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.100]   but hopefully you're getting the point
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.360]   of a little bit of the adaptations that occur.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.020]   The reason I want to actually,
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.380]   why I think that stuff is important to bring it back,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.220]   maybe for some listeners,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.260]   I know I took you on a journey there
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.540]   and you're just like, what the hell just happened?
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.760]   That matters because again,
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.620]   this is the specific explanation for how is it possible
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.640]   that I got stronger, but I didn't get bigger.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.180]   And this is also why strength and hypertrophy
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.660]   are intertwined and heavily overlapped,
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.560]   but are not necessarily the same thing.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.280]   So for example, we can increase muscle size
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.480]   and actually reduce strength
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.660]   because of what's called lattice spacing.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.460]   So what happens is you have to kind of remember
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.700]   your muscle fibers are these long cylinders
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.300]   and the way that they contract requires an optimal space.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.300]   And so what happens is you have this molecule called actin
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.240]   and you have this molecule called myosin.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.840]   Myosin sits in the middle and there are six actin
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.600]   that surround each individual myosin.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.020]   In a three-dimensional circle here.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   So you got a myosin in the middle
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.420]   that has all these globular heads
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.980]   and they can reach up and grab an actin.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.220]   And again, there's six sort of around them, right?
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.120]   Well, one of the things that can occur is
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.160]   if those actin are too close together.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.860]   So imagine my hands,
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.280]   I'm reaching out and doing a giant T, right?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.480]   So I'm horizontal out there.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.940]   Well, if my fingertips are the tips of the myosin
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.860]   and I'm trying to reach up and grab an actin
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.700]   and I wanna pull those actins closer to my face,
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.720]   well, those actin stack on top of each other
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.200]   and that's what actually makes your muscles grow up.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.040]   Like if I flex my bicep,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.180]   it actually grows up three or four inches
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.120]   'cause you're stacking these sarcomeres
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:49.000]   or what they're called on top of each other.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   All right, great.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.820]   Well, if I'm reaching out to grab them
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.280]   and the muscle is stretched too far,
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.120]   I can't actually make that strong of a connection.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.000]   It would be like if I reached out and grabbed something
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.540]   but I can only reach my longest fingertip on it.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.380]   When I go to contract,
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.020]   I can't make that strong of a contraction
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.180]   'cause my grip is weak.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.340]   My grip's gonna break before I reach my strength limit.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.240]   If I'm too close, there's nowhere to go.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.080]   I'm already as close.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:14.740]   So if you actually disrupt that lot of spacing too much,
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.720]   you can actually lose a little bit of strength.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.660]   So it's not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.520]   It's simply that you're not optimizing for strength.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.380]   You're simply optimizing for size.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.400]   And so that can explain a little bit of the discongurity
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.140]   between growing and performance.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.400]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.860]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.520]   Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic,
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.000]   and adaptogen drink designed to help you meet
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.480]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.740]   I've been taking Athletic Greens daily since 2012.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.340]   So I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of this podcast.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.960]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.780]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.220]   once or twice a day is that it helps me meet
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.300]   all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.380]   That is, it covers my vitamins, my minerals,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.940]   and the probiotics are especially important to me.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.100]   Athletic Greens also contains adaptogens,
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.120]   which are critical for recovering from stress,
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.760]   from exercise, from work, or just general life.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.140]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.860]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman

[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.500]   to claim the special offer.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.780]   What are a few of the major changes that occur
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.780]   in muscle, nerve, et cetera when we experience hypertrophy?
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:39.540]   I've heard of protein synthesis changes.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.540]   I'm assuming that's true.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.920]   Maybe you can tell us a bit more about that.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.340]   Changes in blood flow.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:45.880]   - Yep.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.120]   - Perhaps changes in neural innervation.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.700]   Who knows, maybe even changes in fascia.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.460]   I'm not aware of any specifically,
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.060]   but I have to imagine that they're somehow involved.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.700]   - Sure, so when we talk about hypertrophy,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.880]   a lot of the adaptations are going to be similar
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.820]   because the mode of training is close enough.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.180]   So your nerves probably aren't smart enough
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.180]   to differentiate between a set of five reps
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.860]   or a set of eight repetitions.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.540]   They're smart enough to differentiate anything.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.420]   Like they know everything that's going on,
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.560]   but it's going to be a huge overlap.
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.020]   The primary difference with hypertrophy
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.900]   is a couple of things.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.680]   So if you think about the muscle microstructure,
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.460]   I have a whole series of videos on YouTube
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.860]   if you want to see the visuals behind this.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.500]   In fact, in there, I include the specific diameter,
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.660]   size of muscle fibers that I failed to give you
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.700]   a few minutes ago.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.500]   - We will provide an active link to those.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.700]   - Great, so what happens is this.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.620]   When we talk about, and you hear this classic buzz phrase
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.140]   of muscle protein synthesis,
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.140]   generally what we're talking about there
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.900]   is contractile units.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.300]   And so when we say contractile units,
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.940]   we're talking about the myosin and actin.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.680]   And so what we're really trying to do is say,
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.220]   okay, there's some amount of protein turnover
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.020]   where we're coming in
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.620]   and we're trying to add more proteins to the equation.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.980]   And so what has to happen there is a series of steps.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.760]   So step number one is there has to be some sort of signal
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.220]   from the external world.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.660]   This could actually, oftentimes it's things like
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.420]   stretching of the cell wall,
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.900]   which is what happens with exercise, right?
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.940]   So you're contracting, you're shortening,
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.740]   you get this big stretch of the cell wall.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.100]   It can come from simple things like an amino acid infusion.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.140]   This is just eating protein.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.940]   This is why protein ingestion alone is anabolic, right?
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.340]   It will help you grow muscle independent of even moving.
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.220]   - So just eating protein will grow your muscles?
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.140]   - Yeah, certainly.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.540]   And those data are very clear.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.060]   Of course, like anything, there's a saturation point
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.760]   in terms of total amount you need to get to
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.920]   and things like that.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.040]   But yeah, if you were to walk into a laboratory
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.620]   fasted overnight and I gave you 30 grams of protein,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.060]   we would see a very measurable increase
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.620]   in protein synthesis quite clearly for several hours,
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:50.460]   probably four to five plus hours.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.980]   We could maybe bring us some people
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.000]   that would know those data better,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.500]   but many hours later.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.340]   - With no weight training.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.180]   - Correct.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.940]   - I am betting that most people are not aware of that fact.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.100]   - You know what's actually interesting about it is
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.300]   if you do the exact same study again,
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.660]   and you just did strength training,
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.180]   you would also see an improvement in protein synthesis, right?
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.500]   But those factors are independent
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.780]   and the mechanisms are independent
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:12.220]   such that if you do them both together,
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.300]   they stack on top of each other,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.360]   which is really wonderful.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.360]   And if you were to add carbohydrate into that mix,
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.560]   now you're actually adding fuel
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.660]   for the entire muscle protein synthesis process.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.880]   And now you're going to see even additive benefits.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.440]   And this is why for so many years,
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.580]   this is what bore the whole post-exercise
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.720]   anabolic window thing,
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:32.400]   which is you got to get carbs and protein in post-exercise
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.000]   to maximize muscle protein.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.720]   Now that turned out to be not totally true
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.900]   in terms of being a natural window.
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.020]   - The window turned out to not be as strict
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.960]   as people initially asserted, as I recall.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.100]   But still, I think that's super interesting.
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.260]   These are parallel pathways for protein synthesis,
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:52.720]   simply eating protein or training,
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.680]   each independently increases protein synthesis.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.700]   I can't help but ask,
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.700]   is the same true if one does endurance type exercise?
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.900]   If I go out for a 45 minute jog
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.660]   where I can nasal breathe the whole time,
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.780]   but if I were to go any faster,
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.240]   I would have to kick over into mouth breathing as well.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.220]   So-called zone two-ish cardio.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.100]   Will I see an increase in protein synthesis
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.520]   as simply as a consequence of that jog?
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.620]   - No, this is one of the unique factors of strength training.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.460]   You're not going to see that.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.440]   In fact, it's difficult to measure protein breakdown.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.420]   That's been as extraordinarily challenging
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.260]   to do in the laboratory,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.180]   but you're not going to see those benefits.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.560]   In fact, you're going to see quite the opposite.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.600]   It's an entire molecular cascade.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.380]   So this is kind of how it works.
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.760]   So you have to have some similar signal on the outside,
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.980]   and this can be an energetic signal.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.700]   So this could be glucose uptake.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.260]   It could be protein intake.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.500]   It could be a physical stretch.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.140]   What happens is on the cell wall,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.940]   there's some sort of, it could be testosterone, right?
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.740]   Testosterone could bind to beta adrenergic receptors,
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.020]   and this activates a whole series of cascades
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.060]   of signaling proteins.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.700]   And these proteins basically play a game of telephone.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.820]   So one tells the next one, they tells the next one,
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.500]   and they sort of walk this entire way.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.980]   Well, that molecular cascade is fundamentally the same thing
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.520]   regardless of the insult, but there are different pathways.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.140]   And so the pathway from strength training
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.540]   or protein ingestion is going to go to the same nucleus.
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.300]   It's going to activate a whole set of gene,
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.740]   cascades that are going to tell you
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.180]   to go through this entire process of protein synthesis,
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:22.180]   which I'll walk through what that is in a second.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.420]   If you do endurance training, it's a different pathway.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.100]   And so instead of activating this entire thing
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.180]   of like mTOR and AKT and this anabolic signaling cascade,
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.940]   it's going to do a different one,
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.940]   which you can think of more of like as AMPK
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.140]   and energy signaling things.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.340]   So there's a crossover point here.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.980]   In fact, one of the things that you'll notice
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.980]   is mTOR and AKT don't really influence AMPK,
[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.620]   but there is some literature that years ago
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.220]   showed AMPK will activate another protein called TSC2,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.420]   and that will actually inhibit mTOR.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.760]   And that was the first molecular explanation
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.180]   for the quote unquote interference effect
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.780]   of endurance training on hypertrophy.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.160]   - Could you just highlight for people what this is?
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.100]   Because as you described these signaling pathways,
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.960]   I just want to maybe just put a top contour explanation.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.180]   The mTOR pathway is synonymous with cell growth,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:14.760]   both during development as organisms, humans included,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.660]   mature, and cells get larger.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:21.940]   mTOR is abundant in the system, to put it quite simply.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.780]   And then the AMPK pathway
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.380]   and some of the metabolic signaling that you were referring to
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.740]   is more synonymous with cardiovascular exercise,
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.620]   at least in the context of this discussion,
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.040]   and fuel utilization.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.800]   And what you described as a crossover point
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.820]   where certain forms of exercise
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.780]   can tap into both of these,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.480]   but at least for sake of this conversation,
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.780]   we're largely separating them.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.620]   - Yeah, because the by-product
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.360]   is the thing that matters here.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   So the result of mTOR and AKT getting into the nucleus
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.880]   is going to be increased in protein synthesis.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.640]   The result of AMPK running down to the,
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.880]   is going to be result in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.440]   So the net outcome is different.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:08.880]   Now, I do want to flag it very quickly.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   This is an extraordinarily complicated thing.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.920]   And in fact, in our laboratory,
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.720]   we were able to be one of the first
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.360]   that figured out how to measure
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.320]   all the different subunits of AMPK
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.640]   and individual muscles by fiber type.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.080]   - So you're ripping people's muscles out of their knees
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.200]   and their patellar tendons, just teasing.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.480]   They're gently removing under IRB protocol.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:33.040]   - Of course.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   So even when we say something like AMPK, it's not one thing.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.340]   And when we say things like mTOR, it's not one thing either.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.160]   It is, you have the total amount that matters.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.080]   You have the activation.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.460]   Activation sites are many of them.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.620]   So it's not as simple as what I'm laying it out.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:49.560]   I just want to get a big concept
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:51.120]   of kind of what's happening here
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.800]   to actually kind of answer your question, which is,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.680]   okay, so how is the muscle actually growing?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.280]   What you have to understand is a little bit
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.080]   of how protein synthesis occurs.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.240]   So what I'm generally meaning is
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.760]   you have a whole bunch of amino acids
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.240]   and this actually goes back to
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.060]   maybe like middle school biology class, right?
[00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.360]   So if you take a bunch of amino acids
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.040]   and you combine them together,
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:14.120]   we get these things called a peptide, right?
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.440]   And if anyone has ever heard of like peptides,
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.960]   that's all it really means.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.840]   You put a bunch of those together, you have a polypeptide.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.560]   You put a bunch of those together and we now have a protein.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.720]   So any protein I want to make
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.680]   is going to go through the exact same system,
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.060]   the exact same steps.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.320]   It doesn't matter if that protein
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.760]   is going to be a red blood cell.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.600]   It doesn't matter if that's going to be a hair follicle.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.120]   It doesn't matter if it's going to be skeletal muscle.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.640]   That's basically protein synthesis.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.640]   So when we tend to think of protein synthesis,
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.080]   we just paint this picture of growing more muscle
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.240]   and that's not the only thing.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.820]   And so when we talk about the benefits
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.540]   of having high quality muscle as being this place
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.420]   that's going to regulate most of your protein synthesis,
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.140]   we tend to lose some people 'cause they're thinking,
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.040]   oh, I don't need to gain muscle.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.360]   And that's not what we're talking about.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.320]   We're talking about regulating the immune system
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.440]   or we're talking about regulating any protein turnover.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.040]   So any protein that's degraded
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.160]   or needs to be broken down in your system at all.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:11.180]   Autophagy, this is such an important buzzword.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.880]   That's just protein breakdown of an unneeded
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.940]   or damaged protein, right?
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.360]   That whole thing is going to go through protein synthesis
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.560]   to be able to come back and replace the things.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.240]   The only reason you go through autophagy
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.520]   is so you can clean that garbage out
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.560]   and then come back and build in
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.840]   a more properly functioning protein.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.360]   So it's not just about growing more muscle mass,
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.400]   it's why you want these systems to be operating well.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.680]   So the protein ingestion is going to just activate
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.160]   that cascade 'cause it's basically saying,
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.400]   oh, hey, look, we have an abundance of supply here.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.720]   Why don't we make something out of it?
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.020]   Because we don't know the next time
[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.520]   this thing's going to be around.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:49.200]   Carbohydrates and fat are very easy to store.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.800]   Protein is very challenging, it's more transient.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.100]   And so you can store some of it and keep it around,
[00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.600]   but most of it you're going to lose.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.960]   And so when it's available,
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.540]   your body wants to act very quickly.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:01.680]   It doesn't necessarily care if you have extra fat
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:02.840]   floating around in your system.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.520]   It's all right, let's package it up and store it.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.080]   We can easily bring this back out.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.920]   But if you've got protein around,
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.080]   you're going to want to use it.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.140]   And so that's why it alone will activate
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.120]   and increase protein synthesis independent of exercise.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.140]   So those effects are additive, like I said,
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.800]   because that signaling process is independent.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.440]   And then once you hit a rate limiting phase,
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.360]   then you are there.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.160]   But at its onset, those things will work independently.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.560]   Okay, so that being said,
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.980]   what is skeletal muscle hypertrophy?
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.520]   In general, we think about it as
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.160]   this increase in contractile proteins.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.920]   So those myosin and actin effectively get thicker.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.560]   Okay, now what happens is since they are thicker,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.320]   and as I talked about a second ago,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.680]   that influences and actually hurts the lattice spacing.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.620]   And so what your body does as a result is say,
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.140]   hey, let's increase the diameter of the entire cell
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:52.020]   so that we can maintain our spacing between these things.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:54.100]   It's effectively like if the two of us
[00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.100]   were sitting in this room, and you doubled in size.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.580]   And I was like, whoa, you're in my personal space.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.640]   Like, and I doubled in size.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.020]   Now we're in each other's space.
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.180]   At some point, we just have to make the room larger.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.420]   And that's exactly what's happening in the cell.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:11.120]   And so as you can continue to increase muscle size,
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:14.200]   you're going to get myofibrillator accretion,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.940]   you're going to continue to increase muscle fiber size.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:21.260]   For years, there was this other comment about
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.780]   non-functional hypertrophy.
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.720]   And this was often called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.380]   Now, this is not sarcoplasmic reticulum.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.760]   This is a fancy way of saying my muscle is larger,
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.380]   but it has no function.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.540]   And the question would be, well, how the hell
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.620]   is that possible?
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.700]   If I have more contractile units,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.320]   and I can make more of these cross bridges,
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.940]   perform more of these power strokes,
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.740]   this is what these contractions are called,
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.340]   how could I possibly be losing function?
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.700]   Well, that was challenge for, that was bro science
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.080]   for a very, very long time.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.020]   And in fact, what it really came down to was,
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:53.500]   are there different types of hypertrophy training,
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.060]   some that induce contractile protein hypertrophy
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.660]   and some that induce the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:02.980]   And that was significantly challenged until recently.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:06.300]   Mike Roberts at Auburn did a series of wonderful studies
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.780]   that showed quite clearly that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy
[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:10.660]   is probably happening.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.660]   And in fact, there's probably a pretty easy explanation.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.340]   In general, what happens is it is a increase in fluid
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.380]   in the muscle fiber.
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.920]   And so this would allow for the diameter to be larger,
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.060]   but since there is no addition of contractile units,
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.080]   no more force production happens.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.340]   And so he actually has a wonderful review paper,
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.480]   I believe it's open access, where you can go look
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.620]   and he created a wonderful graph.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.260]   I think that's in my hypertrophy videos on YouTube as well.
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.940]   And you can actually see that it's likely happening
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.820]   in phasic changes throughout your training experience.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.660]   So at the beginning of your training,
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.000]   but as the years and weeks rather than months,
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.100]   and then eventually years go by in your training,
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.660]   we have a change in the hypertrophy
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.780]   that's coming from contractile units versus sarcoplasmic.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:58.740]   So I think that is an important note because again,
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.840]   people are wondering like, well, how the hell
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.620]   is it even possible for me to get larger muscle
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:03.540]   and somehow I'm not stronger?
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.580]   Well, if it came from simply fluid retention,
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.980]   and this is not bloating, this is not,
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.440]   there's no negative really to this.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.060]   It is simply holding of more hydration in the cell,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.540]   the hammer gets larger, and then everything works that way.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.940]   - Well, you just described calls to mind something similar
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.100]   in the nervous system, which is neuroplasticity,
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.060]   which of course is the nervous system's ability to change
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.540]   in response to learning and experience
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.980]   and damage for that matter.
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.460]   And we think about it as one term,
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.780]   but there are many different forms of neuroplasticity,
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.360]   a discussion that we don't need to get into now,
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.540]   but there's spike timing dependent plasticity and LTP
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.500]   and long-term depression,
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.760]   which has nothing to do with psychological depression
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.520]   and on and impaired pulse facilitation
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:44.820]   and on and on and on and short-term plasticity.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.060]   And so what I'm starting to understand
[00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.860]   is that there are many paths to what we call
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.020]   strength increase, and there are many paths
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.120]   to what we think of as hypertrophy.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.260]   Many of these are going to operate in parallel.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.800]   It's going to be rare that any one of them
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.320]   is going to be active alone
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.060]   in order to create hypertrophy or strength changes.
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.960]   And that certain forms of exercise
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.920]   and certain ways of doing exercises
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.260]   in terms of sets and repetition schemes
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.620]   and rest intervals between sets and between training sessions
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:18.460]   are going to tap into different mechanisms,
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.780]   but also overlapping sets of mechanisms,
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.220]   which is why, if I understand correctly,
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.220]   you mentioned at the beginning that often, not always,
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.420]   but often strength increases
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.880]   are associated with some hypertrophy changes
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.220]   and hypertrophy increases are often not always
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:36.580]   associated with strength increases.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.400]   Do I have that right?
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.240]   - Correct.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.460]   And the beauty of this whole thing is
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:44.020]   while we don't yet know the mechanisms specifically,
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.020]   and there's a lot of confusion
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.500]   and there's a lot of changes that happen.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.900]   We actually just submitted a paper a few days ago.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:54.740]   Myself, Jimmy Bagley at San Francisco and Kevin Muric
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.420]   has a wonderful muscle physiology lab at Arkansas.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:01.140]   And we actually, this is a very lay article, actually.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   It's incredibly easy to read.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   We describe the role of myonucleation in muscle hypertrophy.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.780]   And there's actually a lot of interesting stuff
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:11.600]   we can get into there,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.060]   but we're learning more and more about it.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.560]   As a quick example.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.660]   So skeletal muscle is unique in the fact
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.580]   that it is so large in diameter.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:22.880]   It's also unique in the fact that it's multi-nucleated.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.700]   What that means is typically in biology,
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.820]   you see like a cell has one nucleus.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   That's the place that houses and holds the DNA
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:31.020]   and it's the control center.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.660]   It does a degrow, shrink, dye, repair, that whole thing.
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.180]   Well, skeletal muscle in human is awesome
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:38.520]   because it has thousands, if not more of those nuclei,
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.660]   which gives it that plasticity.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.500]   And so a normal cell has one place it has to go to
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.020]   for any time it wants to up-regulate, down-regulate,
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.340]   do whatever the thing is.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:51.300]   Your muscle fibers have these little control centers
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:52.900]   all throughout them.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.620]   And for years, we were like, okay, great.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.420]   The amount of hypertrophy that you can experience
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.940]   is probably limited by the amount of nuclei you have
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.460]   because you're not going to exceed a certain size
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:08.300]   of muscle fiber if that's going to mean you lose control.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.720]   And so we're like, okay, great.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.020]   We've found and identified a limiting factor
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:15.140]   to what will determine how much a muscle can actually grow.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.060]   And then the next question was,
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.680]   and then where are these things coming from?
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.800]   And this is where satellite cells come in.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:21.220]   And so it was very clear a satellite cell
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.020]   that's lying dormant sort of on the outside,
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:24.460]   the periphery of the fiber,
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:29.460]   will then go into the fiber, it will turn into a myonuclei
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.740]   and then it can actually increase your diameter like that.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.720]   And so then actually it was like,
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.680]   hey, you're actually limited
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.940]   by the amount of these satellite cells
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.860]   you can get in and turn into nuclei.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:40.780]   And then the evidence came out that showed,
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.600]   hey, what if you detrain?
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.900]   So what if I used to lift weights like a long time ago
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.380]   and I got big, but now I've lost a lot of my muscle.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:51.580]   If I train again, you actually get that muscle back faster
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.260]   than it took you the very first time to build it.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.240]   Like that's what we call muscle memory, like an art field.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.180]   Now, on your side of the equation,
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.780]   muscle memory is something different, right?
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.620]   It's a nerve.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.380]   - Well, when people talk about muscle memory,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.820]   like the ability to ride a bicycle after so many years
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.760]   of not having tried to ride one,
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.060]   that's actually largely independent of the muscle,
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:10.900]   has something to do with the muscle.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.480]   - It's exclusively independent of the muscle.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.560]   - It's basically a nervous system phenomenon.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.400]   - 100%.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.560]   - So muscle memory has been co-opted
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.560]   by different communities to mean different things.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.520]   - Yeah, so on our side, muscle memory is going to mean
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.720]   that ability to remember that muscle size, right?
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:28.360]   That hypertrophy, because as you explained,
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.080]   the motor control thing is a totally a nerve thing.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.560]   That's the one, I'll give you this one.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.280]   You guys, the nerve people can have this one.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.880]   - Well, it seems to me that there are
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.240]   a tremendous number of parallels
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   between strength and hypertrophy changes and neuroplasticity.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.260]   This is coming up again and again in this conversation,
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.600]   because we know, for instance, that if you are exposed
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.920]   to a couple of different languages early on in life,
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.860]   you will learn any number of different languages
[00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.400]   far more easily later in life.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.240]   - Of course.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.060]   - And that's because there's some crossover
[00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.000]   between different languages,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.720]   especially Latin-based languages, that allows for that.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.940]   There's a substrate for it.
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.880]   It's similar to the ability to hop on a bicycle again,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.440]   phenomenon, or play an instrument phenomenon,
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.080]   but it's broader than that.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.560]   And again, I think this speaks to the huge number
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.160]   of different adaptive changes that are occurring
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   in the cells and in the nerves that innervate these cells
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.520]   when one experiences increases in strength and hypertrophy.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.800]   - So to round that out and to go back to what I was saying,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.500]   what we're actually learning now is that nucleation thing.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.360]   And by the way, this entire trajectory of story
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.200]   is probably over the last like eight years.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.880]   Like this is how fast we've changed our understanding
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.500]   of how muscle grows.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.320]   The sarcopod, in particular, I think five years ago
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.180]   was bro science, now it's pretty well established.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.420]   The myonucleation thing was eight to 10 years ago.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.500]   It's changing every week.
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   This paper we just submitted this week showed actually
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.500]   why we had generally thought a few years ago,
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.200]   and in fact, you can find me on podcasts
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.280]   and probably in some of my videos talking about this,
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.740]   and I'm gonna tell you right now, those things are wrong.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.200]   Like we've just had new things come out
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.040]   in these last couple of years where that detraining effect
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:04.840]   we thought was the reason of, well, what happens is
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.960]   if you had the muscle before and you brought in
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.680]   these nuclei and they differentiated
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.340]   and turned into a nuclei, and then the muscle got small
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.680]   again, you would preserve those nuclei.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.620]   And that's why when you go to train again,
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.540]   they were already around, so the muscle grows faster
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.180]   the second time than it did the first time.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.500]   Well, now it looks like that's actually not the case.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.040]   In fact, it's actually probably what's happening
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:31.980]   is it's a epigenetic change in the nuclei's ability
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.840]   to access the DNA needed to grow muscle.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.100]   It's effectively, the analogy we used,
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.960]   it's the nuclei are remembering how to ride a bike.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.220]   So it's quite funny that you said that
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:44.760]   because it's not really necessarily
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.440]   that they're being preserved over time.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.840]   They have learned the sequence it takes
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.040]   to grow the protein there, and it goes,
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.740]   it happens faster the second time.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.320]   And we've also learned that there are specific nuclei.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.800]   We've known this for actually a while.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.500]   We found this in our lab and we didn't discover it.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.560]   We saw this in our summer, however,
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.100]   but there are different shapes in the nuclei.
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.480]   Some are more oval, some are more elongated,
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.280]   and the shape determines a lot of the function.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.360]   Some of them are hanging out more towards the periphery
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.140]   and some of them are hanging out right around the nucleus.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.480]   Well, it looks like there's actually
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.800]   probably different types of nuclei.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.540]   A lot of them that are specific to the mitochondria.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.880]   In fact, you can see on some of the imaging we have,
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:26.600]   they're just packed around the mitochondria.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.900]   And there are some that are probably
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.920]   specific to injury repair.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.300]   And so this is probably explaining
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.040]   a lot of the individual variation.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.200]   I mean, I know you've said previously,
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.620]   like you're just a very, you're very slow at recovery.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.060]   There's a lot of things that go into that,
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:43.760]   and I would love to walk through sort of all the buckets,
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.020]   maybe later, into recovery.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.300]   But one of the inherent genetic variations
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.800]   is could be simply that you maybe have more or less
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.080]   of the nuclei responsible for tissue repair.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.100]   That's something that's been happening
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:56.700]   in the last handful of months that's been coming out.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:59.680]   We'll see if that holds up as true or not.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.140]   So as we're learning more and more almost every day
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.560]   about muscle physiology, what's super fun and interesting,
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.840]   and I think the most exciting, what to do
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.740]   in terms of like how to train and how to eat
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.320]   and how to do everything else to get these adaptations
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.440]   has been pretty well established for a long, long, long time.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.400]   We're just figuring out how like what's happening
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.080]   in the muscle now, but we know what to do.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.840]   So from a practical standpoint,
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.400]   putting together protocols for any outcome that you want
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.440]   or don't want for any modality.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.360]   You don't have a gym.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.000]   You have weights.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.160]   You have dumbbells only.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.580]   You only have kettlebells.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.720]   You don't want to, you only use body weight.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.700]   You only have three days a week.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.640]   You have seven days a week.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.260]   You want to maximize muscle growth.
[01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.040]   You want to get a little bit stronger.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.520]   Any of these variables you want to throw at me,
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.880]   we have a large evidence base for exactly
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.440]   how to get those adaptations and not others.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.760]   So while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.220]   and the physiology, we have pretty good legs to stand on
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.400]   in terms of what to do to get whatever adaptations you want.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.920]   - So what are the essential components
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.020]   of an effective strength and hypertrophy protocol?
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.500]   - Okay, so what I would like to actually do
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.520]   is walk you through both of those
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.800]   because as we mentioned before, they overlap,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:14.320]   but the training needs to be differentiated
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.400]   so that you can optimize either strength, hypertrophy,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.600]   or if you actually want, you can get a combination of both.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.080]   This allows you to then get the adaptation you want,
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.980]   avoid ones you don't want,
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.880]   and then get even a combination if that's the preference.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.040]   A lot of people will talk about,
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.780]   I want to get a little stronger, I want to add some muscle.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.680]   That's a different answer
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.140]   than someone who wants to truly maximize muscle,
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:35.980]   which is a different answer
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.720]   from somebody who wants to maximize strength,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.540]   which is a different answer
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.520]   from somebody who wants to maximize strength,
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.780]   but not actually gain muscle.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.380]   So we have all these combinations.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.600]   What's important to understand
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.280]   before we get into the details is a couple of things.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.840]   Number one, we've been teasing this concept so far
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.720]   of the concepts are few, but the methods are many.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.560]   And so I want to hit those concepts right now.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.320]   These are, as you say, these are the non-negotiables
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.280]   that have to happen in any training program.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.880]   And I'm referring to these
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.560]   in the strength and hypertrophy conversation,
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.180]   but these are true of power development, speed development,
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.160]   muscular endurance, endurance, any other thing.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.680]   These are things that just have to happen
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.520]   for any training program to work.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.600]   I mentioned one a little bit earlier, which was adherence.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.160]   And so my frequent collaborator, Dan Garner,
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.440]   will constantly say consistency beats intensity.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.040]   Again, in fact, the literature
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.560]   will show you very clearly adherence
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.320]   is the number one predictor of physical fitness outcomes.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.160]   So we want to do something that you will engage in,
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.840]   you'll put effort into,
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.560]   and you'll be able to repeat consistently over time.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.000]   So that's number one.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.720]   The second one is, and this is a major reason
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.440]   that people don't hit their fitness goals.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.000]   In fact, I would argue outside of not doing it,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.160]   the number one mistake they make
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.720]   is progressive overload.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.760]   So I'm going to walk you through
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.960]   exactly how much you should be increasing
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.360]   your sets and reps and weight, et cetera,
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.560]   per week, per month, later.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.460]   But that's the biggest thing.
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.880]   You have got to have some sort of overload.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.420]   The body works as an adaptation mechanism, right?
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:13.120]   So in fact, we talked previously
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.760]   about the Harvard Fatigue Lab.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.760]   And one of the things actually people don't realize
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.920]   is the concept of homeostasis
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.580]   is actually comes from research at the Harvard Fatigue Lab.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.200]   It was work that they did on an endurance runner,
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.520]   I forget his name.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.160]   And they sort of realized that after a long period of time
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.120]   working out, this is an acute exercise bout,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.600]   the body actually comes back to some stable place,
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.360]   despite the fact he was continuing to work.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.860]   And that's exactly what bore the phrase steady state.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.700]   And that actually, then they launched off and said,
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.780]   wow, there's this state that the body wants to be in,
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.100]   and we'll call this homeostasis.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.960]   So those all concepts came out of exercise physiology,
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.600]   which is really, really cool, right?
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.400]   We don't get a lot of love a lot of times scientifically,
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.980]   but that's a good one that we took.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:57.080]   So why that all matters is we have got to achieve
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:01.380]   some sort of overload without going excess.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.880]   So we'll cover that later of exactly what to do,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.940]   and we'll potentially get into overtraining
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.740]   and monitoring and things like that.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.480]   But you have to have some sort of
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:12.160]   consistent, predictable overload.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.480]   That's what's gonna cause adaptation
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.480]   to continue to cause stress.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.420]   If you don't do that,
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.680]   you can still do things like burn calories.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.900]   You can still get some of the other benefits of exercise,
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:24.620]   like improved mood, cognitive function, et cetera,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.880]   flexibility increases.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.440]   All of those can happen without a progressive overload.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.760]   But if you want to see these gains in strength
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.120]   and hypertrophy, you really need to progressively overload.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.000]   So that's concept number two.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.960]   The third one here is going to be individualization.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.120]   And this is where we can get into things like
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.600]   personal preference, equipment availability.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.080]   You have kettlebells or dumbbells,
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.480]   or you only have bands, or you have none of that.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.560]   These are all smaller details,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.700]   but that's an important component to it.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.420]   The last one I really want to get into
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:59.040]   is picking the appropriate target.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.160]   And we went through this when we talked about
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.220]   the fitness protocol.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.200]   And if you run through something like that
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.880]   and you run some testing and figure out
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.540]   where your biggest limitations are,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.540]   that's gonna help you identify where you need to go.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.020]   So if you can do all those things,
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:17.440]   you're going to be in a good spot to balance specificity
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.420]   and variation, all right?
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.820]   So if you want to make sure you grow your biceps,
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.740]   you better make sure your biceps are working.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.940]   Having said that, if you over rely on specificity,
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.620]   you're going to increase the likelihood of overuse injuries,
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.660]   which is going to come back
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.300]   and actually hamper consistency over time, all right?
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.680]   So this is when hedging towards specificity is important,
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.340]   but too much can cause a problem.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.140]   If you go the other direction and you go too much variation.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.460]   So imagine you're just sort of doing
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.580]   all kinds of different exercises every time you work out.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.500]   That's actually not enough stimuli
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.060]   directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern,
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.420]   if you're wanting to learn a new movement,
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.560]   to get you very far.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.540]   And so this is a classic problem of I'm doing a lot of work,
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.780]   but I don't have a very clear direction.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.100]   I lack specificity.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.940]   So I'm working, but I'm not seeing a lot of improvements.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.300]   And this is like in the business world, et cetera,
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.960]   this is like doing a whole bunch of different things.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.180]   It means you get nothing really done.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.260]   So that's the game we're going to play here, right?
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:15.480]   How do we overload this stuff?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.600]   How do we make sure we're balancing
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.040]   specificity and variation?
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.540]   How do we make sure I want to do this?
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.320]   And then how do I individualize it
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.720]   for my needs and circumstances and movement restrictions
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.260]   and of time availability and my calendar and desires
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.400]   and all of these things.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.960]   So those are the concepts we absolutely have to hit.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.600]   The methods that we choose run across a handful of variables
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.860]   and we call these things modifiable variables
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.700]   because as you modify them or you make different choices
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.140]   within these variables,
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.880]   you get different outcomes or adaptations.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.420]   This is exactly what determines the nine adaptations
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.540]   that we've been talking about.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.500]   So the way that I like to say this is exercises
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:59.180]   do not determine adaptation.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.840]   So you can't simply go, I want to get stronger.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.220]   Therefore, I'm going to choose these exercises.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.360]   That's not how it works.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.120]   What determines adaptation is the execution
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.480]   of the exercises.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.940]   So deadlift is my favorite example.
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.000]   A deadlift is a common example that people think of
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.520]   when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.260]   But a deadlift will not increase your strength
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:24.120]   unless you're executing it in the proper fashion.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.080]   I'm not only talking about technique here.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.700]   I'm talking about these modifiable variables.
[01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.420]   The same thing for power exercises.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.260]   We'll commonly see mistakes of doing activities
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.240]   like a box jump, which is great.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.200]   People think, oh, I'm going to improve my power,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.420]   which we know is extremely highly correlated
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.420]   to activities of daily living
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:45.760]   and particularly living unassisted as you age, right,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.440]   is reduction of power.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.040]   So they'll do an activity like a box jump.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.280]   What they're failing to realize is
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.500]   unless you do it powerfully,
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.960]   you won't actually increase power.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.840]   If you don't move fast, you won't get faster.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.580]   So the way that we manipulate these variables
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:04.200]   is everything to determining the adaptation
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.960]   you get or, again, don't get.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.580]   So with that foundation,
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.800]   I think we can kind of run right into these things
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.120]   and we can start off with perhaps speed and power.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.080]   And what I would like to do is walk you through
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.880]   all those modifiable variables, what to do with them,
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.500]   and then hit you with as many different methodologies
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.760]   as we really have time for.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.120]   And then we'll move on to strength and hypertrophy
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.520]   and kind of round the entire thing out.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.360]   And then maybe at the end,
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.000]   we can talk some other variables like
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.240]   what happens if I have a training protocol
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.720]   and I'm halfway through it and I can't finish my workout?
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.540]   What should I do?
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:42.640]   Reduce my weight or reduce my duration or things like that?
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.160]   So there's lots of what if scenarios
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:46.020]   that we can go through that potentially
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:47.960]   a lot of people listening have questions about.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   So, sound like a plan?
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.480]   - Sounds like a plan.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.880]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.480]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.800]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.440]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.040]   to help you better understand your body
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.920]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.440]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.800]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.660]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.800]   and wellbeing can only be analyzed
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.000]   from a quality blood test.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.320]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.740]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.960]   is that you get information back about various levels
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   of lipids and hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.920]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.500]   Inside Tracker makes knowing what to do
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.080]   with all that information exceedingly easy.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.840]   They have a personalized platform that lets you see
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.620]   what your specific numbers are, of course,
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.040]   but then also what sorts of behavioral do's and don'ts,
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.540]   what sorts of nutritional changes,
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.640]   what sorts of supplementation would allow you
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.380]   to bring those levels into the ranges
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.880]   that are optimal for you.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.260]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.920]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.280]   So, just to interrupt briefly and make sure
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.040]   that I and everybody else have in mind
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.560]   the proper nine adaptations that we've been referring to
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.180]   and that were discussed in detail in episode one.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:07.480]   I have listed number one, skill and technique.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.500]   Number two, speed.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.320]   Number three, power, which is speed times force.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.120]   Number four, strength.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.640]   Number five, hypertrophy.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.560]   Number six, muscular endurance.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.920]   Number seven, anaerobic capacity.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.320]   Number eight, maximal aerobic capacity.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.080]   And number nine, long duration steady state exercise.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.920]   - Yep, you nailed it.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.880]   Thank you for that.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.860]   It was probably important clarification for everybody.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:39.240]   So that being said, let's jump right into speed and power.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.640]   Now, I'll do these a little bit simultaneously.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.320]   They are different.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.840]   If you're a high performance athlete,
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.680]   you really need to separate these two things.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.160]   For the most people though,
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.200]   we can probably think about them as the same thing.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.100]   There's not a lot of pure speed training
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.960]   that the general public is interested in.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.700]   If you wanna actually further break down speed,
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.780]   there are multiple components.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.960]   There's acceleration, there's top end velocity,
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.740]   there's change of direction or agility and things like that.
[01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.980]   So we'll just kind of call them all that speed
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.080]   and power for now.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.680]   Now, at the onset, there's this three to five concept
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.040]   that we talked about many times
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.280]   where this is really fairly true
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   for speed, power or strength.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.440]   Now, I didn't develop the three to five.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.720]   It's just an easy way to help you remember one concept
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.320]   that will run true across all these things.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   So three to five refers to three to five days per week.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:37.820]   Pick three to five exercises
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.120]   and you're gonna do three to five repetitions per set.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.300]   You'll do three to five sets
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:48.180]   and you'll rest three to five minutes between each set.
[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:52.220]   If you do that and you execute any of the exercises
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.160]   that you choose at a high intent.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:57.040]   And that part is critical.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.740]   You don't get faster by moving kind of fast.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:04.180]   You can't improve power by moving like, eh, powerfully.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.020]   You have to be trying,
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:08.660]   regardless of whether you're actually moving faster or not.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.540]   Anytime you're talking about speed or power,
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.700]   you're by definition using sub-maximal weights.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.100]   So you're going to be able to lift it.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.320]   That's not the question.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.900]   The question is how fast can you lift that implement?
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.880]   And so intention is incredibly important.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.080]   So if you do that, the same for strength, by the way.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.180]   So if you land on that,
[01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.860]   that allows you to run the gamut
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.560]   from as little as three days a week.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.240]   You're doing three exercises.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.100]   You can do three sets of three,
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   which is a very, very low volume.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.640]   It's a very low amount of days, easy to handle.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.360]   All the way to five sets of five,
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.920]   of five exercises, five days a week.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.180]   So it's, again, it's just one sample.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.780]   That's something easy to remember
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.300]   and is quite effective for a very long time.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.880]   And this has been tested quite extensively
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.280]   in both the coaching realms,
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.640]   as well as the scientific realms,
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.240]   to be quite productive and easy to follow and grasp.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.260]   If you do that, all you need to do
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.940]   is slightly increase the load or the volume,
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.220]   but mostly the load over time.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.700]   And the number we want to look for there
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:15.400]   is something like a three to 5% increase per week.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.180]   So an example would be if you're going to do an exercise
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.280]   at a hundred pounds,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.500]   you can't necessarily just add five pounds every week.
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.000]   That's going to connect to you pretty quickly.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.020]   And so you may have to run a smaller increment.
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.920]   If you're doing like a lower body exercise
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.380]   where you might have a couple of hundred pounds
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.260]   on the weight,
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.120]   you can probably get away with adding five pounds
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.360]   'cause it's still a low percentage of the total load.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.940]   So that's roughly the guide that we want to get to
[01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.100]   for speed, power, and strength.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.060]   - So that sounds incredibly simple and effective,
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.700]   yet I have a number of questions.
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:52.700]   First off, if somebody is using the three to five approach,
[01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.780]   does that mean they should not be doing
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:57.780]   any other weight training of any kind
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:01.140]   in those workouts or at all?
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.020]   - No, you can certainly do that in combination
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.140]   with anything else you would like,
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.380]   especially if you think about speed and power.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.000]   Those are very non-fatiguing.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.380]   And so if you can imagine you're going to go to the beach
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.180]   and you're going to take a 10 pound to 20 pound
[01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.580]   medicine ball with you,
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.020]   and you're going to do four different exercises
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.220]   where you're throwing the medicine ball
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.740]   as high as you can in the air,
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.740]   four times in a row, taking a break,
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.060]   and you do two or three hits of that.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.940]   You do maybe three or four different types of throws.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:34.780]   That's very good for improving power, extremely good,
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.820]   but it's not very fatiguing.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.060]   So you could certainly finish that workout in 20 minutes
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.500]   and then run on and then do any number of other things.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.840]   So you could do some high intensity anaerobic capacity work.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.020]   You could do steady state stuff.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.660]   You could even do hypertrophy on top of that.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.760]   So there's two major categories
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.260]   of what we call periodization.
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.060]   There's many, many, many of them.
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.580]   But the two that have the most scientific literature
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:00.180]   are what's called linear periodization,
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.100]   and another is called undulating,
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.700]   or often daily undulating periodization.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.420]   And I'm flagging these two, again,
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.280]   despite the fact there are many, many, many more,
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.020]   because they represent two different concepts
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.100]   what you actually just touched upon.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.460]   So linear periodization is a hallmark
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.900]   by basically saying we're going to train
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.980]   one adaptation at a time.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.300]   So imagine going, say, six to eight weeks,
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.140]   and you're only doing strength,
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.460]   or you're only doing hypertrophy,
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:24.980]   or endurance for that matter.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:27.200]   So in that particular case,
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.260]   you would not do anything else in combination.
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.200]   If you contrast that to undulating periodization,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.500]   you would actually be doing multiple different styles
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.880]   of training, either within the same day,
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.120]   or just different days.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.380]   So it could be Monday is power, Wednesday is strength,
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:45.420]   Friday is hypertrophy, whatever.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.700]   Or it could be a little bit of strength every single day,
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.760]   a little bit of hypertrophy every day,
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.180]   a little bit of power every day,
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.720]   and you would just change the amount of each
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.220]   that you do within the day to alter the emphasis.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:59.060]   Now, if you look at the studies,
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.860]   and there have been many RCTs on this,
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.300]   the result of both of these training programs
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.660]   is generally basically the same thing.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.740]   They are equally effective.
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.660]   Here's the major difference, though.
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:16.260]   One, if your goal is very specific to one outcome,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.860]   you want to hedge towards specificity.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.540]   So if you're like, hey, I'm trying to maximize
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.980]   the amount of muscle I can build in the next eight weeks,
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.460]   then you don't really, anything else besides that
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.520]   is just distraction and potential interference.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.300]   Does it really matter or not doesn't matter,
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.420]   but it's not helping anything else.
[01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:36.200]   So linear periodization is fundamental at providing focus,
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.140]   and therefore the adaptations tend to be oftentimes larger
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.120]   in that specific area.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.360]   The downside is you now go six to eight to 10 weeks
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.040]   of doing nothing else, and so you are losing
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.960]   those other adaptations at a faster rate,
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.220]   and you can imagine doing something like speed work only.
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:57.540]   Again, speed work, by definition, is non-fatiguing.
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.540]   So when oftentimes we think of speed work as like,
[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.500]   oh, I did ladder drills, and I did all these things,
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.420]   and I threw up at the end.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.580]   But that's not speed work.
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.420]   You just did a different type of endurance training,
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.660]   okay, which is great and important.
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:10.700]   So true speed work is very high-rest,
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.680]   very low fatigue, and actually truly trying
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.540]   to reach a new level of speed or velocity.
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:16.620]   So non-fatiguing.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.240]   If you did that exclusively for 10 weeks,
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.900]   you would be pretty unfit by the end of it,
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.100]   'cause you would also lose a decent amount of muscle mass,
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.580]   not because there's an interference effect,
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.380]   but simply because of the fact you have not stimulated
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.520]   muscle growth for eight to 10 weeks.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.180]   And so neither one of these is better than the other.
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.940]   We're gonna see this classically across all program design
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.700]   or periodization strategies.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.520]   It's just a give and take.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.040]   There are tons of different systems,
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.800]   and perhaps at the end, we can talk about some
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.220]   of the more advanced periodization styles.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.180]   These ones are both effective.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.360]   You could do these with beginners.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.960]   You could do these with advanced athletes.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.240]   You could do them any of the spectrum,
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.380]   but they're some of the more well-documented ones.
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.820]   It's just a pro and con game, right?
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.040]   It's what are you willing to give up?
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.820]   The way that you solve that problem is going back
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.720]   to that fitness assessment and your analysis,
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.980]   and really, truly understanding what your goal is.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.120]   Is your goal to do a little bit of strength and a little bit,
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:15.160]   okay, great, maybe undulated periodization is an approach.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.040]   If your goal is really to maximize strength,
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.360]   and maybe you can wait on putting some muscle mass on,
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.880]   maybe linear periodization is a better approach,
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.080]   or another style of periodization
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.140]   that's optimal for strength gain.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.260]   So it's just simply about addressing your things.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:30.220]   One of the major problems folks have,
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.540]   in addition to lacking progressive overload,
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.160]   is they don't have any foresight past the next day
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.600]   of the training, right?
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.080]   And so it's really important that you set off blocks
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.560]   that are anywhere between six to 12 weeks long,
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.100]   where you're going to have the specific plan.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:48.400]   Ideally, you have an idea for the whole year.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.680]   I actually have like a structure
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.860]   I could walk you through for that.
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:52.920]   But even if you don't have that,
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.620]   really think about what you want the next 12 weeks,
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.240]   and then maybe the next 12 weeks after that.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.880]   And that's gonna give you a lot of guidance
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.960]   about what to do and what to focus on.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.000]   - Terrific, what about warming up?
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.040]   - I was taught that one should do higher repetition movements
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.640]   with lighter weights in order to warm up.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.540]   And then one of the things
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.360]   that did make a big positive difference for me
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.680]   in terms of strength and hypertrophy training,
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.600]   was to do a moderate repetition warm up
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.040]   with a fairly lightweight,
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.240]   but then to actually keep the number
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.180]   of warm up repetitions fairly low,
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.760]   and work progressively toward the first so-called work set.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.720]   When you say three to five,
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.540]   that's three to five work sets, correct?
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.560]   - Yep.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.880]   - Are you also gonna tell me three to five warm ups?
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.720]   - No.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.540]   - Are you also gonna tell me
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.960]   that it has to be done between three and 5 p.m.?
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.560]   (laughing)
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.400]   So in terms of--
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.760]   - With three to five friends?
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.440]   - In all seriousness, what does a good warm up look like?
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.480]   And I realize this will vary
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.780]   depending on how cool your training environment is,
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.820]   time of day, et cetera,
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.820]   but as a kind of umbrella for a good warm up.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.000]   - Okay.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.040]   - What should people do?
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.360]   - The, you've already sort of jumped the gun with my answer.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.120]   It is honestly very dependent upon the person.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:11.220]   So some folks respond very well to a minimum warm up.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.080]   Others, I've had lots of actually professional fighters
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.060]   I've worked with,
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.400]   where I actually have a Major League Baseball player.
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.760]   Right now, he's one of the best pitchers in the game,
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.080]   probably the best.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:24.480]   And the longer we warm up, the better his numbers get.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.360]   We actually did a vertical jump test with him.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.720]   He's gonna kill me 'cause he got so mad.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.680]   I wanted to see how long it sort of took him
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:32.880]   to reach a peak vertical jump.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.640]   And most times this takes people
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.920]   something like five to 10 sort of reps.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.500]   And I said, take it up all the way
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.920]   to a maximum vertical jump.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.540]   And then what I want you to do is continue to jumping
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.400]   until you have three consecutive jumps
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.920]   or you're down lower than 90%.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.800]   And so what we're trying to look at is sort of,
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.840]   when is he gonna break?
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.800]   'Cause in baseball,
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.480]   he's gonna throw like 100 pitchers or so.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.720]   And we're trying to figure out when is his peak velocity
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.080]   on his fastball gonna drop
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080]   and sort of basis conditioning on that.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.240]   It's a different style of conditioning.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.160]   It's power endurance is really what it is.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.560]   He called me in the middle of it.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.520]   I'm like, oh, you've done whatever.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.360]   And he's just like, no,
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   like how many of these am I supposed to do?
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.440]   And I was like, what are you talking about?
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.840]   He's like, I'm on rep 130 or something.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.680]   And I was like, what?
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.840]   And I'm like, what rep did you peak on?
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.220]   He peaked on rep 70, something like that.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.720]   69, I think technically, 'cause he's goofy.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.160]   So he's a classic example.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.560]   I've worked in for many, many years.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   We have a ton of data on him, a ton of biological data,
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.440]   a ton of neuro-muscular stuff, like all kinds of stuff.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.620]   And it just, the more he warms up,
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.320]   an absurd amount of warmup, the better he gets.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.200]   And the better he gets in power production
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.180]   and the better he gets in speed and velocity.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.040]   So his warmup prior to games is, it's totally absurd.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.040]   And just the more volume we throw at him, the better he does.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:48.260]   I have other folks, you get past like two or three reps
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.820]   and fatigue starts to set in.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.720]   And now you're actually like reducing power production.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.820]   So there is a ton of variation that goes into that.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.820]   I can give you some guidelines though.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.680]   You need to differentiate if you're training for speed,
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.480]   power, strength, or hypertrophy.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.040]   Here's why.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.600]   If we understand a little bit about
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.160]   what's causing the adaptation,
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:08.800]   that's going to tell you what you need to do or avoid.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.660]   For example, volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy.
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:17.720]   Intensity is the primary driver in speed,
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.480]   power, and strength.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.080]   All right, so what that means is,
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:23.240]   you need to preserve intensity for the first three.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.560]   You need to preserve volume in the second one at most.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.800]   So if your warmup is so extensive in the hypertrophy training
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.440]   that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue,
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.040]   even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise,
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.600]   then you're actually probably walking yourself backwards
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.760]   by doing that extensive.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.480]   You'd have been better off starting your first working set
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:44.680]   slightly suboptimal, right?
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:48.960]   'Cause you're just trying to accrue volume at that point.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.720]   Strength and power is the opposite.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.960]   Until you're moving very, very fast or powerfully,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.040]   you're not really causing the adaptation.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.840]   So there's no point in starting your working set
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.520]   until you're really basically at 100%.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.480]   So the warmup should be as long as it takes you to get
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   to where your mobility is in the right spot,
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.840]   like your joints feel good, you feel fresh,
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.840]   you feel activated, and you really feel peak power.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.160]   Anything before that is a warmup set.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.720]   In the sport of Olympic weightlifting,
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.760]   a lot of times the coaches will measure barbell velocity.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.160]   Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.040]   He's got a lot of data
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.280]   on what's called velocity-based training.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.680]   Brian Mann at Missouri and Miami, tons of work here.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.920]   And generally those communities are not going to count
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.800]   any repetition as a working set
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.740]   until you exceed 70% of your one rep max.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:40.160]   Where that's changed because of a lot of people
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.120]   doing the velocity-based stuff
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.520]   is now they're basing that simply on an achieved velocity.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.600]   And so really the warmup is irrelevant.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   They don't even, it's sort of just like do whatever you want
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600]   and we're gonna measure the barbell
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.200]   until you actually hit an outcome.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.280]   And now you're at what a working set.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.020]   So different ways to think about it,
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.640]   depending on what you're training for,
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.960]   that'll give you a little bit of a guideline.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.540]   If you're training for anything past hypertrophy,
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:04.280]   then really, and especially even hypertrophy,
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   it just comes down to, are you feeling ready to work?
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.480]   Are you cold?
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.380]   Are you moving through the correct positions?
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.260]   And if all those things are fine,
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.640]   I don't care if you start a little bit early
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.520]   and save some gas, especially if you're a person like you
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.920]   who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly,
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.820]   relative to Trevor who just has no response
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.480]   to fatigue whatsoever.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.240]   - Is it useful to do more warmup
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.960]   at the beginning of a workout,
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.120]   say before the first exercise,
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.160]   and then once one has achieved both local
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.800]   and systemic warmup, in air quotes,
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.800]   then perhaps on the second or third exercise,
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.300]   fourth exercise, et cetera,
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:50.160]   one or maybe even zero warmups?
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.480]   - Yeah, fair point.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:54.560]   We generally think about warmups in a couple of ways.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.040]   This is a very clever question.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:00.900]   You want to have some sort of general global warmup scheme.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.900]   We tend to prefer dynamic warmups.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.660]   So this is whole body movements
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.840]   rather than like sitting and stretching,
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.260]   static stretching, things like that.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.320]   - So something that involves momentum.
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.040]   - Yeah, momentum or movement, right?
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.840]   So this is like, think about this in like old gym class.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:20.080]   It's like your high knees and your butt kickers
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.240]   and just different things like that,
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.320]   where you're moving in different planes.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.480]   You're moving joints through tons of range of motion.
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.080]   You're getting a lot of movement there.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.960]   So you're getting the local warmup.
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.160]   You're also getting the total systemic activation.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.200]   Everything else is going on there.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.000]   So that is what would be considered to be a general warmup.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.880]   Five minutes is a very sufficient number.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.120]   Perhaps 10 if you're a slow goer,
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.240]   achy and some things like that.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.440]   And you really got to get the ankle warmed up
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:46.620]   if you're doing lower body stuff,
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:48.980]   really make sure that that's moving correctly.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:50.920]   The hips and knees will follow.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.460]   Upper body stuff really good.
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.240]   The shoulder blades and the neck,
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.440]   like making sure you're going there
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.480]   and the elbows will follow after that.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.960]   So five to seven minutes of a general warmup.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.320]   A lot of the times like classic exercise science,
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.200]   it will even just put you on a bike,
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.240]   cycling for five minutes.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.220]   I don't like that personally.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.440]   Dynamic movement is more preferred.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.040]   If you really just move five to seven minutes,
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.080]   you'll be fine there.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.680]   Now, specificity within each movement.
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.800]   It's very important that your first exercise of the day
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.280]   is generally the thing you've prioritize.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.300]   That's oftentimes the most important you're going to do.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:27.040]   It oftentimes is also the most complex
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.280]   and the most moving parts.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.500]   So it tends to be multi-joint,
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.720]   therefore you need to have movement precision
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.920]   and skill dialed, right?
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.160]   You don't typically start your workouts off
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.920]   with the forearm curl, right?
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.340]   Like that's, you don't need a tremendous amount of warmup
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:43.460]   to get going on that.
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.640]   You're going to start off with medicine ball throws
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.960]   or a snatch or some agility work.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.560]   You need to have the whole system going
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.880]   because multiple joints are moving,
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.280]   position matters, technique.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:55.580]   There's just a lot of skill requirement, et cetera.
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:58.720]   So the individualized workout
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.160]   or the specific workout for the specific movement
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.120]   for that very first one,
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.160]   my general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.160]   to move perfect in that first exercise.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.400]   Past that, you don't necessarily need
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.620]   to do individualized warmups for your next movements
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.680]   unless it is a movement you're trying to learn
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:18.680]   or just even get a little bit better at.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.280]   Like drop the load a little bit,
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.080]   work on some accruing some practice reps, fantastic.
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.300]   Or it's another dissimilar complex movement.
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.320]   So let's say your first exercise was a front squat
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.200]   and you got loaded for that
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.640]   and now you're going to move into a pull-up
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.960]   but your mechanics aren't the best there.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.720]   And so you really need to change
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.120]   and do some maybe more specific activation warmups for that
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.700]   or something else or it's running
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.080]   or something totally different.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.080]   So yeah, you don't need to rewarm up
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.200]   for every single exercise as you go.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.440]   Generally, once you're good to go,
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.820]   the same muscles that you're going to use
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.840]   in the next exercise are warm, same joints,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.600]   then you're good to go.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.440]   - You talked about intent within the movement.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   What about specific cadences for repetitions?
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:08.720]   - I was taught that one should lower the weight slowly,
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.040]   the so-called eccentric portion of the movement,
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:15.840]   and then to try and explode the weight
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.300]   through the concentric phase.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.400]   And then also make sure that one is using
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:26.360]   full range of motion and perfect form as it were.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.440]   Now, of course, that is one tiny slice
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.740]   of the possible rep cadences
[01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.640]   and ways to approach resistance training.
[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.120]   Although I think it's a pretty good one.
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.680]   What are the general parameter sets
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.880]   that one needs to consider?
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:45.200]   You could imagine lifting four seconds concentric,
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.200]   pause for one, pause for two, eccentric.
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:51.320]   I realize there's an infinite number of variations here,
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.060]   but is there a way to use rep cadence,
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.860]   repetition cadence that is,
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.720]   as a way to work through weak points
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.840]   and to be strong in every position of the movement?
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.380]   - Yeah, a lovely question.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:07.300]   I think the way I would like to answer this
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:11.960]   is maybe going back just a touch to get directly to that.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.980]   So I think if we walk through power, strength,
[01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.960]   and hypertrophy, and I hit you with the concepts
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.120]   that are specific to each one,
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.820]   that's going to lay out your answer
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.800]   because the most true answer there is
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.320]   it depends on the goal.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:28.340]   The answer for what is optimal for strength
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:31.660]   is diametrically opposed for potentially what's optimized
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:32.680]   for hypertrophy.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.260]   The same exact thing can be said for momentum.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.800]   So we've classically heard things like this.
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.040]   Don't bounce at the bottom.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.200]   You're cheating.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:44.480]   So if you're doing a lat pull down or something,
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.880]   you don't bounce and rebound.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.160]   You stop at the bottom, slow down.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:52.240]   All of these things are thought to be truisms
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.000]   of strength conditioning, but guess what?
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.560]   Those are all truisms assuming we're trying to grow muscle.
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.120]   And that actually goes back to our conversation
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.860]   in episode one about a lot of the things
[01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:05.360]   we think are just fundamental truths
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.840]   about strength training are just fundamental truths
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.580]   that came from the bodybuilding world.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.420]   And they're not wrong.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.580]   They're good ideas.
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:14.600]   But there are other adaptations one needs to get
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.120]   from strength training that are not just maximizing
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:17.960]   muscle growth.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.720]   So what I will lay out to you is a case
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.400]   for which you should bounce,
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:24.180]   a case for when you should go fast,
[01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:26.840]   a case for when you should be under control.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.500]   All of these things are different variables
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.400]   we can modify and get different adaptations for it.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.100]   - Is there a way that you could lay out for us
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:40.100]   optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:43.300]   versus hypertrophy specifically,
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:45.520]   just to sort of bookend the conversation
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.800]   and then migrate toward the middle in terms of rep cadences
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.920]   that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both?
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.400]   - We can get pretty close.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:56.640]   Yeah, so when you're talking about strength
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:00.200]   versus hypertrophy, remember strength is movement.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.520]   Hypertrophy is muscle size.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.060]   That's the key to your answer here.
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.780]   So when you're trying to get stronger,
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:08.680]   what you're effectively trying to do
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.520]   is get better at producing a certain amount
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.240]   of force through a movement.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.160]   Now force is mass times acceleration.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.300]   So what's the mass in the bar multiplied
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.020]   by how well I can accelerate it.
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:26.020]   Intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:27.980]   Right?
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:32.580]   So it's hard to argue that going slower
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.660]   is going to improve strength
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.080]   'cause you're simply reducing acceleration.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:42.080]   So you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.220]   Now, does that mean if you're trying to get stronger,
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:47.820]   there are no phases of your training
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:49.280]   in which you will slow down or pause?
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.680]   No, of course not.
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:53.160]   There are certain rules in different organizations
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.260]   where you have to pause the bottom.
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.300]   Like there's all kinds of little things like there.
[01:34:57.300 --> 01:34:59.180]   But in general, we wanna think about
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.900]   what are we trying to do here?
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:04.500]   We're trying to get better at moving a heavier mass
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.100]   at a faster rate of acceleration.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:09.180]   That is more force, that is more strength.
[01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:11.540]   Hypertrophy is not that.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.860]   The goal here is not a functional outcome.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.580]   It is what is needed to cause
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:18.100]   the most amount of hypertrophy.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.580]   And when you get to hypertrophy then,
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:23.100]   your optimal cadence is up to you.
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:24.300]   You can do any combination.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.540]   In fact, you could do it the same exact cadence
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.940]   that you did your strength training with
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.860]   and get the same adaptations as hypertrophy
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:34.460]   if you modify the other variables appropriately.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.820]   Or you could go slower.
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.900]   Or you could do pauses.
[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.740]   Or you could do a thing that is called triphasic training
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:43.940]   where you spend the first phase,
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:45.160]   several weeks of your training,
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.000]   where you do eccentrics only.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.860]   So you're just lowering the bar and you're basically stopping.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.700]   You could then do the next phase of your training,
[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:52.880]   which is isometrics.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.860]   You're just holding at that bottom position.
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:56.060]   And then the next phase of your training,
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:58.440]   you're focusing on the concentric portion of it, right?
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.500]   Triphasic, one, two, three,
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.960]   eccentric, isometric, concentric.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.100]   So that's a fantastic way of developing actually strength,
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.580]   a little bit of hypertrophy,
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.460]   but you're manipulating the variables
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:11.260]   in terms of how you execute the repetition range.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.980]   You can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy
[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:16.100]   moving the weight fast, as you mentioned,
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.260]   even down, slow, under control.
[01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:20.540]   Now, one thing one will never advocate
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.760]   is moving any sort of weight or load uncontrolled.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.500]   The assumption here, when I'm saying go fast,
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:27.000]   is you're always in control.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.720]   I never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:30.740]   with a barbell if it does.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:34.060]   But you can move at a lot of rates.
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:35.160]   The isometric I mentioned,
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.280]   because this is when things like
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.560]   body weight training come into play.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.920]   Absolutely, you can gain strength.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.140]   And even a little bit of hypertrophy,
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.520]   especially in the upper body, doing isometrics,
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.000]   is much harder to do this with the lower body.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.480]   You outrun that coverage really quickly.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.700]   You need load.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:52.620]   But there's a lot of ways.
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:54.520]   This is also probably why people have done things
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.060]   like gone to yoga only, or Pilates,
[01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:59.760]   or some of these things that are body weight based,
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:00.720]   and there's no external load,
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.320]   and they've actually increased muscle size.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.920]   - So I'm getting the picture there are a ton of options
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.760]   in terms of rep cadences.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.800]   However, can we say that one should pick
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.940]   a given rep cadence within an exercise,
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.280]   rather than changing it from set to set within an exercise,
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.420]   or that one should perhaps even pick a certain rep cadence
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.160]   for an entire workout?
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.920]   I'm suspecting that your answer is going to be, it depends.
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.820]   - Yeah, it is.
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.720]   - But if, you know, I'm not going to use the,
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:30.220]   if you had a gun to your head kind of situation,
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.060]   but if you had a gun to your head,
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:35.400]   what would be the rep cadence that you would prescribe
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.420]   for strictly strength or as much strength
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.420]   with as little hypertrophy as possible?
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.720]   And in picking that rep cadence,
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:45.680]   then it therefore has to thread
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.300]   throughout the entire exercise bout.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.320]   - So you're actually right.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.480]   You can, because of that undulating periodization stuff
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.760]   I talked about, you can actually do this in a lot of ways.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.020]   So you could do one exercise at the beginning
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:58.440]   where you have a set cadence,
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:01.400]   say a three, one, one is like a very one.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.260]   - So that's, so that's lifting for three,
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.060]   pause for one, lower for one.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.760]   - Generally the opposite.
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:09.780]   - Okay, so the first number is always the eccentric.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:10.620]   - Generally.
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:15.360]   - Okay, so lowering the weight for a count of three,
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:16.640]   pause for one.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.840]   - It totally depends on the exercise.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.440]   Like a deadlift starts comp centric and finishes eccentric,
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:21.600]   but a bench press starts the opposite.
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.680]   - Okay, so it's start to finish.
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.200]   - Start to finish is the better way to think about it.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.220]   Yeah, so I'll clarify actually.
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:29.160]   When we say three, one, one,
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.340]   we're generally talking about almost always
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.720]   the eccentric is the slower portion,
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.880]   regardless if it's the first or the last, right?
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.800]   So whether you're doing a bench press
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.840]   where the eccentric is lowering the bar to your chest,
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.480]   that's the first part of the movement.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.020]   One, two, three, pause one, one up,
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.600]   which means accelerate as hard as you can on the way up.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.920]   That's what you described.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.660]   - Right, as opposed to say a row.
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.200]   - A row, which is actually gonna be starting off concentric.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.760]   So you're gonna be pulling that thing to your chest
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.240]   as fast as you can under control,
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.180]   not slamming off your chest, holding for one second,
[01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.120]   and then taking three seconds to lower it back on the rack
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.400]   or on the ground or whatever.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:07.500]   So the reason we do that is somewhat intuitive,
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.500]   but it is, again, to make sure you're not advancing a bar
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.780]   or an implement onto your physical body
[01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:13.800]   at an extremely fast rate.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.120]   That's very difficult to deal with.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.980]   So a three, one, one is a very standard strength protocol
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:22.800]   that is something you can just run with.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.240]   If that's all you ever wanted to do,
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:25.540]   it'd be absolutely fine.
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:27.800]   - Lower the bar for a count of three.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.400]   It actually ends up being approximately three.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.240]   - It is super.
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.660]   - Partly anybody is counting off seconds precisely.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:36.560]   I mean, I suppose it's doable, but then pausing briefly.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.820]   - Yep, and that brief is almost,
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:42.780]   that pause is almost unmeasurable.
[01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.800]   It is simply, are you under control
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.620]   before you transition from the eccentric to concentric
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.760]   or contact to each other?
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:49.660]   It's just a safety thing.
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.500]   So once you feel down, you've reached complete range
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:53.220]   of motion, you're ready to transition, then just go.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.340]   You don't really need to go like thousand one
[01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:56.180]   and then go up.
[01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:57.000]   It's just making sure, again,
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.480]   we don't slam weights off of body parts.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:02.440]   - And that final one in the three, one, one
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:06.360]   is the execution of the usually concentric portion
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.300]   of the exercise.
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:08.900]   - Yep, as fast as you possibly can.
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:12.940]   - Okay, so that would be for the majority
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.240]   of the outcome being strength.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.080]   - Yep.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:19.240]   - Okay, and of course we should acknowledge, again,
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:22.140]   there are a ton of variations that one could implement there
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:24.060]   but that would be a good starting place.
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.900]   On the opposite side, for somebody who's mainly interested
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:30.240]   in hypertrophy, what would be the rep cadence that,
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.980]   if you had a gun to your head, that you would prescribe?
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.500]   - I would probably do the exact same thing,
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.600]   but I would make the last number two.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.760]   So three, one, two.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   You could also just keep three, one, one.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.800]   It is still very fine.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.300]   Even exploding on the contract is still highly effective
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:51.140]   for training hypertrophy.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.740]   So if you want to keep it super simple
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.320]   and just make rep cadence not a variable
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.120]   that you play with, 'cause you have other ones to move,
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:57.960]   that's great.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.020]   If you want to add a little bit of time
[01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:02.460]   to the concentric phase, fine.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.200]   It's not gonna do, it's not going to make enough
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.680]   of a difference for most people
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.400]   for you to really worry about.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:12.440]   I guess that's sort of the point I really want to make.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   This is, we're classic, this is a classic example
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:16.920]   of we're deep into a method, right?
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.220]   If as long as you hit the concepts I talked about earlier,
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:21.280]   whether you want to do three, one, one, three, two, three,
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.780]   three, three, three, three, triphasic,
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.120]   this is just a method choice.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.920]   It doesn't mean they're irrelevant.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.940]   There are subtle changes within them.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.560]   It's just 80/20 rule, right?
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.120]   So 80% of the benefit is gonna be from the concept.
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.880]   20% is this small thing.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.920]   If you're super into this field,
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.440]   or you actually want to work with a qualified,
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.280]   certified coach or something,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.960]   there's lots of reasons to play with this.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.720]   If you're just on your own here and running this thing,
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:46.960]   three, one, one is fine.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.560]   Three, one, two, totally fine.
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.040]   Anything like that.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.520]   You really just want to make sure
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.440]   that in the strength side of the equation,
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.680]   you're under control and you can add enough load
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:02.640]   to stimulate strength and not get hurt with an acute trauma,
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.460]   right?
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.880]   On the hypertrophy side, you're just wanting to load enough
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.460]   to where you can hit volume,
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.560]   'cause you got to put a lot on there.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.400]   So if you want to go lighter, if you want to go slower, fine.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.160]   If you go slower in your repetition,
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.640]   so maybe even like a five second eccentric,
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.520]   a two second pause, a three second rise, that's great.
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:23.320]   You can actually then stimulate the same amount
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.960]   of hypertrophy and either do it with less weight
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.680]   or do it with less repetitions.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.640]   So it's a variable you can play with if you're like,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:35.180]   hey, I don't have enough weights at my house
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.620]   or I only have a kettlebell or a dumbbell.
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:39.740]   How am I going to stimulate hypertrophy?
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:41.740]   Your only option is really doing more reps.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:45.120]   Well, eventually that train runs pretty shallow.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.660]   Okay, here's the thing you can play with.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.640]   Maybe just add time under tension,
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.260]   is what we're calling it, right?
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:53.180]   Just do slower repetitions, go longer ones and hold it.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:56.300]   So it's a variable that we use to individualize programs
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.140]   rather than something that you should really be focused on
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:00.660]   as like a core aspect that's going to be driving
[01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:02.340]   whether or not your program works.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.900]   It's just a tool we can play with in the what if scenarios.
[01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.660]   I will use this stuff a lot when I'm traveling.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:11.260]   You can do a tremendous workout in your hotel room
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:13.500]   just doing like a 10 second eccentric,
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.700]   a 10 second hold, a 10 centric concentric.
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.280]   - Yeah, I've had some decent hotel room workouts.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.340]   They're not my preference,
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:25.340]   but by simply doing things like 10 second
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:28.820]   lowering handstand pushup against the door.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:29.800]   - Totally.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.720]   - Obviously assisted for me,
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:34.300]   I can't do a free handstand pushup.
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.620]   I just don't have the skill or the strength or both.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:39.860]   You can do some sort of configured dips
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:43.280]   between the beds or chairs and this kind of thing.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.620]   - Rear foot elevated split squats are great to do in hotels.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:47.660]   Put your back foot up on a bed
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:50.100]   and get an amazing split squat workout done.
[01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:51.780]   Yeah, glute bridges, lots of stuff you can do there.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:52.780]   - Yeah, and with a jump rope.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.520]   If you've ever heard someone jumping in the morning.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.300]   It may or may not have been me.
[01:43:58.300 --> 01:43:59.200]   It could be any number of things,
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.500]   but I am known to skip rope in hotel rooms.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.140]   Not to get overly detailed,
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:07.680]   but I think there are going to be a number of people
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:12.180]   wondering about how to breathe during repetitions
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:15.180]   and how to breathe in between sets.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.780]   So I'd like to just briefly touch on this
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:17.900]   and this is something that I know
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.240]   we're going to return to again
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.500]   when we have our discussion about recovery.
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:25.060]   But is there a general rule of thumb
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:29.340]   for how to breathe during repetitions, during work,
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:32.860]   for strength, maybe even strength versus hypertrophy
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:36.980]   in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system,
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.260]   keeps you alert and conscious,
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.520]   but that also protects the body
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.980]   by creating some rigidity in the system, right?
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.580]   Because certainly being deep with all your exhale,
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:51.540]   the body is a very different beast in terms of stability
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.300]   than with the body full of air
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:55.940]   versus breathing during the repetition movement.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.180]   - There's a maneuver that has long been labeled
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:02.000]   the Valsalva technique.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.860]   So what that really means is you're trying to use air
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:06.900]   to create intra-abdominal pressure.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.100]   And what you're really trying to do
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:11.260]   is create a cylinder around your spine.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:13.380]   The real issue you have to play here
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:17.300]   is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.860]   Now you should be able to breathe and brace.
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.260]   What I mean by that is you should be able
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.640]   to create total intra-abdominal pressure,
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.740]   regulate spine control while breathing.
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:28.340]   It's just very hard for a lot of people to do.
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:30.980]   It's a skill you should absolutely work on.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:32.980]   You can actually, you can do this and you can go around.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:35.260]   Like I do this trick in class and students can come
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:39.640]   and I can push any part of my entire abdomen super tight
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.480]   and I can talk.
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:41.540]   Now it's gonna be a little bit labored.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:42.780]   You can hear a little bit of a difference,
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:44.180]   but you should be able to do that.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.020]   If you have to like hunch down
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:48.180]   and you can't even muster a breath
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.600]   and it takes that to create pressure,
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.340]   you're not actually, you don't really understand
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:56.740]   the abdominal control necessary to create that stability.
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:59.260]   So step number one is that's the goal.
[01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:00.420]   Now with the blood pressure thing,
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.580]   we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure,
[01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:06.040]   ideally, if we sat around right now,
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:08.340]   it was probably something like 120 over 80,
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.960]   systolic versus diastolic.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.460]   That's a normal number, right?
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.360]   High blood pressure is something over that.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.900]   Well, with an acute bout of exercise,
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.300]   you can see that number reach as high as like 450 over 350,
[01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:21.780]   which effectively means you have total blood occlusion.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:22.820]   Right, your blood pressure is so high,
[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.900]   blood is not moving anywhere.
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.560]   And so in the middle of a very heavy set,
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.320]   especially complex movements,
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.740]   especially when they're loaded on your body,
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:33.060]   this could be an overhead press or squat variations,
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.460]   anything like that, blood pressure is gonna be a problem.
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:36.440]   And the reason why that matters
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:38.080]   is that's what's gonna make you pass out.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.720]   It's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.940]   in three seconds.
[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:42.680]   It's the fact that blood pressure got so high,
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:43.860]   you blacked out.
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:45.660]   And so we're gonna have to play this game
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:47.180]   of releasing a little bit of the pressure
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:49.480]   so we can actually get blood to move a little bit,
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.660]   making sure that we don't lose spinal stability
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.600]   so we can finish our workout.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.260]   That's really the question you asked, right?
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.220]   How do I play this game of,
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.960]   oh, I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.540]   and I don't wanna exhale, right?
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:04.900]   So that I don't lose spinal stability,
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:07.260]   but at the same time, I don't wanna pass out, right?
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:08.300]   Which is a problem.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:10.580]   So kind of a couple of rules of thumb.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:11.980]   If you're going to be doing something
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:14.420]   in which you can complete the entire exercise
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.940]   without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load,
[01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.700]   that's probably your best strategy.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:20.620]   So in that particular case,
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.780]   you'll see a lot of breathing techniques
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:25.200]   where you're gonna take a very large inhale.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.300]   Ideally, this is done through the abdomen,
[01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:28.260]   not the shoulders.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:31.220]   So we shouldn't have seen clavicles rising during this thing.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:33.780]   You'll see a common mistake of the bars on their back
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:36.000]   and you see people do this like big inhale thing
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.140]   and all they do is elevate their clavicles.
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:40.300]   That's not necessarily going to increase pressure
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:41.900]   through the abdomen, which is what you're looking for.
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:44.240]   So you wanna be thinking about belly moving out
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.220]   in all four areas, in front of you,
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:48.380]   to your left and right and to your back.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:52.000]   That's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.920]   You can do that independent of your clavicles moving.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.000]   Your shoulders don't need to rise for that.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.540]   You don't really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes.
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.640]   You're just using the air for a brace.
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:04.860]   That's really all you're after.
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.660]   - So you're trying to visualize your torso
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:09.140]   as more or less a cylinder.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:09.980]   - Yep.
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:11.980]   - And you're trying to fill it with air,
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:13.860]   the logic being that if I were to push down
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:18.860]   onto a full unopened can of soda water,
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:20.740]   for all you sugar-phobes out there.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:21.680]   - Soda water.
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.700]   - And then push as hard as I could.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.920]   It's gonna be hard for me to crush that can,
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.320]   but if the can were empty
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.780]   or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle,
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.820]   then I could likely crush that can.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.780]   - Yeah, what you're really doing
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:37.200]   is you have your spinal erectors in the back, right,
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.240]   and then a whole series of abdominal exercises,
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.160]   and you actually have some neural control,
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.140]   somatic control of contracting those.
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:47.920]   But you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do.
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.300]   So you're basically bringing in air
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.800]   and saying I'll use air to push from the inside out,
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.920]   and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:55.200]   to create this brace.
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.800]   And I don't want over-compression with the muscles.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.520]   This is, like if you see people
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.400]   that have just enormous spinal erectors,
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:05.540]   sometimes that's an indicator of actually a poor breathing
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:06.960]   or bracing strategy,
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.160]   because they're using spinal erectors
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:10.200]   to create all their compression
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.040]   and not actually using the inside of them.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:12.900]   That's not always the case,
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.760]   but sort of like a thing to think about.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.580]   So over-compression through the spinal erectors
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.480]   is not necessarily ideal.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:21.640]   If you wanted, the best scenario
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.200]   is a little bit of a brace of both.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.640]   So we use some air to push this side,
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.560]   we use some musculature to press that way,
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:31.600]   and then that spine is nicely held in position.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.960]   Again, not in a position where I've locked down my diaphragm
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.660]   and I can't get any air out.
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.440]   I should be able to get that brace pattern
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.280]   and then be able to speak.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.240]   Like I'm doing it right now.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.760]   And you'll see like a little bit of a,
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.580]   if you're really paying attention to my voice,
[01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.440]   you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference,
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.720]   but I should be able to do this for quite a long time.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.320]   Right, like I could take a maximum rep right here
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.640]   in this position, whether I'm overhead pressing,
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:54.520]   doing some sort of row, like anything,
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:57.620]   and feel very braced in the entire quadrant.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:00.100]   - This is very helpful.
[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:01.780]   I'm going to work on it,
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:06.260]   but can we say that an effective way to start off
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:08.360]   in terms of breathing during repetitions
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.800]   would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase,
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.640]   the eccentric phase,
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.800]   and then to exhale during the concentric exertion phase.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.160]   I ask that because that's what I've been doing for a while
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:22.200]   and it makes me feel safe.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:25.200]   I don't know if I am, and it allows me to exhale
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:30.160]   as I exert the hardest portion of the exercise.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.000]   And perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000]   where one most often is trained to exhale on the strike.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.860]   If you're going to be doing, again,
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:41.560]   the number of repetitions can be completed
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:44.560]   without a breath, a lot of times you're better off
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:47.360]   saving that exhalation until you complete.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.480]   - Wow, but- - But you don't have to.
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:50.960]   - But for a reasonably heavy set of hack squats
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:52.160]   or even leg extensions,
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.000]   and given that I already can't leg extension
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.300]   my body weight as we establish- - Maybe this is why.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.640]   - Yeah, maybe this is why.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:03.780]   The idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set-
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:06.480]   - So again, I'm clarifying. - Brings to mind,
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.760]   you know, like, where's my insurance card?
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.880]   Who's going to drive me to the hospital?
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:12.520]   This kind of thing.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.600]   In all seriousness, what if I want to breathe during the set?
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.220]   - Yeah, so I'll clarify.
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:22.080]   I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one rep max
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.040]   or something like that.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.580]   - Okay, well then certainly I could hold my breath
[01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:26.140]   for a one repetition maximum.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:28.620]   - You know, maybe like a double or something like that,
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:31.240]   depending on what you're doing, like maybe a triple.
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:33.520]   A bench press, you can probably do three
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.360]   and get away with it.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:35.720]   A squat, it gets harder, deadlift.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.360]   So it kind of depends on the exercise.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.040]   You want to take that breath though
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:42.680]   prior to the eccentric portion, not during.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.460]   So breathe in, lock, we're set,
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.120]   and now start our movement pattern, wherever it's going to be.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.400]   Exhaling on the concentric portion during it, it is fine.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.240]   It's no problem, especially if you're not extremely heavy.
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:59.080]   - And what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming?
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.440]   - Yeah, fine, I don't care.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.480]   - I don't tend to do that.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:04.420]   I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper,
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.980]   but I do it very quietly.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.220]   - I think of you and I think squeal, whimper, absolutely.
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:10.500]   - Thanks.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:12.960]   - If you're going to be doing multiple repetitions,
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:15.600]   what we actually do for the NFL Combine
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.500]   is we teach them a very specific Excel strategy.
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.920]   So there's one test that they do,
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.720]   which is they bench press 225 pounds
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.040]   for as many reps as possible.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.100]   A lot of these people will get 25 to 40 repetitions.
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.640]   So we have a very specific breathing pattern.
[01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:27.520]   It would be something like,
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.160]   if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps,
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.260]   say that's like our goal, we might say,
[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:36.120]   okay, do the first 10 without a breath, and then exhale,
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:38.320]   reset, and then do five breath.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.400]   And then you might do five breath, three breath,
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.400]   two breath, and then one breath per rep
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.860]   until we can't get any more.
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:47.740]   So we'll have very specific strategies for them.
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:49.240]   So what I would say is think about
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.080]   how many you're going to complete,
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.680]   and then breathe according to that.
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:55.800]   And it tends to increase in frequency
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:57.600]   as the number gets closer to failure,
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.400]   'cause you're gonna want that air a little bit.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:01.680]   But you just wanna make sure that
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:05.740]   when you're breathing back in, you're in a safe spot.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:07.540]   So you don't wanna be catching that like,
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.300]   re-breath when the weight's on you.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.800]   You wanna be in a locked out position
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:13.920]   or away from you when you're standing.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:16.500]   So it tends to be like at the end of the exercise,
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:17.740]   not in the middle of it,
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.980]   which is going to be a recipe for problems
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.380]   if you take your breath then.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.680]   - One of the reasons I'm so happy to have you here,
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:28.180]   having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds,
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:30.960]   but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:31.940]   - Yep.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:36.020]   - How does one contend with the first attempt at a lift
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:36.900]   not working out?
[01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.700]   Is it too heavy?
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:42.000]   Something goes wrong, hopefully not injury promoting wrong,
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.400]   but something goes wrong.
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.240]   Do you count that?
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.440]   Do you reset the workout?
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:50.260]   And then the counterpart to that question is,
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.820]   what do you do if it's too easy?
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.860]   It went wrong because you didn't put enough weight
[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:56.100]   on the bar, didn't pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells.
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:59.900]   Do you abandon the set and replace it with another?
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.380]   And I guess this is really a question of
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.900]   how much margin for error is there in volume
[01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.980]   when doing this three by five program?
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:08.980]   - Sure.
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:11.520]   Two things that I'd like to start with.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.980]   Number one is I talked about linear periodization
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:14.900]   and undulating periodization.
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:17.260]   There's actually a new model, newish model
[01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.940]   called auto regulation,
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.420]   which basically says you're going to go in today
[01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.160]   and depending on any number of biomarkers,
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.520]   performance markers, or your performance,
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:28.820]   you will adjust your training based on
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.540]   how you're feeling that day.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.820]   And so 70% is not maybe, for example,
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:36.380]   not necessarily 70% of your one arm repetition max
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.380]   highest ever.
[01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:40.420]   It's 70% of what you can actually do that day.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:42.400]   And so it actually allows you to auto regulate
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.260]   your training based on actually what's happening.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:47.140]   And so you don't have to have as much long-term planning
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:48.380]   in your program design
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:51.660]   because it'll sort of figure itself out as you're going.
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:54.480]   You can use velocity to determine this auto regulation.
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:56.640]   You can use actually, it's like taking it up
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.460]   to close to a max for the day.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:01.660]   And then basing all your percentages on that daily max
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:02.580]   or a lot of different ways.
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:05.440]   So that is actually one very effective strategy.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.500]   And there's a lot of research coming out on auto regulation.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.740]   There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:12.380]   So that's one thing to say.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.960]   Another thing to say is this, three to five, okay.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:19.020]   It depends on if we're going for speed, power or strength
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.200]   because while all those other variables
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.980]   are the same for three to five,
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:26.100]   the core difference between whether that is a power workout
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:29.760]   or a strength workout is the load, right?
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:31.540]   So if you are at a moderate load,
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:35.840]   say 30% of your one repetition max up to about 70%,
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:39.140]   that's going to be a power-based adaptation,
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:41.700]   assuming you're going with high intent.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:44.460]   - Can you, sorry, I have to interrupt.
[01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:46.680]   Maybe just clarify what intent is.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:48.860]   - Yeah, you're attempting to move the implement
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:51.700]   or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can.
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.920]   - Great, thank you.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.740]   - If you're trying to go for strength
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:57.580]   and you're below 70%,
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.420]   you're not really going to be improving strength
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:02.940]   because the total mass is not heavy enough.
[01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:04.580]   And so really when we say strength,
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:09.500]   we're assuming you're at at least generally 70% or higher.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.940]   Now, if you're new to training,
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:12.780]   totally different thing, right?
[01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:15.320]   But if you're moderately trained to highly trained,
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:17.340]   you're going to be well north of 70%.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:19.500]   So anything below that, we don't really count anyways.
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.540]   Those are warm upsets basically.
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:25.760]   So one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.780]   here, and I don't have all of these memorized.
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.700]   We can perhaps provide a chart later
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:32.580]   or send out something to them.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:34.000]   But there's a chart that you can look up
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.840]   called a pryllipin chart.
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:36.900]   - How do you spell that?
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:41.720]   - P-R-I-L-I-P-I-N, pryllipin.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.100]   And there's actually been a few studies on it.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.460]   It's been around for a very long time.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:48.860]   It's sort of in the coaching realm.
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:51.680]   And then a handful of studies out of New Zealand came out
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:53.580]   in verifying and validating a lot of it.
[01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:56.460]   But what it effectively does is if strength is the goal,
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.240]   and this comes from the powerlifting, weightlifting
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.920]   sort of communities who are optimizing for strength,
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:03.860]   then how much time do I need to spend
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.580]   at each intensity range?
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:08.860]   So 70%, 80%, 90%, et cetera.
[01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:13.060]   Because specificity is going to say this.
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:16.140]   If you want to get better, neuromuscular guy,
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:18.480]   at shooting a basketball, the most important thing
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.800]   you could ever do is shoot a basketball.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:22.060]   Under the exact circumstances
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.180]   that you're going to do it, right?
[01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:25.080]   Specificity always wins.
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.020]   If you want to get better at strength,
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:28.900]   the most important thing you need to do
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.980]   is that exact movement at that load.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:32.700]   And in this case, if you wanted to get better
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   at your bench press, lifting at 100% of your max
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:39.780]   on a bench press is the most specific thing
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.660]   you could ever do.
[01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:43.620]   The more you can do that, the faster you will increase
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.980]   your bench press max.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:48.900]   However, that's very hard to do without getting hurt.
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.440]   It's also not addressing what I call your defender.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:54.480]   So if the reason you can't bench press
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:56.600]   higher than whatever you're benching now,
[01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:58.080]   it may not be your pure strength.
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:57:59.840]   It may be any number of things like
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:02.500]   you don't have enough muscle or technique or these things.
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:03.340]   Okay, great.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:05.000]   So specificity over here.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.940]   Variation on the other side.
[01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:09.660]   So we're playing this game we've talked about
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.640]   of how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.640]   in my training without leading to overuse injury?
[01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:21.420]   How do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:22.700]   while getting enough specificity?
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:25.060]   And so we have a classic paradigm over here.
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:27.340]   One actually training protocol you can look up
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.100]   is called the Bulgarian method.
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:32.020]   And the Bulgarians were amazing
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:33.900]   at the sport of Olympic weightlifting.
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:38.900]   Probably, in fact, the patriarch of this entire thing
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.360]   recently passed away, Ivan Ibejev.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.160]   Niamh Suleimanoglu, pocket Hercules,
[01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.620]   one of the greatest weightlifters of all time
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:47.620]   came out of the system.
[01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:48.780]   And they do a lot of things.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.200]   But one example in the Bulgarian system
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:54.780]   is you're going to do a one repetition maximum snatch.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.140]   You're gonna take a little bit of a break.
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:58.140]   You'll do a one repetition maximum clean and jerk.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.260]   Take a little bit of a break.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.500]   Do a one repetition maximum front squat.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.380]   Take a little bit of a break.
[01:59:02.380 --> 01:59:03.780]   And you're gonna repeat that two to three times
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:04.620]   a day every day.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:07.300]   That's specificity, right?
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.900]   Those people get extraordinarily strong.
[01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:11.180]   Now they don't do that all year round.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.500]   They don't do that with all their lifters.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:14.420]   But this is when we're trying to peak
[01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:16.020]   for a major competition like the Olympics.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:19.700]   We are going so far into specificity.
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:22.320]   And that was very counter to the Russian system at the time.
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:23.720]   Which is much more of our classic
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:25.820]   periodization sort of approach.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:27.720]   Okay, specificity is tremendous.
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:30.740]   But in doing that, the Bulgarians just brutalize
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:31.740]   a lot of athletes, right?
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:33.720]   'Cause it's very difficult to handle something like that.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:35.280]   And you can't really do that that long
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.360]   without getting wrecked.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:37.940]   - And there the goal is to win medals.
[01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:39.620]   - The goal is, it's a totally different thing
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:40.900]   than longevity out of here, right?
[01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:42.940]   Like we're trying to push the boundaries of--
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:44.660]   - Or aesthetic changes.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:46.900]   Unless someone has a naturally balanced physique.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:47.740]   - Totally. - In general,
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:50.140]   if people do one sort of movement,
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.220]   I find that they tend to resemble the equipment
[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:54.320]   that they did that movement with over time.
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:55.160]   - Right.
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:56.340]   - That was a joke against kettlebells.
[01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:59.000]   - Of course, of course, of course, I got it.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.740]   So we know specificity is technically optimal,
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.020]   but it's not realistic.
[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:07.380]   Not for that kind of a extreme situation.
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:08.720]   So how do we balance these things?
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:10.520]   Well, it turns out this Parillipin chart
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:12.940]   gives you guidelines for how much time,
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:15.340]   and by time I mean how many repetitions,
[02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:18.660]   to stand in each of these rep ranges
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:20.740]   so that you get kind of the best of this world.
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:22.240]   You're gonna find the same thing, by the way,
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:24.020]   when we get into endurance training.
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:26.060]   There's only so much training you can do
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:27.620]   at 95% of your heart rate,
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.780]   before it starts becoming quite detrimental.
[02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:31.500]   You need to actually spend a lot of time
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:33.740]   at those lower intensities.
[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:37.420]   So the Parillipin chart walks you through how many sets,
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.740]   and it gives you a range.
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:40.920]   I think that the bottom of it is like,
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:43.380]   how much time do you spend at 60 to 70%
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.220]   of your one-rep max?
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:47.060]   And it says a minimum of this set to a maximum of this set,
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.140]   but the ideal number of reps per set per week is 18.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:50.980]   And then it walks you through,
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.660]   and so there's four criteria on it.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:56.180]   I think it's 55 to 65%.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.260]   Again, how many reps there?
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:59.540]   It's like three to six reps per set.
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:04.020]   18 to 30 reps total,
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:07.420]   and I think the ideal rep range is 24, something like that.
[02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.660]   So it gives you a 55 to 65, 70 to 80,
[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:12.200]   80 to 90, and the 90 plus percent.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.560]   And what you'll see is the 90 plus percent number
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.580]   is more like one to two reps per set
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:20.820]   for a total of about seven total repetitions.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:22.880]   If you start cruising past that,
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:26.440]   other bad things start to creep up in there.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.540]   So that's a really effective chart.
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.800]   What it really highlights though,
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.880]   is even somebody who's trying to maximize strength,
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.940]   you're going to spend something like 35 or so percent
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:41.640]   of your training time between this like 55 to 65% range.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.540]   So you're asking, you're like,
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.860]   "Well, do I even count that one?"
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:46.260]   The answer is yeah, in that range.
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:50.540]   If it's below 55, 60%, you probably don't count it.
[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:51.860]   Now, again, some coaches don't count
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:53.460]   unless it's even above 70.
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:55.340]   Fine, it's not a major distinction,
[02:01:55.340 --> 02:01:57.860]   but you're going to spend the bulk of your time
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:00.340]   accumulating some technique, basically,
[02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:03.220]   and skill and tissue tolerance, very important.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:05.900]   The next step up is like 28%, I think,
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:09.060]   is sort of the cutoff of how much time you spend
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:11.440]   between 70 and 80% of your one-hour max.
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.580]   And then it jumps down to like 23%,
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:15.100]   and then all the way to 70%.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:16.380]   So you can walk yourself through that,
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:18.980]   and that gives you an extremely good guideline.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:21.220]   And you'll notice all of these
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.020]   are still in the three to five range.
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:25.460]   It's just really, you're manipulating it by total sets
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:26.340]   or total exercises.
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:29.240]   So that can give you some structure to play with.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:32.980]   - We will provide a link to the Prilopin chart
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:34.340]   in the show note captions.
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.380]   Training to failure when the goal is strength.
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.580]   - Yeah.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:41.220]   - Should one do it?
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.900]   Should one avoid it?
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:43.980]   Or does it depend?
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:45.800]   - Well, yeah, it always depends.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.340]   The way that I'll generally say it is
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:49.660]   because of what we just outlined in the Prilopin chart,
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:52.440]   you don't have to go to failure to see strength things,
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.620]   especially early or even moderate.
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:56.860]   And I'm talking maybe five plus years
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:58.340]   in your lifting career.
[02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:02.060]   - Would you call beginner zero to five years of training,
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.600]   intermediate five to 20 years of training?
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.940]   - Yeah, something like that.
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:08.040]   - And then advanced would be people
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.380]   that really put the time and energy
[02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.920]   into fine tuning their program.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:12.880]   - The vast majority of people who think they're advanced
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.880]   are really what we would call intermediate.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.700]   - In all domains of life.
[02:03:16.700 --> 02:03:19.800]   - Fair, even as a scientist.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.860]   It's quite rare to reach that number of advanced.
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:24.100]   So I actually don't have any problem
[02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:26.320]   going to failure quite often.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.500]   I'm also fine with people
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.100]   who don't wanna go all the way there.
[02:03:29.100 --> 02:03:30.760]   You can get most of what you need
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.060]   getting what we call technical failure.
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:37.140]   So this is like, okay, that was really challenging.
[02:03:37.140 --> 02:03:40.740]   Boy, you started to have some breakdowns of technique.
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:41.980]   We're gonna call that good.
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:45.320]   The only exception here I wanna point out
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:49.080]   is people who are either novice or beginners,
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.520]   they really have no concept of what 100% means.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.920]   And so I think it's actually very fruitful
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.340]   to take them to 100% just to give them a guideline
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:00.240]   of where it's at.
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:03.080]   Now, of course, do this on exercises that they are
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:04.660]   comfortable with or close,
[02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:07.300]   and maybe this is on a machine,
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:09.340]   maybe this is single joint movements
[02:04:09.340 --> 02:04:11.060]   or whatever it takes for them to have confidence.
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:13.600]   But actually, I don't think you should be scared of these.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:16.440]   They're not really that much more dangerous
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.640]   than anything else.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:18.640]   I mean, think about it.
[02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:21.680]   If you're gonna do a front squat or any exercise
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.880]   and your one rep max is 200 pounds,
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.060]   is it really that much more dangerous
[02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:29.000]   to do one try at 205 pounds
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.600]   than it is to do five tries at 190 pounds?
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:33.920]   Like, is it really that much more?
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:34.760]   No, like it's not.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:37.680]   So you can do, like we talked about in the first episode,
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.320]   you can do a repetition max estimate
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:44.720]   where you get to like 85 to 95% of where you think you are,
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:45.800]   and then instead of adding load,
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:47.960]   you just do as many reps as you can,
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:50.000]   Google that number and that'll tell you the conversion
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.080]   and estimate of what your one rep max is, that's fine.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.480]   But also, I have absolutely no issue.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.760]   In fact, I generally encourage it
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:58.280]   to pick people up to that level.
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:01.040]   Certainly not day one or anywhere close to that,
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.880]   but at some point, let's see what you actually got.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:05.720]   I'm just gonna cut it off early.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:08.200]   What I'm gonna consider to be one rep max,
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.180]   anything more than a minor technical breakdown
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:13.400]   is for that group, we're gonna stop and call that good.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:16.720]   - And ideally with a spotter, especially bench pressing,
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:18.680]   don't bench press alone in your basement kind of thing.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:19.960]   A few people die each year
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:21.960]   from bench pressing alone in their basement.
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.600]   Or use dumbbells if you're gonna do that.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.040]   It's harder to die using dumbbells.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.720]   I suppose you could drop them on your head or something,
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:31.560]   but not get stuck under them.
[02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:37.800]   Exercise selection and frequency of exercise implementation
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:39.340]   across the week.
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:42.760]   So I can imagine with this three by five routine
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:45.720]   done three to five times per week,
[02:05:45.720 --> 02:05:49.200]   you can imagine changing up the exercises every workout.
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:53.320]   Although considering that most of these three by five
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.640]   routines are going to be done with compound movements.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:57.160]   - Generally.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:59.900]   - Sooner or later one runs out of movements
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:03.960]   if the goal is to hit all the major muscle groups.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.960]   However, let me give an example and ask if it's okay
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.120]   to for instance, do the three by five routine
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:15.200]   where one of the exercises for back is say a bent over row.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:19.640]   You do that on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, okay.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.400]   I can imagine one could do that and still recover
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.820]   and improve over time.
[02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:27.140]   But five days a week, bent over rows five days a week,
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:28.500]   is that okay?
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:30.780]   I mean, can one still progress?
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:35.820]   And there I could imagine it's a strong answer of depends
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:39.300]   because some people recover more slowly than others.
[02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:42.260]   I'm very comfortable doing hitting muscle groups
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:44.420]   once directly per week and once indirectly.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:46.580]   That's worked for me far better than
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.420]   two or three times per week.
[02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:50.680]   I get looks of sympathy when I say this,
[02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:54.200]   but it's actually, it's just how my physiology works.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:55.040]   - Kind of.
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.640]   - Yeah, well, and maybe I'm not optimizing
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:57.680]   a number of different features.
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:00.380]   But the point being that some people really do seem
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.560]   to be able to train a muscle every day
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.040]   and still make progress.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:07.600]   Other people seem to have trouble
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.960]   when they train a muscle every day.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:12.400]   So how does one establish exercise selection
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.120]   when the goal is to make progress?
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.080]   And this brings up something very important
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:19.080]   and we're gonna have a whole episode about this,
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.520]   but local versus systemic recovery.
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:25.320]   Is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued?
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:28.600]   And is the muscle group
[02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:31.880]   and the related musculoskeletal systems becoming fatigued?
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.380]   - We're gonna go back to thinking about,
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:37.360]   when you make these comments about
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.720]   it takes you three to five days
[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:40.760]   and you've got better results in there.
[02:07:40.760 --> 02:07:43.360]   The assumption that you're probably running under
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:47.120]   is your training style is more reflecting
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.200]   that recovery time than it is your physiology.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.980]   It's not you, it's how you're training.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:56.160]   So if you look at, again, all the Olympic weightlifters
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:57.680]   that are competing, they're gonna be squatting
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.860]   or some variation of squatting every day.
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:02.400]   That's gonna happen.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.600]   A lot of the times they're training multiple times a day.
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.780]   And they will be doing some basically barbell full squat
[02:08:07.780 --> 02:08:10.800]   multiple times a day, every day, six days a week,
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.560]   something like that.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.800]   They're the best in the world at getting powerful.
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:17.000]   They're tremendously good at getting strong.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.360]   You can do it, right?
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:22.400]   It comes down to what does your volume look like?
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.580]   What type of movements are you doing?
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:25.960]   What rep range?
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:28.320]   What overall volume are you hitting?
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:29.160]   And how are you doing it?
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:33.000]   If you look at athletes, they train their legs every day.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.760]   When they're running around,
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:37.800]   they're doing speed and agility training every single day.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:40.060]   They don't need three days to recover.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:41.640]   Can you imagine a basketball player trying to ask
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:43.280]   for like three days to recover between practice?
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:46.340]   - Right, well, to be fair, as you chuckle at me,
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:49.180]   I'm doing other things on the intervening days.
[02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.420]   So I'll train a muscle group like legs,
[02:08:51.420 --> 02:08:54.180]   and then I'll give it four days before I do an indirect,
[02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:57.880]   what I call an indirect exercise for legs,
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:08:59.680]   which for me would be sprinting.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:02.360]   Then I get two days and then I'm training them again.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.440]   - But nonetheless, an athlete has to do that every day.
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:05.280]   - Right. - Right?
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.500]   So the answer is you absolutely can train
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:10.880]   any of these muscles every single day.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:13.600]   It really comes down to volume, right?
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:16.280]   And it comes down to movement type.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.120]   And how are you getting it?
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:20.120]   So in the case of weightlifters and athletes,
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:23.840]   what we tend to see happen is there's two things.
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:26.520]   There is a long period of conditioning,
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:27.440]   and I don't mean endurance.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.500]   What I mean is tissue tolerance and conditioning.
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.320]   So they're not going to start off their career
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:33.240]   at that pace, right?
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.520]   Their career might start off at five days a week,
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:40.800]   but maybe every other of those days is a PVC pipe only.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.400]   And you're just training the movement patterns.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.160]   You're working on technique, et cetera.
[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:47.080]   And then eventually, maybe after six months or a year,
[02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.160]   those PVC pipe days turn into barbell only days.
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:53.160]   And so now you went from a pound to 45 pounds.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.000]   And eventually as your years go on, that wraps us up.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000]   So it depends on the style.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.980]   In general, speed and power stuff is so light,
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:03.360]   it almost requires, because it's non-fatiguing,
[02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:05.600]   it requires almost no recovery.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:07.540]   So if you were truly doing, say like,
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.640]   it's funny, because when you say I do legs on Mondays,
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:14.560]   you don't even realize it.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:17.040]   But an athlete does legs every day, right?
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:17.880]   But you're saying legs,
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:18.880]   and what you're really saying is,
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.400]   I do hypertrophy legs Mondays.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:22.680]   - Pretty much, I don't want to get into what I do,
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.400]   specifically, because it's less important
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:26.000]   than what other people choose to implement.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.080]   But the repetition ranges anywhere from four to 12.
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:32.840]   - Correct, so you're smack dead
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.080]   in the peak soreness, longest recovery range.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.960]   - Volume is relatively low intensity,
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.000]   very, very high.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:39.840]   Workouts are very, very short.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:41.600]   - So if you were to switch that,
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.200]   and you were to stay under four repetitions,
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.340]   higher quality, higher rest in between them,
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:49.040]   I would be willing to bet a large amount of money
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:50.400]   that you'd be fine the next day.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:52.120]   Certainly 48 hours.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:54.280]   And if you were to actually go way lower,
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.360]   and keep, you know, three to five,
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:57.940]   and keep it very, very light and trained for speed,
[02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:00.780]   you would have absolutely no issue the next day.
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:02.460]   So it really comes down to a function of training.
[02:11:02.460 --> 02:11:03.840]   You're right in that hypertrophy zone,
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.060]   which is something that you probably need 48 hours
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:08.520]   at minimum to recover from.
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:13.080]   Because what you won't see are bodybuilders
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:15.740]   training the same muscle group on multiple days,
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:16.580]   like very often.
[02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:18.140]   At most, it would be indirect.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:20.420]   But generally, they're not going to do that every single day
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:21.260]   for the same reason.
[02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:23.520]   So you're training in that style,
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.680]   that's what it's gonna take to recover.
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.600]   If you trained in a different style,
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:28.400]   then it wouldn't take that long to recover.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.160]   - So for the person starting out,
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:33.580]   would you recommend they pick three to five exercises
[02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:36.440]   and stick with those so that they can get their skill
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:39.040]   and movement and positioning and breathing,
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.200]   all that really dialed in,
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:43.620]   and then start to experiment by varying one or two
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.320]   of those exercises over time?
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:46.160]   - That's great.
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.960]   If you look at the conjugate model,
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:50.300]   so these are the strongest powerlifters
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:52.280]   as a collective group that ever existed.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:53.480]   What they're very good at is they keep
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:55.580]   almost the exact same weekly structure,
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:58.920]   but they make a very small change in exercise variation.
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:02.040]   So for example, say Wednesday is bench day, right?
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.980]   They're going to always bench on Wednesdays,
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:06.660]   but maybe this week they're going to do close grip bench.
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:08.060]   And then maybe next week it's going to be
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.700]   maybe a special type of barbell.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.740]   And then maybe the week after that,
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:15.920]   it's maybe they'll change the range of motion a little bit.
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:17.600]   So it's actually the exact same exercise
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:19.100]   where they're making a very small variation.
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:23.000]   And that change alone allows them to do enough specificity,
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.460]   but also gives them enough variation
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:26.260]   to where it's not the exact same stimuli
[02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:28.940]   in the exact same spot over and over and over.
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.940]   And that's what allows that group,
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:33.700]   plus lots of other assistance,
[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.140]   but it's what allows that group
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:38.540]   to train very, very, very heavy, very consistently,
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.800]   and not have to worry about too much planning
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:42.820]   for periodization and other stuff like that.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.020]   They get their back off
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:46.060]   by making small variations in exercise.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:49.260]   I will say a major mistake folks do make
[02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:52.560]   is they change their exercises entirely way too often.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.780]   If I were to have to pick one or the other,
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:57.380]   I would say don't change anything
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.340]   on your exercises for six weeks.
[02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:02.180]   Probably realistic, maybe even 10 to 12 weeks.
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:03.860]   And then you can make some changes.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.620]   You should not be changing every single week.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.620]   The general public, you're not gonna see progress.
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.020]   It's gonna be very difficult to do that.
[02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:13.340]   So it's going to take you three weeks, generally,
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:15.060]   to figure out the groove of the exercise,
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:16.940]   to figure out how well you can load it,
[02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:19.580]   what's too much to where you woke up unbelievably sore,
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:22.380]   that was a train wreck, how much do I load it at,
[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:23.760]   what position, how long was this gonna take?
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.460]   It's gonna take you three or so weeks.
[02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:27.600]   And then you can really start pushing there.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.140]   So changing it before that or in that timeframe
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:32.540]   is you're not gonna be able to progressively overload
[02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:34.140]   'cause you're just not gonna know exactly where you're at
[02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:35.140]   on all the exercises.
[02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:37.900]   So it's very important to create standardization
[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:40.980]   within them and then see some progress in a movement
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:43.300]   or a muscle group, whatever you're going for,
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:45.240]   and then make some changes.
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:48.620]   - So before we dive into our discussion about hypertrophy,
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:53.300]   can we just get a brief recap of the general parameters
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:56.740]   for an excellent power and strength training program?
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:58.780]   - Okay, let me hit you with these rapid fire
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:01.060]   and then you can maybe come ask questions along that.
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.580]   Remember those modifiable variables, okay?
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:04.940]   So let's go through them in order
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:06.240]   and then what they mean specifically
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:07.220]   for power versus strength.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.700]   So modifiable variable number one is called choice.
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:13.220]   So which exercises do I select for strength?
[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:16.420]   In general for power or speed or strength,
[02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:18.460]   we wanna select compound movements.
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:21.580]   You don't often see people doing maximum strength work
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:23.480]   for like a tricep kickback, right?
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:25.820]   It's typically multiple joint movements
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:29.140]   and typically complex movements.
[02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:32.020]   In selecting these compound movements,
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:34.740]   we generally wanna actually think about exercise selection
[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.160]   of movements rather than muscle groups.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:38.300]   So this is an important distinction
[02:14:38.300 --> 02:14:39.620]   because we'll see this as a different answer
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:40.440]   when we get to hypertrophy.
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.820]   What I mean by that is when we think about,
[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:43.960]   again, strength training,
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.660]   we tend to think about bodybuilding concepts.
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.740]   We go to the gym and we do things like,
[02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:49.660]   I gotta make sure I get my chest today
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.900]   and I gotta make sure I get my hamstrings.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:54.060]   Now you're selecting exercises based on a muscle
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:54.900]   you wanna work.
[02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:56.780]   For strength development and power,
[02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:58.800]   we wanna think about movements
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.040]   rather than individual muscle groups.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.180]   So there should be things like,
[02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:04.960]   I need to train explosive hip extension,
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:08.340]   which is like a vertical jump or something like that.
[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:11.720]   I wanna train pushing or pulling movements
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:13.920]   or I wanna train rotation,
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:15.440]   which is a whole area we haven't gotten into,
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:18.220]   which is very important for overall health
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:19.220]   and wellness and longevity.
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:22.380]   So we wanna select big movements by the muscle,
[02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.380]   the movement patterns that we wanna introduce.
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:29.100]   And we just wanna select a reasonable balance between these.
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.340]   I don't care what the exact ratio is.
[02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:34.220]   You just don't wanna go an entire six months
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:36.780]   without doing anything in this rotational area
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:41.060]   or an entire eight to 10 weeks without doing something
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:44.740]   that's a lower body hinge.
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:46.420]   So any number of examples there.
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:48.440]   So just think about the rough movement patterns,
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.980]   upper and lower, push and pull,
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:52.620]   and then some sort of rotation.
[02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:53.740]   That puts you in a pretty good spot.
[02:15:53.740 --> 02:15:56.300]   If you're using three by five method
[02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:58.540]   and you're going to pick as little as three exercises,
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:00.160]   just pick one from each one of those groups.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.020]   Pick a rotation, pick a push and pick a pull.
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:06.620]   - I can easily think of a push and a pull.
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:10.300]   So for example, bench press or shoulder press,
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:14.780]   row or chin for pull and then squat or deadlift for hinge.
[02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:17.040]   What would be a good example
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:19.300]   of a quality rotational movement?
[02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:22.900]   - Yep, so anytime you can use a cable machine,
[02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:24.600]   like at the gym and you can do,
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.140]   it's kind of hard to describe this exercise,
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:29.340]   but basically you're gonna stand facing the cable
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.740]   and you're going to pull it towards yourself
[02:16:30.740 --> 02:16:31.920]   and then rotate like you're pivoting,
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.900]   like you're either swinging a golf club
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:35.900]   or hitting a baseball bat.
[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:38.740]   So you're facing one direction, I'm facing you right now,
[02:16:38.740 --> 02:16:40.280]   I'm pulling the cable towards myself
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.060]   and then I'm gonna spin, do a 180 degree pivot
[02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:45.540]   and face exactly away from you when I finish
[02:16:45.540 --> 02:16:47.720]   and then return it back in that same spot.
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:48.740]   So that's a rotation.
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:51.140]   - Great, we will provide a link to an example of that
[02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:53.060]   that you consider a quality example.
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:56.580]   - A medicine ball throw, any number of things like this
[02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:59.540]   are great rotational exercise, all right?
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:02.120]   So we select our exercises based on that.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:04.340]   We generally then, because of that as a case,
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:08.020]   we don't worry about things like eccentric versus concentric
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:09.100]   because you're generally doing
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:12.040]   a whole body athletic movement, right?
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:13.740]   Which the eccentric concentric portion
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:15.740]   is going to be folded into that
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.300]   and you really can't separate them out, all right?
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.380]   So that's exercise choice, our first variable.
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:22.380]   The next one is exercise order.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:26.160]   So because that everything driving power and strength
[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.980]   is quality based, you wanna do these
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:30.540]   at the beginning of your workout.
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:34.260]   You would not want to do anything fatiguing before this.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.500]   So no cardiovascular training,
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:39.100]   no other repetition to failure stuff.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:42.240]   If you do those before and now you're slower,
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.620]   all you've done is practice getting slower.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.580]   And so these need to be done when you're fresh.
[02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:48.620]   You also need to do them when you're very fresh
[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:50.620]   because they are the most neurologically demanding.
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:51.460]   They're complicated.
[02:17:51.460 --> 02:17:52.740]   They tend to have multiple steps
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:17:54.380]   and they're often in multiple planes
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:56.220]   and coordination is a difficult thing.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:58.780]   And if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed,
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:00.740]   your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh.
[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:01.980]   And so any amount of fatigue here
[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:04.860]   is only going to compromise the results.
[02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:07.580]   To kind of recap that, one of the major mistakes
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:09.820]   when training for strength and especially power
[02:18:09.820 --> 02:18:11.980]   is people worry way too much about fatigue.
[02:18:11.980 --> 02:18:13.780]   Those things should not be part of the equation.
[02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.480]   And in fact, if they are, that's a very good sign
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:18.180]   you're not doing this correctly, right?
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:22.140]   These are non fatiguing movements, especially speed and power.
[02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:24.420]   So choice, order is next.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:26.940]   The next one after that is volume.
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:29.460]   And we sort of hit volume and intensity,
[02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:31.260]   which is the other one.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:32.860]   We talked about that.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:35.580]   The volume is basically identical
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:38.100]   between power and strength.
[02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:39.820]   The general number we're going to look at here
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:42.420]   is something like three to 20 sets.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:43.660]   - Total per workout.
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:45.160]   - Per workout.
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.500]   But that would be like 20 would be
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:49.140]   a little bit of a special case.
[02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:51.320]   Three to five is what I told you earlier, right?
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.380]   I'm just saying like sometimes
[02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:54.680]   you can actually go quite higher in these cases,
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:57.140]   but that's the general range.
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:00.420]   - And once somebody finishes the three by five workout
[02:19:00.420 --> 02:19:02.820]   for power or strength,
[02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:04.580]   if they decide they want to throw in
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:08.260]   some calf raises and curls and forearm work
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:10.900]   or a little bit of a jogging on the treadmill or something,
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:12.040]   that's okay?
[02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:12.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:17.000]   There is very little risk of interference
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.900]   for things like speed and power.
[02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:22.360]   Strength, you have a little bit of a risk only
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.040]   because now you're introducing fatigue,
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:26.400]   which if you're really pushing strength,
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.220]   that might compromise your recovery.
[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.660]   - I could imagine doing the three to five routine
[02:19:30.660 --> 02:19:32.140]   for strength or for power,
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:35.540]   and then somebody finishing up with 10 or 15 minutes
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:37.140]   of hypertrophy arm work,
[02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:40.100]   and then being very seriously compromised
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:42.180]   if they try and come in the next day or even the next day.
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:43.020]   - Correct.
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:46.180]   - And do those big compound movements for speed and power.
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:47.020]   - That's right.
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:48.140]   - Not just because they're sore,
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.880]   but the muscles may actually still be damaged.
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.320]   And I know later we're going to talk about
[02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.660]   the somewhat tenuous relationship
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.260]   between soreness and recovery.
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:57.380]   - Yeah. Yep.
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:01.400]   So that's a really nice heuristic to pay attention to is,
[02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.800]   you can, but just be careful.
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:06.080]   Energy starts to matter at that point.
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.300]   If you're really truly trying to maximize strength,
[02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:11.940]   you would do nothing at all outside of that training.
[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:13.680]   If you're just like,
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:15.680]   I kind of want to get stronger and some other things,
[02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:17.420]   and you're willing to lose strength,
[02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:19.780]   you know, 5% of your strength gains,
[02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:21.320]   then you're totally fine.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.200]   The same can be said, by the way, for supersetting.
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:26.740]   So supersetting is an idea that says like, wait a minute,
[02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:28.020]   you're telling me, dude,
[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:31.780]   I got to take five minutes in between each set.
[02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:33.340]   - Well, that's not so much a problem nowadays
[02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:35.260]   with phone, with smartphones,
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:39.020]   because people are filling their intercept intervals
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:40.900]   with social media and texting.
[02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:41.820]   - Correct.
[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:43.620]   You don't really have to go that long.
[02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.420]   In fact, there was actually a study that came out
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:46.900]   in the last month that showed, you know,
[02:20:46.900 --> 02:20:49.180]   like really two minutes is probably sufficient
[02:20:49.180 --> 02:20:50.340]   for most people.
[02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:51.180]   Having said that,
[02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:54.260]   if you really are trying to push maximum strength adaptations
[02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:56.560]   like three to five is very, very reasonable.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.000]   Those training sessions are long,
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.840]   because you have to take,
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:03.020]   you're spending more time not doing anything
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:04.020]   than you are doing something,
[02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:05.820]   but you're trying to maximize quality.
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:07.800]   So that's just sort of like part and parcel.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:09.440]   If you're not super worried about it,
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:10.660]   you can actually do supersetting,
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:12.100]   which is, let's imagine again,
[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:14.420]   you're going to do some lunges,
[02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.940]   and while your legs are resting,
[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:17.220]   doing their three to five minutes,
[02:21:17.220 --> 02:21:21.200]   you can go over and do an upper body row or pull.
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:22.220]   And when your upper body's resting,
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:23.140]   you're going back to legs.
[02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:25.500]   So that really cuts your time in half.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.340]   Is it ideal?
[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:30.100]   No, we actually ran a study maybe 10 years ago in our lab,
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:31.660]   and we looked at that specifically,
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:33.820]   and we did see a reduction in strength performance
[02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:34.820]   in the supersetting group,
[02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:37.420]   relative to the group who did not superset.
[02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:38.660]   The question then it becomes like,
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.060]   is it enough for you to care?
[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.260]   So if you were to, if I were to say,
[02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:44.240]   "Hey, I can cut an hour off of your workout time,
[02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.340]   but you will lose 5% of your strength gain,"
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:49.400]   almost everyone would take that exchange.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.240]   With the exception of people
[02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:52.100]   who are getting close to competition,
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:55.180]   or really trying to set a new lifetime PR or something,
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:57.820]   then you might say, "No, I don't want any interference there.
[02:21:57.820 --> 02:22:00.000]   That last little margin is what I care about.
[02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.620]   Give me the extra rest."
[02:22:01.620 --> 02:22:02.460]   Great.
[02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:04.380]   So it's not a, does it work, does it not work?
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:08.020]   It's always a, what are you willing to give up versus get.
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:09.780]   - The practicalities of supersetting
[02:22:09.780 --> 02:22:12.320]   are staggering, push-pull, push-pull,
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:15.320]   in my mind are real because you have to take over
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.960]   large segments of the gym,
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:19.000]   which oftentimes leads to a situation
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.920]   where your rest times are too long or highly variable
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:24.180]   because people are working in.
[02:22:24.180 --> 02:22:25.180]   - Or you can't finish your set
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:26.740]   'cause now someone jumped into the machine.
[02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:27.580]   - Right. - Totally screws.
[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:29.820]   - Right, you lose three to five of your friends
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:31.220]   because it's obnoxious
[02:22:31.220 --> 02:22:32.700]   when you're taking over all the equipment.
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:35.620]   But in all seriousness, I think it's wonderful
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:38.260]   if you have the space and the format to do it.
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:41.160]   But at least in my experience and observation,
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:43.140]   these people know who they are.
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:46.060]   It's not practical to do on a regular basis
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:48.120]   if you train in an open commercial gym.
[02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:49.420]   - Yeah, tough to pull off.
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:54.420]   So we've covered choice, order, volume,
[02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:57.060]   and intensity to a sufficient level.
[02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:58.580]   The last one is frequency.
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:00.640]   And we've already sort of indirectly talked about that.
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.500]   Where frequency can be as high as you'd like in this area,
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:04.820]   it really depends on your recovery.
[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:07.500]   If you're really truly pushing maximum strength,
[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:10.540]   you probably do need a few days to recover,
[02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:11.740]   although that's dependent upon you.
[02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:13.780]   But speed and power can be done multiple times a day,
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:15.440]   almost every day, basically.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.900]   The one exception would be maximum sprinting speed.
[02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:21.720]   You need to be careful there for things like hamstring
[02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:23.240]   and injury, especially if you're pretty fast.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:25.200]   So you wanna be a little bit cautious of that.
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.420]   But if you're doing easier movements,
[02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:29.860]   like medicine ball throws or kettlebell swings or something,
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:31.000]   you could do those quite often
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.620]   as long as the volume is staying pretty low.
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:36.560]   Last little piece here is progression.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:38.520]   How do I progress over time?
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:39.400]   So I mentioned this earlier,
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:41.020]   but just wanna fill this gap right back in
[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:42.180]   before we head over to hypertrophy,
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:45.240]   which is three to 5% increase per week
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:47.760]   of intensity in general.
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:50.100]   And you can do upwards of about 5% increase
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.600]   in volume per week over time.
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.420]   And I generally recommend running that
[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:56.620]   for at longest eight weeks.
[02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:58.160]   But probably most realistically,
[02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:00.720]   you wanna go about five weeks or so,
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:03.880]   and then have some sort of a deload or back off week.
[02:24:03.880 --> 02:24:05.820]   If you do that, you're generally gonna be
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:07.340]   a pretty good spot.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:09.100]   So those are like the core concepts.
[02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:12.640]   Now, there's a whole bunch of fun methods
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:15.100]   you can play with within all these categories.
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.320]   And I would like to actually cover just a couple of them
[02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:20.080]   if we've got a little more space for that.
[02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:22.520]   - Sure, I'd love to hear about those.
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:25.080]   I'd like to also just queue up one,
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:28.280]   which is while I joked about people texting
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:31.000]   and doing social media between sets, and I--
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:31.960]   - That's not a joke.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:35.720]   - Well, I confess, I stopped bringing my phone into the gym
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:40.180]   because of the urge to take my mind off of the workout,
[02:24:40.180 --> 02:24:42.620]   and I just started enjoying my workouts a lot more.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:45.460]   And the workouts go far better that way.
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:46.980]   And they're just much more efficient.
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:48.780]   For me, I realize that some people,
[02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.340]   their careers take place in the gym,
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:53.380]   and so I don't look down upon anyone
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:54.460]   using their phone at the gym.
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:57.340]   But that really tends to help me.
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:25:01.720]   But I do wonder whether or not there's an optimal behavior
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:03.640]   or mindset in between sets.
[02:25:04.740 --> 02:25:06.780]   I've heard before that pacing around
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:09.580]   can actually help diffuse some of the lactate
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:14.100]   and other metabolic byproducts of work and exertion
[02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:16.000]   that can lead to better performance.
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.400]   I've also heard that shaking the muscles out.
[02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:22.740]   I mean, there's all sorts of gym lore about this,
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.620]   but maybe there's also some decent science.
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:28.880]   I'm just curious if you have any specific recommendations
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:30.540]   that people could play with or try.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:32.820]   - Yep, so for speed and power,
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:39.060]   you want to walk this balance of stiff but fresh.
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:41.100]   And so if you were to literally finish a repetition,
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:42.680]   sit on a bench for five minutes,
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:44.980]   you would stand up after that fairly stiff,
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:46.200]   and you wouldn't feel so smooth.
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:48.880]   This is all non-science.
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:51.640]   This is all practical application, right?
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:52.580]   - Anic data.
[02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:54.140]   - Anic data, there you go.
[02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:55.340]   Strength is a little bit different,
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:56.320]   but it's the same concept.
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:58.060]   You're walking that line.
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:59.760]   In general, a lot of the times,
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:01.980]   if you see powerlifters and weightlifters in between sets,
[02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:03.720]   they're going to sit down and not move.
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:05.120]   For hypertrophy, it can be a little bit different
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:06.500]   because you're getting towards fatigue.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:09.100]   And so the factors you mentioned, like clearing lactate,
[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:12.460]   well, first of all, lactate is not actually causing fatigue.
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.020]   That's a giant myth that we'll--
[02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:17.160]   - Which is why I teed it up, no, I'm just kidding.
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:18.340]   - But in the case of, again, speed and power,
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:19.180]   you're not going to fatigue,
[02:26:19.180 --> 02:26:20.820]   so fatigue management's not really an issue.
[02:26:20.820 --> 02:26:21.980]   You want to make sure that you're getting
[02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:23.540]   complete neurological recovery,
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:25.820]   which is a little bit slower than muscle.
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.380]   Energetically, you're not out of any gas whatsoever, right?
[02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:31.660]   You are not in a lack of fuel,
[02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:34.140]   you're doing three repetitions of a vertical jump.
[02:26:34.140 --> 02:26:35.960]   No clothes. - Plenty of glycogen.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:36.880]   - Totally.
[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:38.740]   - What about stretching between sets?
[02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:41.060]   - Yeah, you probably don't want to do that either.
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:44.920]   There are very clear examples of pre-exercise stretching,
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.120]   static stretching, being quite detrimental
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.480]   for maximum power production.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:50.460]   The same thing for speed and strength.
[02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:52.180]   And that's been shown actually a number of times
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:53.280]   in a number of laboratories,
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:57.660]   which is like a classic hallmark any scientist looks for,
[02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:59.740]   like really jumping on board with an idea.
[02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:01.320]   If it's shown not only multiple times,
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:03.440]   but in multiple laboratories for multiple scientists,
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.200]   and they're all seeing the same thing,
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:06.560]   you start to get a lot of confidence
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:07.420]   that that's a real finding.
[02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:08.560]   And that's been shown,
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:10.900]   we've done that in our Center for Sport Performance,
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.440]   not myself, but one of my colleagues
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:13.580]   has done a lot of stretching research,
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:14.760]   and he's seen that a lot.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:16.740]   On everything from vertical jump
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:20.000]   to isokinetic dynamometers and force velocity curves.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.140]   And there's, we've seen this in sprinting,
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:24.120]   we've seen this in speed, we've seen this in loaded stuff.
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:27.000]   So you don't want to spend a ton of time stretching,
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.520]   statically stretching a muscle prior to it.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.900]   If you do that, and you have to do that, say for example,
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.920]   you finish that, you're just like feeling really tight.
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:34.800]   Yeah, go ahead.
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:36.480]   Like you need to get in the right position,
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:38.320]   especially for most people where,
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.820]   are you willing to sacrifice 10% of power
[02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.040]   to make sure you don't get hurt?
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:44.820]   Yes, that answer is almost always yes,
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:47.080]   outside of some very specific athlete scenarios.
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:49.720]   So if you're not in the right position,
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.360]   I actually remember having this conversation with Kelly,
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:53.960]   Kelly started a long time ago, it was just like,
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.920]   yeah, fine, I'll lose 5%.
[02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:57.640]   That means I'm not gonna get in a bad position
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:27:59.440]   and hurt my back.
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:00.840]   And I totally, totally agree.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.360]   So if you gotta open up a hip or an ankle or something
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:06.040]   to get there, get in the right position, number one.
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:08.040]   We'll live with the 5% reduction in power.
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:10.660]   And if you do, just reactivate.
[02:28:10.660 --> 02:28:11.920]   So before you go do your working set,
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:13.840]   go do something fast again, a vertical jump,
[02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:15.400]   a short sprint, an acceleration,
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.760]   and sort of get that system cleared back up.
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:21.000]   If you didn't stretch it for long enough,
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.260]   and you didn't hold it for long enough,
[02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:24.300]   you should be able to be just fine.
[02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:27.120]   So when it comes to hypertrophy,
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:28.720]   you can really stretch what you want.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:31.240]   'Cause it's not driven by intensity or outcome,
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:33.680]   it's being driven by an insult into the tissue.
[02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:35.400]   And so if you're pre-fatigued for hypertrophy,
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:36.440]   it doesn't matter.
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.460]   If you're pre-stretched, that doesn't matter.
[02:28:38.460 --> 02:28:40.280]   We're not going for quality of outcome,
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:42.800]   we're going for quality of internal signal,
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:45.640]   which is not gonna be changed by your force output.
[02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:47.000]   So it doesn't really matter.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.520]   - You mentioned a few other things
[02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:52.880]   that one might consider in light of the list
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:55.740]   that you provided of choice, order, volume,
[02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:57.560]   frequency, and progression.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:59.560]   - Right, so starting off with power,
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:02.420]   I just wanted to hand the listeners here
[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:04.700]   with a whole bunch of different methods to go play with.
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.760]   So as long as you hit those concepts,
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:08.420]   the repetition range for power,
[02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:11.080]   30 to 70% of your one repetition max,
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:13.700]   depending on the exercise and your training status,
[02:29:13.700 --> 02:29:16.000]   you're gonna get power.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.320]   As long as you're attempting to go fast,
[02:29:17.320 --> 02:29:18.160]   it's gonna be great.
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:19.480]   A lot of things you can try.
[02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:23.100]   Plyometrics are a great example
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:26.800]   of things that are effective for power development.
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:30.400]   We've mentioned medicine ball throws, short sprints.
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:33.600]   You can even do sprints on like an air bike,
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:35.960]   which is a great, super safe activity.
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:37.620]   You can do them from like a rolling start
[02:29:37.620 --> 02:29:39.420]   where you kind of like get going a little bit
[02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:41.160]   and then you explode for five seconds
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:43.760]   to see how fast you can get, or a dead start.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:46.640]   Like both of those are very, very acceptable.
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:48.820]   Weightlifting movements, so snatches and cleaning jerks,
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:50.480]   are tremendously effective.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:52.280]   In fact, they are pound for pound,
[02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:55.200]   by far the most effective exercise choice
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:57.480]   for power development, like without question.
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:58.580]   So those are good ones.
[02:29:58.580 --> 02:30:00.720]   Clapping pushups, speed squats.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:02.620]   These are a whole host of different things
[02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:05.240]   that you can do for speed and power development.
[02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:08.600]   Depending on your kettlebell swings, another great one.
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:11.360]   All these can be done depending on your preference,
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:14.620]   exercise availability, what's at your gym or not gym,
[02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:16.200]   any of those things.
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:18.360]   - If somebody is more focused on strength
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.200]   as opposed to power,
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:22.520]   what are the additional variables they should consider?
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:26.000]   Again, within the context of this overarching theme
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.800]   of choice, order, volume, frequency, and progression.
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:30.640]   - Absolutely.
[02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:33.320]   It's almost identical with a couple of small exceptions.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:37.640]   Number one, you probably can't do as many working sets
[02:30:37.640 --> 02:30:38.840]   per week for strength
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:40.880]   because now you're introducing a heavier load
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:43.340]   and that's gonna represent some sort of fatigue.
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:46.380]   Load on the tissue, all those things.
[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:50.600]   So you could probably get away with doing 20 sets of two
[02:30:50.600 --> 02:30:53.760]   of a vertical jump four or five times a week.
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:57.200]   You probably couldn't do that at a 90% on squat, right?
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:30:58.600]   So the total amount of sets
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:00.580]   and the total amount of weekly load you can get to
[02:31:00.580 --> 02:31:01.680]   just needs to be lower.
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:02.760]   And then the intensity, right?
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:04.600]   So we talked about that needs to be generally higher
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:08.680]   than 70% with some portion of that being working sets
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:12.000]   and some portion of that really truly being at 90% plus.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.460]   Everything else is pretty identical.
[02:31:14.460 --> 02:31:16.800]   You still wanna emphasize maximum speed,
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:19.280]   despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:20.620]   because you've introduced load.
[02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:22.000]   You still need to be attempting that,
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.480]   but you're gonna be picking complex exercises.
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:27.680]   You're generally going to be hedging more towards
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:29.160]   marbles and machines.
[02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:32.680]   So this is a case where body weight training
[02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:36.180]   can be effective again, particularly for the upper body.
[02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:37.240]   But at some point,
[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.000]   you're really gonna have to move past that
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.900]   because there's just a certain amount of load
[02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:44.080]   you can't put on the lower body with just your body weight.
[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:46.920]   You get limited by how much you weigh or,
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:48.120]   I mean, there's a couple of things you can do,
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:50.960]   but you're gonna run out past that pretty quickly.
[02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:53.040]   And so when it comes to strength,
[02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:55.540]   they tend to be less athletic movements
[02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:58.160]   because we have to have a barbell on us.
[02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:01.320]   We have to be on a machine or something like that.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:04.200]   And so that's a subtle difference in exercise choice.
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:06.920]   We need to also be careful about the eccentric portion
[02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:09.420]   and things like that where we don't have as much risk
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:11.020]   in like a speed or power line.
[02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:14.220]   So some of the different things you can play with there,
[02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:16.280]   we've talked about doing things like pushes and pulls.
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:18.200]   I also love carries.
[02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:22.160]   So a farmer's carry, pushing a sled, dragging a sled,
[02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:23.940]   all kinds of things, a yoke lock,
[02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.320]   all kinds of carry modalities
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:29.160]   that are very, very effective for strength.
[02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.920]   There's eccentric overload training,
[02:32:31.920 --> 02:32:33.040]   which we really haven't gotten into,
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:34.260]   but it's a really advanced technique
[02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:37.960]   where you can actually load at greater than 100%
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.580]   of your one repetition max,
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:42.320]   but you're only going to do the eccentric portion of it.
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:44.640]   So physiologically, you are much stronger eccentrically
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:46.280]   than you are concentrically
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:49.600]   for a variety of muscle tissue reasons, actually.
[02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:53.000]   And so imagine if you can do a bench press at 200 pounds
[02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.560]   and what you might actually do is load it to 220
[02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:56.800]   and you would have a spotter
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.280]   and maybe even use it in a rack
[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:00.120]   and you would lower it down under control
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:02.840]   all the way to the bottom and then stop.
[02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:04.920]   Your friends would lift it back up at the top
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:06.920]   and then you would just practice that eccentric portion.
[02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:09.040]   You would actually be able to lower, say 220 pounds
[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:10.920]   effectively, despite the fact that you wouldn't
[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:12.800]   have been able to lift it back up.
[02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:13.880]   You don't need to start there,
[02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:16.880]   but that is a very effective method for increasing.
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:20.280]   In fact, one of my doctoral students right now
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:22.560]   is doing a project on this at USC
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:25.720]   and he's focusing directly on this
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:29.200]   and it's quite clear that's oftentimes more effective
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.440]   at strength development than anything else
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:33.080]   'cause you can actually, just like in the speed example,
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:35.280]   where you want to actually practice moving faster.
[02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.160]   So instead of practicing at 100% of your one
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.640]   or max for strength, you actually practice
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:41.640]   at higher than that to get better at it.
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:44.700]   So that's another much more advanced tool.
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:48.160]   Please don't let me get sued by saying all that.
[02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.600]   Like folks, be careful, make sure you're doing
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:52.240]   the proper exercise in your positioning
[02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:55.480]   and in like caveat, caveat, caveat, okay.
[02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:59.000]   But outside of that, it can be, it's totally fine and safe.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.160]   - Yeah, when people get injured, they can't train,
[02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:04.280]   can't train, you don't progress, you lose progress.
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:06.560]   So certainly that's worth highlighting.
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.040]   - So two more, little more advanced techniques
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:10.040]   that I want to throw out there.
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:12.360]   And one of them is called cluster sets.
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.500]   So cluster sets are, there's a bunch of ways to do it,
[02:34:14.500 --> 02:34:16.580]   but imagine taking a mini break
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:18.920]   in between every single repetition.
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:22.000]   So say you're gonna do five repetitions in a row.
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.600]   What you're actually gonna do is do one repetition,
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:28.320]   set it down, pause for five to 10 seconds,
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.360]   and then do the next one.
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.480]   Pause, do the next one, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause.
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:35.600]   So you can imagine doing like a squat
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.360]   and you're gonna go down, explode up,
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:39.360]   you're gonna stand there, you're gonna rack it out.
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:42.520]   You're gonna kind of like shake back out, catch your breath,
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.360]   walk back in, do another one, rack it out.
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:47.860]   And you're gonna repeat that until you've executed
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:49.920]   your three or four or five repetitions.
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:52.400]   And then you take your three to five minute break
[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:53.960]   before your next set.
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:56.960]   That is an incredibly effective way for both strength,
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:59.160]   power, and actually even hypertrophy.
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:02.300]   Because you can keep the quality, the force output,
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:04.640]   the power output very, very, very high.
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:06.600]   'Cause you're getting these little mini breaks
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:08.100]   and you're not getting fatigued setting in
[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:10.000]   by the time you get your, say, third or fourth
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.280]   or fifth repetition in that set.
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.820]   After repetition one, you start to see very small,
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:18.720]   subtle reductions in power output
[02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:20.700]   because you start to see a little bit of fatigue.
[02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:22.820]   You take those five to 10 seconds off,
[02:35:22.820 --> 02:35:25.400]   even up to 20 seconds you can actually do it.
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:27.480]   You don't see any drop in force output
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:28.380]   over the course of the five.
[02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:30.980]   And so what you really have done is you've gotten five,
[02:35:30.980 --> 02:35:34.260]   in this example, first repetitions.
[02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:35.680]   Which is the way that we would kind of say it, right?
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:39.040]   So all five of those had the same quality as rep number one,
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:41.020]   which is, again, as we're talking,
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:42.820]   that's the driver in strength.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:44.080]   And so that's the one we want to preserve.
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:46.280]   So it takes a little bit longer.
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:50.100]   For some exercises it's not very good.
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:51.640]   It's great for like a deadlift.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.760]   'Cause you set it back down, shake it back out, regroup.
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:55.180]   Hard to do with the bench.
[02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:57.560]   You got to re-rack it back in, then re-rack it back out.
[02:35:57.560 --> 02:35:59.500]   It's like kind of a pain in the ass.
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:01.360]   So there's some exercises it doesn't work well with
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:02.280]   and some that it does.
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:06.160]   But cluster sets, and a lot of research on those.
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.600]   Very effective.
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:10.520]   - Would you recommend if somebody is doing cluster sets
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:13.060]   that they do them for every session within that week,
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:15.000]   or just this is an occasional thing?
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.080]   - You could do it.
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.720]   This could be your training strategy.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:18.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:20.600]   So you can really take it that serious.
[02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:23.080]   In fact, like if you look at, again, the weightlifters,
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:25.080]   they will do cluster sets by default.
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:25.920]   Not even trying.
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:27.400]   So say they'll do like a clean,
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:28.600]   and then they'll drop the weight back out.
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:30.480]   They're supposed to be doing, say, a set of three.
[02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:32.280]   But almost always, they're gonna like shake it out,
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:33.360]   re-grip, and then pull it again.
[02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:35.840]   And sometimes their set of three takes like a minute.
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:36.960]   And then it's like, you hear it's funny,
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:39.560]   'cause it's like I set a triple PR.
[02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:41.960]   You're like, no, you did three singles.
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:43.520]   Like what's the difference between doing three singles
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:46.760]   and a set of three when you took a minute between each rep?
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:47.600]   I love that community.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:50.040]   So yeah, I mean, it could be your strategy.
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.640]   It could be like, hey, for this five-week block,
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:53.640]   this is all my training.
[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:55.260]   Especially for your compound movements.
[02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:56.280]   If you're gonna go to start doing
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.540]   some of the smaller movements, maybe you give up on that.
[02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:00.780]   It could also just be something you do
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:03.600]   for your one primary exercise for the day.
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:05.680]   So do that thing that is the most important first,
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:06.580]   and just do it for that one.
[02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:07.960]   And then the rest of them, you can kind of ditch it
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:10.680]   if you need to save a little bit of that time.
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:12.960]   It can also be something you do by feel.
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:15.080]   So you're two reps in, and you go,
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.500]   guy, like I'm not feeling like Poppy here.
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:18.760]   Like re-rack it, catch my breath for a quick second,
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:19.600]   and do it.
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:21.320]   So it doesn't have to be ultra-planned.
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:25.120]   I guess what I'm doing is I'm giving you an excuse
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.600]   to make sure you're super fresh for every rep.
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:28.760]   It matters.
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:31.100]   The last one I wanna talk about here
[02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:34.420]   is what's called dynamic variable resistance.
[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:35.940]   So dynamic variable resistance
[02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:39.420]   is fixing the problem we have
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:41.600]   with what's called the human strength curve.
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.820]   So theory of constraints, again.
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:46.260]   You're only as strong as you are
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:47.980]   in your weakest point of the movement.
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:49.640]   So depending on the movement you do,
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.840]   this happens at a different range of motion.
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:54.720]   Well, the deadlift is easiest example.
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:57.400]   It's also because we've done research in my lab
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.280]   using this stuff on the deadlift.
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:00.960]   So I can speak to it very directly.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.220]   When you go to pull it off the ground,
[02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:04.300]   some people are gonna fail right at the bottom,
[02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:06.240]   meaning they won't get the weight off the ground at all.
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.400]   Some people will fail just below the knees.
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:11.040]   That's like kind of like the hardest transition period.
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:13.680]   And then some people will fail right at the top
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.320]   just before they can lock out.
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:16.400]   Okay, great.
[02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:19.220]   So what that means is at some point of that lift,
[02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:22.260]   you're going to only be limited
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:25.900]   by your strength in the weakest area, all right?
[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:29.100]   So if you have a constant load on the bar
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:31.780]   in those other two parts of the range of motion,
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:33.920]   where you are not the weakest,
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:36.780]   they're never truly being tested for their maximum strength
[02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:39.060]   'cause they're always being limited by the previous one.
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:41.100]   And this is the same argument that we would get into
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:44.300]   if people ask about what do we think about using straps,
[02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:47.900]   strapping your hand to a bar for deadlifts,
[02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:48.740]   things like that.
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:49.740]   There's pros and cons here.
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.580]   There are times when you wanna use a strap
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:53.420]   and there are times when it's a bad idea.
[02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:55.380]   So what dynamic variable resistance is
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:38:58.060]   is either using things like a heavy band
[02:38:58.060 --> 02:39:01.380]   or chains on the bar, if you've ever seen people do that.
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:03.460]   So in my lab, we actually have a force plate on the ground
[02:39:03.460 --> 02:39:07.380]   and then we have built in basically hooks
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:08.220]   on the front and the back
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:10.860]   so we can actually set a barbell on top of the force plate
[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:11.980]   where you stand on it
[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:13.780]   and then run bands from the back to the front
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:15.700]   running over top of the weights.
[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:19.060]   And so when you stand up, as you're going up vertically,
[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.460]   the bands are getting tighter and tighter
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:22.300]   and pulling the weight towards the ground.
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:25.700]   So the weight is getting heavier and heavier as you stand up.
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:28.580]   So as you start to gain mechanical advantage
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:32.060]   in your positioning, you start to increase load
[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:34.320]   'cause the bands are getting tighter and tighter and tighter.
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.900]   So this allows you to train that full part
[02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:40.980]   of the strength curve and to challenge your stronger areas
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:44.740]   with heavier weight and your weaker areas with lower weight.
[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:46.500]   You can do the same thing with a bench press.
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:49.620]   You can do it with a squat and any other exercise variation.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:53.900]   And dynamic variable resistance is incredibly effective
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:55.320]   for a number of things.
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.060]   You're going to give up a little bit
[02:39:58.060 --> 02:40:02.680]   because the total load you can put on the barbell is lower
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:04.740]   because you're gonna be adding, in large cases,
[02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:06.980]   several hundred pounds of band tension.
[02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:11.220]   And so pros and cons, it's always a game.
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:14.100]   It changes the curve, but it's a very good technique
[02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.540]   that people, it's fairly easy to implement.
[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:20.500]   It's fun, and in fact, if you try this on a bench or a squat,
[02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:22.060]   you're gonna be, the first time you give it a go,
[02:40:22.060 --> 02:40:23.260]   you're like, "Oh my God,"
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:25.500]   'cause the bands are pulling you all over the place.
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:27.980]   So you have to get very stable very quick.
[02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:29.820]   Been shown a number of times, a handful of studies
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:30.860]   out of many laboratories
[02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:33.100]   to be a very effective training technique.
[02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:34.140]   A little bit more advanced,
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:35.940]   but I wanted to throw that in there for the folks
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:38.540]   that are maybe just tired of sort of doing the same
[02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:39.880]   barbells and dumbbells and machines,
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:41.460]   and you want to try something different,
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:42.840]   a very effective technique.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:43.780]   - Sounds like fun.
[02:40:43.780 --> 02:40:44.660]   - Yeah, it's great.
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:46.460]   - With your permission, I'm going to read back
[02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:48.580]   my summary list of training for power
[02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:51.460]   and training for strength, according to your description,
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:54.400]   and you can tell me where I'm right and where I'm wrong.
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:56.960]   I'm going to pick three to five exercises,
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:58.860]   and these should be compound exercises,
[02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:00.900]   so multi-joint movements.
[02:41:00.900 --> 02:41:03.160]   I'm going to perform those exercises
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:05.640]   for three to five repetitions each.
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:11.420]   I'm going to do three to five movements total per workout,
[02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:14.780]   and I'm going to rest three to five minutes between sets.
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:18.220]   Okay, if I'm training for power,
[02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:22.140]   the weight loads on the work sets, so not the warmup sets,
[02:41:22.140 --> 02:41:25.480]   but the work sets are going to fall somewhere in the range
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.260]   of 30 to 70% of my one repetition maximum.
[02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:31.700]   - Yep, and the larger the movement,
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:33.380]   the higher that number goes.
[02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:36.340]   So on a squat, you're okay getting 50 or 60%.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:38.820]   On a bench, you would not want to go that high.
[02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:41.080]   You would want to stay close to that 30 to 40% range.
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:42.660]   So the way you scale that up and down
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:45.660]   is dependent upon the difficulty of the movement.
[02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:47.300]   - Great.
[02:41:47.300 --> 02:41:49.060]   If training for strength,
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:54.060]   I'm going to have my work sets be 70% or more
[02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.940]   of my one repetition maximum.
[02:41:56.940 --> 02:41:59.760]   - Yep, and the only thing to add there is,
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:01.580]   in the case of actually all of them,
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:05.220]   it's okay to go less than three reps per set.
[02:42:05.220 --> 02:42:08.420]   So a single or a double, one or two reps per set,
[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:09.480]   is also fantastic.
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:12.940]   So we use three to five as the concept, but less is okay.
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:15.820]   Going more than that is generally not a good idea.
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:18.520]   So less is okay, more is generally not.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:20.280]   - Okay, and then you listed off a number
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:23.540]   of really valuable, I don't even want to call them
[02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:26.500]   fine points, but important points to keep in mind
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:29.540]   within each and both of these programs.
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:33.060]   One that really stands out in my mind is this idea
[02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:37.000]   of if I perform this three by five program,
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.740]   but I'm also including some hypertrophy work
[02:42:39.740 --> 02:42:42.580]   for arms or calves or muscle groups
[02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:46.820]   that might not be hit as directly as one might like
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:48.820]   during the three by five component.
[02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:52.180]   That's okay, but do that after the three by five training.
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:55.820]   And keep in mind that that additional work
[02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:59.020]   can potentially compromise recovery for the three by five
[02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:01.740]   power promoting or strength promoting program.
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:06.420]   The example being, for instance, if one does arm work
[02:43:06.420 --> 02:43:08.420]   on the first workout of the week,
[02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:10.600]   or even the third workout of the week,
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:12.580]   or the fifth workout of the week,
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:14.260]   and that arm work is higher repetition,
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:17.880]   hypertrophy directed work, it's reasonable to assume
[02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:21.080]   that it might impede some of the three by five
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:23.180]   power promoting or strength promoting training
[02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:24.380]   in the subsequent workout.
[02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:26.160]   So just to be mindful of that,
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:28.740]   and perhaps throttle back on the intensity or the volume,
[02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:33.740]   or if my goal is strictly power or strictly strength,
[02:43:33.740 --> 02:43:36.820]   probably best to leave out other forms of training.
[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:38.620]   - Yep, love it.
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:41.820]   One last little thing I don't think we did justice
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:43.440]   is intention.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:46.920]   And the reason I wanna go back to this now is because
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:50.600]   we've talked a lot about specific loads you have to hit.
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:52.260]   And that's generally the case.
[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:55.920]   But if intention is there, you can fudge those numbers
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.620]   in terms of how much load goes on the bar.
[02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:00.640]   In fact, you can get as low as no load on the bar.
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:03.360]   A great example here is like a plank exercise.
[02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:05.280]   So you can do a plank in which you get in a position
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:09.440]   and you simply contract the least amount necessary
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.540]   to hold the position.
[02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:15.020]   Also, you could contract as hard as possible,
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:17.960]   pulling your scapula down and back, squeezing your core,
[02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:20.480]   squeezing your quads, squeezing your glutes.
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:22.880]   That is actually going to still help strength production
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:25.760]   because you're attempting to contract very, very hard,
[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:28.640]   even though quote unquote, the load is the same.
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.480]   That thing extends to weight on the bar.
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:36.280]   So you could theoretically see large improvements in strength
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:38.880]   at 50% of your one at max,
[02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:42.000]   if you're contracting as hard as possible.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.720]   And so there's a lots, lots and lots of different ways
[02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:47.800]   you can train for strength that are outside
[02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:51.040]   of this weight lifting, weight training spectrum.
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:53.840]   And if you hear things like this and you're like,
[02:44:53.840 --> 02:44:57.580]   wow, I know I read this book or I saw this other coach
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:00.160]   who, you know, was like, I got so much stronger that way.
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:03.780]   Well, if intention is there, those are absolutely possible.
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:07.320]   This could be anything from body weight style of training.
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:09.880]   It could be very low load implement stuff.
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:12.680]   So a kettlebell, a light kettlebell or a ball,
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:14.040]   it could be single leg training.
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.240]   It's like all kinds of different methods.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:19.160]   They will only work for strength though,
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:22.520]   when you're past your first handful of months of training,
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:23.800]   if intention is there.
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.040]   And if it is, then these specific numbers and protocols
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:27.920]   don't matter as much.
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:30.300]   So don't get too caught up in them
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:33.200]   if you're not worrying about exercise quality.
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:35.320]   And this is very, very important because
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:38.360]   you mentioned earlier about how you stop taking your phone
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:39.740]   into the gym with you.
[02:45:39.740 --> 02:45:42.600]   One of our former students, Ramsey Ninjem,
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:44.360]   is the head strength conditioning coach
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:45.460]   at the University of Kansas.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:47.880]   And he made a great post a couple of days ago
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:49.840]   where he gave sort of a tip of,
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:52.120]   how do I improve training quality?
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:54.880]   And one of his tips is set your playlist
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:56.360]   before you go to the gym.
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:59.360]   And the reason is people spend so much time in between sets
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:01.720]   just finding the next song that they like.
[02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:05.620]   It makes their workouts so long and so unproductive.
[02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:08.080]   So that is one strategy or do what you do,
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:09.920]   which is ditch the music entirely.
[02:46:09.920 --> 02:46:12.600]   When you don't have music or a phone to look at,
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.900]   you only have one job.
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:15.240]   You only have one thing to pay attention to.
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:18.060]   And what you'll find is the quality of the training
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:20.000]   will go up exponentially.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:21.680]   You will feel kind of quote unquote bored,
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:23.800]   but that just means you'll go back to training
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:24.680]   and you'll get a lot more done
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:26.120]   'cause you have one thing to focus on.
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:28.180]   So you can get a lot more done
[02:46:28.180 --> 02:46:29.800]   when you avoid those distractions.
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:33.440]   And when you're doing strength and especially power work,
[02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.400]   since it's not fatiguing,
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:37.600]   strength will be a little bit, but power won't be.
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:39.440]   People tend to get very bored.
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:42.920]   They're used to either feeling a pump or a burn or a sweat.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.500]   And that's their like perception of my quality of workout.
[02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:48.940]   These exercises will not hit that for you.
[02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:51.360]   So there has to be another metric you're looking at,
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.860]   which is I'm going to try to move as well as I can,
[02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:56.480]   as hard as I can.
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:57.780]   That's going to produce your results.
[02:46:57.780 --> 02:46:59.200]   If you can't do that,
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.240]   then you might as well just not do these workouts.
[02:47:01.240 --> 02:47:02.080]   Go do something else.
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:03.740]   You're just gonna be wasting time.
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:06.020]   You're gonna be burning a very low amount of calories.
[02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:07.520]   You'll have wasted an hour
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:09.360]   and you're gonna go right back to the place you were.
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:11.340]   So be very intentional.
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:14.240]   There are actually some studies showing
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:15.640]   that music can enhance performance.
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:17.340]   We've done some of these in our lab.
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:18.180]   So what's that mean?
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:19.360]   It's not about the music per se.
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:20.600]   It's about the focus and intent
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:23.120]   and do whatever it takes to be very focused and intent.
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:24.980]   And you can actually get in and out very quickly
[02:47:24.980 --> 02:47:27.860]   and get a lot of work done and see a lot of results.
[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:28.700]   - Love it.
[02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:31.620]   Okay, let's talk about hypertrophy,
[02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:35.860]   the topic that occupies the minds of so many youth,
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:38.640]   young men, but also a lot of women.
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:40.680]   I think one of the really interesting progressions
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:43.600]   that's taken place in the last decade or so
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:48.600]   is that far more men and women are using resistance training
[02:47:48.600 --> 02:47:52.160]   in order to evoke hypertrophy, growth of muscles.
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.740]   For aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons.
[02:47:55.740 --> 02:48:00.320]   What are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy?
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:02.240]   - So not to correct you or insult you,
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:04.720]   but probably a better way to think about that question
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:08.900]   is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle
[02:48:08.900 --> 02:48:10.880]   to induce hypertrophy?
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.200]   Now there are hormonal factors that are important.
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:15.360]   There are nutritional factors,
[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:18.360]   but just to stick with the context of training.
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:21.040]   This is really gonna frame a lot of our answers.
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:22.240]   And as you'll see,
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:24.920]   it's one of the reasons why I call hypertrophy training
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:27.680]   kind of idiot proof in terms of programming.
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:31.160]   Now the work is hard, difficult and all that,
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:34.740]   but the precision needed is a lot less
[02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:37.760]   than what we saw in power and strength.
[02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:38.680]   And so if you note there,
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:40.920]   like it's very important that you do it in this style
[02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:44.040]   with this intent and within these parameters.
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:45.080]   And if you're outside of the parameters,
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:46.060]   it's not gonna be it.
[02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:50.000]   Hypertrophy has a very broad range
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]   in terms of your actual applications.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.540]   And this is why you have and will continue to see
[02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:58.820]   countless styles of training that all work.
[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:02.040]   I mean, I know you were mentored earlier in life
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:04.480]   by one of my favorite people in this entire field,
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:07.040]   Mike Mentzer, like just an absolute character.
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:08.620]   His style was completely different
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:11.400]   than what you would see in a classic textbook
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.680]   or any number of different influencers
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:18.680]   or coaches or individuals.
[02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:20.200]   And if you've ever thought to yourself,
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:22.320]   like why is it all these programs work?
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:23.860]   And people love to jump to things like,
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:25.280]   well, it's the steroids.
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.840]   Like just get that out of the equation for now.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:28.680]   Independent of that,
[02:49:28.680 --> 02:49:30.200]   that's not even part of the equation,
[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:31.400]   you're still going to see results.
[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:32.880]   And the question is like, why?
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:35.160]   Well, that's because what's driving changes
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.880]   in the strength and power
[02:49:37.880 --> 02:49:42.020]   are the adaptations of specificity.
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:45.440]   What's driving changes in hypertrophy
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:46.640]   is much more well-rounded.
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:48.840]   And so you have options to get there.
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:51.020]   Remember, you're training a movement
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:54.380]   and now you're training a response
[02:49:54.380 --> 02:49:55.560]   and a muscle that cause the growth.
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:57.240]   That's very, very different.
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:00.120]   So if we look at like the classic dogma,
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:03.360]   we have to basically challenge the muscle
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:06.200]   to need to come back, in this case, specifically bigger,
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:09.400]   and the nutrients need to be there to support that growth.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:11.400]   Okay, the nutrients aside, perhaps we can come
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:13.520]   and a few more minutes and talk about that.
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.680]   So all we really have to do
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:18.440]   is going back to our dogma of activation
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:19.880]   of something on the cell wall.
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:21.100]   We've talked about this earlier.
[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:23.260]   That's got to induce that signaling cascade.
[02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:26.480]   That's got to be strong enough to cause a nucleus
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:28.880]   to react to it, to go to the ribosomes,
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:31.620]   to initiate this entire cascade of protein synthesis.
[02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:34.320]   Okay, so that signal has to be one of a couple of things.
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.120]   Either it has to be strong enough one time,
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:40.560]   it has to be frequent enough,
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:43.960]   or it has to be a combination of these things.
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:47.380]   All right, so I can get there with a lot of frequency
[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:49.260]   and a moderate signal.
[02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:52.560]   I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal,
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.920]   like more akin to what you did with Mike back in the day,
[02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:55.760]   I'm sure.
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:50:56.800]   - And still train that way.
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:50:57.640]   - Still train that way.
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:00.000]   - Each muscle group mainly once a week directly
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.480]   and once a week indirectly.
[02:51:02.480 --> 02:51:05.560]   - So all you have to do there to not fail
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:07.640]   is to make sure the training is hard enough
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:08.600]   and it's going to work.
[02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:10.400]   If you choose the frequency path,
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:11.520]   then you actually have to make sure
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:13.160]   you're not training too hard
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:15.120]   to where you can actually maintain the frequency.
[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:18.000]   The only wrong combination here is infrequent
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.880]   and low intensity and low volume.
[02:51:19.880 --> 02:51:20.720]   That's it.
[02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:23.360]   As long as one of those three variables is high,
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:24.360]   you're going to get there.
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:27.120]   Because the mechanisms that are needed to activate
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:29.040]   that signaling cascade are wide ranging.
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:31.720]   And this is why when we even see things like
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:33.820]   blood flow restriction training, right?
[02:51:33.820 --> 02:51:36.120]   This is when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:38.840]   and you block blood flow and you use no load
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:41.560]   or as low as say 30% of your maximum.
[02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:43.660]   And you take it to fatigue failure.
[02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:46.000]   That actually is an equally effective way
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.520]   of inducing hypertrophy.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:51.000]   Despite the fact that you're using three, five, 10,
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.960]   maybe most 20 to 30% of your one at max.
[02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:54.800]   Why?
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:57.920]   Because you went through the route of metabolic disturbance.
[02:51:57.920 --> 02:51:59.640]   Other ways, say a higher load,
[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:03.480]   maybe as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:06.320]   is going to get through what's called mechanical tension.
[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:08.060]   And so there's these different paths
[02:52:08.060 --> 02:52:09.000]   that we can get to the same spot.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.880]   Now, eventually these things have a saturation point.
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:14.340]   So you don't need all three of these mechanisms.
[02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:18.000]   The third one of course being muscle damage or breakdown.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.260]   And I know we want to chat a little bit about that,
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:23.380]   but none of these three are absolutely required.
[02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:26.220]   You can have multiple of them in a session.
[02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:27.880]   You don't have to have breakdown at all.
[02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:31.760]   That is a complete, well, really it's a flat out lie
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:34.980]   that you have to break a muscle down to cause it to grow.
[02:52:34.980 --> 02:52:36.520]   That's just not needed at all.
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:38.680]   You have to have one of these three things though.
[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:41.080]   And so again, this allows you a lot of flexibility,
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:44.880]   which is why crafting your program, which is best for you,
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:47.520]   is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy.
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:49.640]   You just have to make sure you do the work.
[02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:52.400]   And you want to make sure you have a few standards in place
[02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:54.600]   with the exercise choice and some other things
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:56.880]   that we'll hit in just a second.
[02:52:56.880 --> 02:52:59.640]   But that's really the fundamental way of getting to it.
[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:02.680]   Making sure either that signal is loud enough
[02:53:02.680 --> 02:53:07.040]   or frequent enough to give the nuclei
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:09.480]   a convincing enough reason to spend the resources,
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:11.560]   'cause you have to remember two things.
[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:13.720]   In order to grow new skeletal muscle,
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:16.840]   you need amino acids, which are your supply.
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:19.000]   And then you need primarily carbohydrates
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.600]   as the energy source to power that synthesis process.
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:24.320]   You remember basic chemistry that says
[02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.300]   if you're gonna take two atoms
[02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:28.920]   and you're gonna pull them apart or put them together,
[02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:29.960]   that's going to take energy.
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:32.920]   Typically, and in most of actually metabolism,
[02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:35.780]   when you split a bond, you're gonna get,
[02:53:35.780 --> 02:53:36.620]   it's called exergonic.
[02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:37.880]   You're gonna get energy from that.
[02:53:37.880 --> 02:53:39.960]   But when you put them together,
[02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:41.140]   that's going to take energy.
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:43.700]   This is why we call that protein synthesis, right?
[02:53:43.700 --> 02:53:46.940]   So you have to convince your nucleus that one,
[02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:49.960]   invest those resources in energy, primarily carbohydrate.
[02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:53.740]   But number two, and more importantly, invest that supply.
[02:53:53.740 --> 02:53:55.760]   There's a ton of possible ways to get energy,
[02:53:55.760 --> 02:53:58.180]   but there's a very low amount of amino acids available.
[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:00.040]   And you need them for many more things
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:02.020]   than just taking your biceps
[02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:04.900]   from 17 inches to 18 inches, right?
[02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:07.560]   It's not going to do that if you're in a position
[02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:09.680]   to where again, you can't sustain immune function.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:12.120]   If red blood cell turnover needs to be higher
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:13.240]   or any of the other main,
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:15.900]   like tons of things that you need proteins for.
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:18.240]   So you have to be able to say like, are you sure?
[02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:20.260]   You really want to spend these resources
[02:54:20.260 --> 02:54:21.100]   and build it into muscle.
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:22.720]   Because once we do that,
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:26.440]   it's very difficult to go backwards, break them back down
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:29.440]   and bring the amino acids back into that availability pool.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:32.680]   So we can use them for either another function entirely
[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:35.300]   or even another muscle group.
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:36.840]   That's called protein redistribution.
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:38.580]   By the way, when you say,
[02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:41.860]   maybe you don't do a lot of upper body work
[02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:44.380]   in your training and you're not eating enough protein
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:45.560]   or a minimal amount,
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:47.280]   and you're doing a lot of lifting in your legs.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:49.620]   You'll notice your legs will get larger,
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:50.760]   but that's actually a lot of times
[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:52.900]   you're pulling the protein from,
[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:54.000]   say your upper body in this case,
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.120]   and redistributing it back down to the quads.
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:00.300]   So that's what you have to get to.
[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:02.600]   And in terms of application, what numbers to hit,
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:05.400]   we can go through each one of our modifiable variables,
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:08.880]   just like we did with speed and strength and power
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:10.960]   and walk through some of our best practices
[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:12.240]   in each category.
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.600]   - Yes, so I'd love to talk about those modifiable variables
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:20.600]   as they relate to choice of movements,
[02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:23.740]   order of movements, volume,
[02:55:23.740 --> 02:55:27.940]   so sets and repetitions and frequency of training.
[02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:29.920]   And I'm particularly interested in frequency of training
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.360]   because that relates to the so-called split
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:35.940]   where typically one is not training
[02:55:35.940 --> 02:55:37.420]   their whole body every workout,
[02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:39.780]   although there are I'm sure hypertrophy workouts
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.840]   that are whole body workouts,
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:45.360]   but where people are dividing their body parts
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:47.080]   onto different days.
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:50.760]   So we'd love to go through this list one by one,
[02:55:50.760 --> 02:55:52.940]   starting with exercise choice.
[02:55:52.940 --> 02:55:53.920]   - Cool, great.
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:55:55.140]   So in the previous section,
[02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:57.760]   we pretty much said exclusively choose your exercises
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:55:58.900]   by the movement patterns.
[02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:01.000]   And you want to balance between pushing and pulling
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.760]   and rotation and things like that.
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:05.440]   In this particular case, you have the option to do either.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:06.760]   Here's my recommendation.
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:08.880]   Most people default almost exclusively
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:11.640]   to choosing by body parts here, right?
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:14.380]   I'm going to do calves and shoulders today
[02:56:14.380 --> 02:56:16.120]   and chest and back,
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:18.360]   whatever combinations of things they want.
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.240]   That is clearly effective strategy.
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:22.900]   However, many studies have actually been done
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:24.840]   where you choose by movement patterns
[02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:27.400]   and that is actually equally effective.
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:29.400]   Now, one little caveat I actually should have said
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:30.460]   a few minutes ago.
[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:33.200]   When we talk about the research on muscle hypertrophy,
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:35.320]   it is important to distinguish the fact
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:36.700]   that the vast majority of this research
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:40.220]   is coming from a novice to moderately trained individuals.
[02:56:40.220 --> 02:56:41.900]   There's actually more and more research coming out
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:42.980]   on trained individuals,
[02:56:42.980 --> 02:56:46.540]   but that's still moderately trained, right?
[02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:47.380]   Even those ones.
[02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:48.760]   So what happens in those people
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:51.040]   that are actually way past that point?
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:52.320]   We don't know scientifically.
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:53.900]   It's very difficult to do research there.
[02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:56.720]   So that's an important caveat I will acknowledge
[02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:58.400]   when I say, "Hey, you don't need to do this,"
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.080]   or, "You have to do this."
[02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:03.900]   You were assuming a training status of moderate to low.
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:06.700]   May or may not be true, past that.
[02:57:06.700 --> 02:57:07.620]   We don't know scientifically.
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:08.840]   I have certain thoughts personally,
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:11.220]   but the science will only take us that far.
[02:57:11.220 --> 02:57:15.900]   So that being said, you can actually choose by muscle
[02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:17.460]   or by movement pattern here,
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:19.200]   whichever is your personal preference.
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:22.040]   And this is actually where you can just become a good coach,
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:23.240]   whether you're coaching somebody else
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:25.540]   through this fitness journey or it's yourself,
[02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:27.360]   and give them a little bit of autonomy.
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:29.740]   So maybe you select the first three exercises
[02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:31.960]   and then let them select one every day.
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:34.200]   And so if they especially want to make sure
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:37.720]   that one muscle group grows, let them target that muscle.
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:38.740]   And maybe the rest of the day,
[02:57:38.740 --> 02:57:41.400]   you've actually split it up as push-pull
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:43.140]   or something else like that.
[02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:44.440]   All those strategies are effective.
[02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:46.920]   Personal preference, as long as the total amount of volume
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:50.000]   on the working muscle is equated throughout the week,
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.800]   which we'll get to those numbers in a second,
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:54.480]   then you're going to be in the exact same spot, no problem.
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:57.520]   I would actually generally encourage people
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:00.540]   to choose exercises in a variety of fashions.
[02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:02.520]   I actually think that it's important
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:05.160]   that you do some number of combination
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:08.600]   of what we call bilateral and unilateral exercises.
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:10.740]   So bilateral being, think about it like a squat,
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:12.580]   where bi meaning two, lateral,
[02:58:12.580 --> 02:58:16.240]   you have two feet on the ground moving in sequence here.
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:17.540]   Unilateral is one.
[02:58:17.540 --> 02:58:19.360]   So this could be something as simple
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:22.020]   as a rear foot elevated split squat.
[02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:24.840]   It could be a single leg leg press or single leg curl.
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:26.280]   It could be a pistol squat,
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:30.120]   something where the individual limb is moving one at a time.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:31.280]   You need to have a combination
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:33.840]   of bilateral and unilateral training.
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.300]   That's good to do for strength as well.
[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:37.480]   Probably not super important for power,
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:40.860]   but also very important for making sure,
[02:58:40.860 --> 02:58:45.160]   for hypertrophy's sake, you're not getting any imbalances
[02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:47.300]   as you progress, especially through months
[02:58:47.300 --> 02:58:48.560]   and years of training.
[02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:51.020]   So make sure you're doing a little bit of a combination.
[02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:53.240]   Whether you want to pick specific implements.
[02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:56.600]   That's really a methods question and a preference question.
[02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:58.360]   Then it is concepts.
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:00.420]   So dumbbell, great.
[02:59:00.420 --> 02:59:01.360]   Kettlebell, fine.
[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:02.640]   Barbell, awesome.
[02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:03.820]   Band, doesn't matter.
[02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:06.740]   Body weight, none of these things are as important
[02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:08.960]   because all you're trying to do is create a certain insult
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:11.640]   in the tissue and the implement is just whichever one
[02:59:11.640 --> 02:59:13.400]   you feel best doing it.
[02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:16.840]   And this is where actually machines come into play a lot.
[02:59:16.840 --> 02:59:19.340]   Machines are greatly underappreciated.
[02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:21.080]   They're a fantastic resource,
[02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:24.320]   especially somebody who's either early
[02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:26.040]   in their fitness journey,
[02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:28.640]   or somebody who really is having a hard time
[02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:32.600]   targeting a muscle group with a bigger compound movement.
[02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:34.920]   So when you're choosing exercises for hypertrophy,
[02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:36.160]   you're going to want to start
[02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:37.780]   with those bigger compound movements.
[02:59:37.780 --> 02:59:40.800]   That's going to drive a lot of the adaptation.
[02:59:40.800 --> 02:59:43.060]   You can get to these single joint movements
[02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:44.240]   like a little bit later.
[02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:45.880]   But having said that,
[02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:49.200]   because of the way that people move differently,
[02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:52.160]   their anthropometrics and their biomechanics
[02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:53.560]   and even their technique,
[02:59:53.560 --> 02:59:58.280]   the same exact exercise will not necessarily work
[02:59:58.280 --> 03:00:00.580]   the same exact muscle groups for multiple people.
[03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:03.920]   So if you and I both went and did a back squat,
[03:00:03.920 --> 03:00:05.400]   if you did it a little bit more
[03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:07.320]   of what we call a high bar squat,
[03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:09.120]   so this is the bar is literally sitting up higher
[03:00:09.120 --> 03:00:12.600]   up on your neck, you're keeping your back more vertical.
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:14.960]   And because in order to do that,
[03:00:14.960 --> 03:00:17.600]   you shift your knees much further past your toes,
[03:00:17.600 --> 03:00:19.600]   keeping, of course, your whole foot on the ground
[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:21.000]   in good position.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.120]   That's going to generally put more of an emphasis
[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:25.920]   on the knee joint.
[03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:27.700]   And so that's not a bad thing.
[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:30.880]   You tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there,
[03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:33.180]   a little bit less work in the spinal erectors and back
[03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:35.960]   because you're actually not supporting
[03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:37.320]   the weight horizontally,
[03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:39.340]   which it's a much more difficult position.
[03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:40.680]   It's vertically stacked.
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:44.360]   If I were to do it in the classic low bar squat,
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:47.020]   which is again, lowering the bar further down my back
[03:00:47.020 --> 03:00:49.300]   towards one more like my shoulder blades,
[03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:51.480]   I probably take a little bit of a wider stance.
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:54.700]   And when I squat, I drive my glutes back further away
[03:00:54.700 --> 03:00:55.740]   from the midline.
[03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:57.780]   In fact, as a general rule,
[03:00:57.780 --> 03:00:59.800]   if you take the midline of your body,
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:02.280]   the thing that moves is the farthest away from that midline
[03:01:02.280 --> 03:01:05.220]   is likely to be the thing that's activating the most.
[03:01:05.220 --> 03:01:07.540]   So in the case of the front squat,
[03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:10.680]   you're not generally going to be using your glutes as much
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:12.120]   if you're in that, or not even front squat,
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:14.140]   just that high bar squat where you're very, very vertical.
[03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:16.160]   Your knees are going to be moving very far over your toes,
[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:17.640]   which is fantastic.
[03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:19.240]   Therefore it's a little bit more knee dominant,
[03:01:19.240 --> 03:01:20.140]   as can we say it.
[03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:20.980]   The other version here,
[03:01:20.980 --> 03:01:23.000]   you can keep your shins really close to vertical.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.460]   You move your butt backwards.
[03:01:25.460 --> 03:01:28.200]   You're going to have to then lean forward with your torso,
[03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:30.300]   which means it'll be more low back, more glutes,
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:31.820]   and a little bit less knee.
[03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:33.060]   Now that's a general statement.
[03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:34.860]   It's not necessarily always true,
[03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:36.060]   but as a guideline there,
[03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:38.160]   that is one exact exercise where you may be going,
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:41.860]   "Man, I'm trying to improve this clear weakness
[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:43.000]   "I have in my quads.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:44.980]   "I can't even leg extension my body weight.
[03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:46.800]   "I have a significant problem there."
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:49.100]   So maybe in your particular case,
[03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:50.120]   if I'm hammering you,
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:52.080]   or you're hammering yourself in a squat exercise,
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:53.440]   and you're wondering why your quads
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:56.760]   aren't getting any stronger or growing in any size,
[03:01:56.760 --> 03:01:59.040]   it may be because of the style of the movement.
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:01.180]   So I may need to go, "Andrew, all right, look,
[03:02:01.180 --> 03:02:03.740]   "squats in general, if you look at the research,
[03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:05.900]   "are an excellent exercise for quad development."
[03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:07.340]   But for you, they're not.
[03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:08.760]   Because of the way you stand,
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:12.040]   or just because of neural activation, it doesn't matter.
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:13.840]   So I need to take you to a machine
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:15.360]   and isolate that muscle group
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.720]   so we can make sure we see development in that.
[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:20.720]   So if you're trying to grow a specific body part,
[03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:22.480]   area, individual muscle,
[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:23.680]   it's very important that you're
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:24.960]   actually seeing progress there.
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:27.760]   And don't worry about, well, in the textbook,
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:30.340]   the bench press is supposed to be good for your pec.
[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:32.040]   'Cause if you're not actually moving the right position,
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:33.760]   or it depends on the angle in which your sternum
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:35.720]   actually sits in your body,
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:37.160]   a bench press may actually be doing
[03:02:37.160 --> 03:02:38.880]   very little for your pec.
[03:02:38.880 --> 03:02:40.080]   And you may need to adjust to, say,
[03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:43.180]   an incline bench, or a decline bench, or a pec fly.
[03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:46.320]   So machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:49.240]   without having to worry about things like stability,
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:51.740]   your low back position, getting hurt, where's your neck at.
[03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:54.220]   You can really concentrate on just the movement,
[03:02:54.220 --> 03:02:56.020]   concentrate on the muscle,
[03:02:56.020 --> 03:02:57.500]   and let everything else kind of go away
[03:02:57.500 --> 03:03:01.140]   and ensure you're getting training in that specific area.
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:02.600]   - Those are excellent recommendations.
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.400]   One thing I wanted to ask about
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:07.360]   is prioritizing specific body parts,
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:10.400]   and therefore specific exercises.
[03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.120]   And here, I'm not necessarily referring
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:15.660]   to trying to bring up a so-called weak body part,
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:19.260]   an area that tends to be either genetically deficient,
[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:22.500]   'cause in some cases, I learned, for instance,
[03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:24.040]   having seen a lot of competitive
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:25.600]   track and field championships,
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:27.980]   I love watching track and field as a spectator,
[03:03:27.980 --> 03:03:30.020]   go up to Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there's a meet,
[03:03:30.020 --> 03:03:31.980]   and really love that.
[03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:34.160]   The sprinters are amazing.
[03:03:34.160 --> 03:03:36.660]   They have some of the highest calves in the world
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:40.020]   that I've ever seen, like little micro calves,
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:42.500]   but they're fast as hell.
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:43.340]   - They're right behind the knee,
[03:03:43.340 --> 03:03:45.000]   and they have a very long distance
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.380]   between that calf and their foot,
[03:03:46.380 --> 03:03:48.500]   which makes propulsion excellent.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:51.200]   - They wouldn't stand a chance as a competitive bodybuilder,
[03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:53.180]   but because something different
[03:03:53.180 --> 03:03:54.820]   is being selected for in bodybuilding,
[03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:58.620]   but obviously, they're magnificent for sprinting.
[03:03:58.620 --> 03:04:00.220]   Most people, of course, reside somewhere
[03:04:00.220 --> 03:04:03.640]   between the extreme of very long muscle bellies
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:07.820]   from origin to insertion, or very, very short muscles.
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:10.420]   Usually, people have one or two body parts
[03:04:10.420 --> 03:04:12.780]   that they want to emphasize, for whatever reason.
[03:04:12.780 --> 03:04:15.320]   These days, it seems to be people are really,
[03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:17.580]   what are they saying now, like glutes are the new biceps,
[03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:19.460]   or biceps are the new glutes, or I don't know.
[03:04:19.460 --> 03:04:20.780]   Anyway, you see this stuff.
[03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:22.200]   - I love 'em both.
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:25.100]   By the way, I am so pro curls in the squat rack.
[03:04:25.100 --> 03:04:25.940]   - There you go.
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:26.780]   - Love it, right.
[03:04:26.780 --> 03:04:27.600]   - There you go.
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:28.440]   - Nobody kill me.
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:30.360]   - So everyone has their thing
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:31.700]   that they would like to emphasize,
[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:33.460]   but I have a question because we're specifically
[03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:35.820]   talking about hypertrophy, which is,
[03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:39.200]   should people give themselves permission
[03:04:39.200 --> 03:04:41.500]   to not train a body part
[03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:44.220]   if their goal is balanced hypertrophy?
[03:04:44.220 --> 03:04:45.660]   I'll give a couple of examples.
[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:48.340]   One of the reasons why I, for instance,
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:51.020]   not done a lot of free weight squatting
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:54.400]   is because, despite my quadriceps being rather weak,
[03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:58.100]   according to you, they tend to grow rather easily
[03:04:58.100 --> 03:04:59.740]   relative to other muscle groups,
[03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:03.020]   and the goal for me has always been balanced development.
[03:05:03.020 --> 03:05:04.780]   And so I emphasize hamstring work,
[03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:08.620]   and I emphasize calf work and hamstring work.
[03:05:08.620 --> 03:05:10.140]   It's not that I don't train my quads at all,
[03:05:10.140 --> 03:05:12.200]   but I do far less for them,
[03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:15.820]   and I avoid the big compound movements for them.
[03:05:15.820 --> 03:05:16.880]   I occasionally do them.
[03:05:16.880 --> 03:05:19.680]   And again, this is not about what I do or don't do,
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:22.500]   but I think that in the context of a conversation
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.640]   about hypertrophy, is it appropriate
[03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:26.180]   to give people permission to say,
[03:05:26.180 --> 03:05:30.920]   listen, if you're just genetically strong, large lats,
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:32.560]   doing a lot of chin-ups and rows
[03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:34.380]   might actually be the worst thing for you
[03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:35.980]   if your goal is balanced development.
[03:05:35.980 --> 03:05:39.660]   And I ask because I don't often hear anyone,
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:44.660]   any credentialed people, give people permission
[03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:47.760]   to completely avoid training a given body part
[03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:50.120]   if their goal is balanced development,
[03:05:50.120 --> 03:05:53.500]   and yet I think most people who are resistance training
[03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:54.960]   are seeking balanced development.
[03:05:54.960 --> 03:05:57.520]   I don't know anybody that actively wants
[03:05:57.520 --> 03:05:59.100]   to have big upper body, small legs.
[03:05:59.100 --> 03:06:01.860]   I think that comes from neglect and laziness in most cases.
[03:06:01.860 --> 03:06:04.220]   Sometimes it's injury-related or other things.
[03:06:04.220 --> 03:06:07.180]   But I think this is an important point to raise
[03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:09.460]   that any good program for hypertrophy,
[03:06:09.460 --> 03:06:11.660]   I would think would have to take into account
[03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:14.700]   people's genetic and natural variation,
[03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:17.280]   sport-based variation in which muscle groups
[03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:18.780]   just tend to grow easily for them
[03:06:18.780 --> 03:06:22.040]   and which ones require a lot more focus and work.
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:23.620]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06:23.620 --> 03:06:25.660]   First of all, you have permission to do
[03:06:25.660 --> 03:06:27.460]   or not do anything you'd like to do
[03:06:27.460 --> 03:06:29.780]   in terms of hypertrophy training.
[03:06:29.780 --> 03:06:32.660]   I generally would not recommend disregarding
[03:06:32.660 --> 03:06:33.840]   a muscle group entirely.
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:35.340]   I know that's not what you actually suggested,
[03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:38.160]   but just to make sure that people didn't hear it that way.
[03:06:38.160 --> 03:06:40.140]   What I would do is in this example
[03:06:40.140 --> 03:06:41.780]   is I would continue to do those big movements.
[03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:43.580]   I would just keep the volume low.
[03:06:43.580 --> 03:06:47.880]   So I might do two sets or something twice a week.
[03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:48.880]   There's a whole bunch of reasons.
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:52.000]   You wanna make sure that those motor patterns are there.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.660]   You wanna make sure that the,
[03:06:53.660 --> 03:06:55.660]   especially the benefit of these compound movements
[03:06:55.660 --> 03:06:59.640]   is you get to work so many complimentary muscle movements
[03:06:59.640 --> 03:07:00.480]   at the same time.
[03:07:00.480 --> 03:07:02.320]   So in the case of like loaded squat,
[03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:05.180]   you're not only working stability in the hip
[03:07:05.180 --> 03:07:08.540]   as well as the knee, but you're also working upper body.
[03:07:08.540 --> 03:07:10.300]   Your rhomboids are keeping you in position.
[03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:11.700]   Your neck has to stay in position.
[03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:13.260]   Your toes, everything is working.
[03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:15.620]   And so it's really difficult to get those things
[03:07:15.620 --> 03:07:18.020]   when you take that movement out
[03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:22.320]   and you replace it with say a machine hamstring curl.
[03:07:22.320 --> 03:07:25.000]   That whole element of balance and neurological control
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:28.140]   is very, very important to maintain over time.
[03:07:28.140 --> 03:07:31.080]   And that just gets removed if you go to machines only.
[03:07:31.080 --> 03:07:33.780]   So I would keep some of those things in,
[03:07:33.780 --> 03:07:35.120]   maybe even not all year round,
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:37.040]   but maybe one quarter of the year, two quarters,
[03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:39.260]   every other rotate at something like that.
[03:07:39.260 --> 03:07:41.140]   As long as it is getting, you're not,
[03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:44.140]   if the reason you weren't doing say those squats was
[03:07:44.140 --> 03:07:45.520]   because you're like, ah, here's my back or something.
[03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:46.540]   Okay, great, then leave it out.
[03:07:46.540 --> 03:07:47.360]   But if it's just simply,
[03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:48.620]   you don't want your quads to go too much,
[03:07:48.620 --> 03:07:51.240]   I would just keep that volume low and do something
[03:07:51.240 --> 03:07:53.840]   just to kind of touch it, keep it activated
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:55.360]   and to maintain all those other things
[03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:58.280]   like flexibility, range of motion.
[03:07:58.280 --> 03:07:59.180]   I would bet anything,
[03:07:59.180 --> 03:08:01.900]   your adductors are probably underdeveloped, right?
[03:08:01.900 --> 03:08:03.660]   Now you can get those by doing your squats
[03:08:03.660 --> 03:08:04.780]   'cause you're not really doing, I'm sure,
[03:08:04.780 --> 03:08:06.940]   in much adduction training.
[03:08:06.940 --> 03:08:09.620]   And so there's things like that that just get lost
[03:08:09.620 --> 03:08:12.140]   when you're only thinking all big muscle groups
[03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:15.360]   that come inherent in doing the larger movements.
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:16.620]   And so you don't have to worry about them
[03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:17.940]   or train them separately.
[03:08:17.940 --> 03:08:18.760]   - I appreciate that.
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:23.560]   And in reality, I do two to three really hard work sets
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:26.100]   of hack machine squats per week,
[03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:27.940]   which is plenty for me to maintain
[03:08:27.940 --> 03:08:29.380]   and even get a little bit stronger.
[03:08:29.380 --> 03:08:33.060]   But per our earlier discussion, about a year ago,
[03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:35.900]   I shifted to doing very low repetition ranges
[03:08:35.900 --> 03:08:38.000]   to main strength in that movement,
[03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:41.340]   but I am actively avoiding hypertrophy in that muscle group.
[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:43.260]   - Yeah, or another solution would actually be
[03:08:43.260 --> 03:08:46.540]   do something like one set to failure a week.
[03:08:46.540 --> 03:08:47.540]   Not even extremely long,
[03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:51.460]   just do something in the eight to 15 repetition range
[03:08:51.460 --> 03:08:53.480]   at the end of all that strength set
[03:08:53.480 --> 03:08:55.940]   and just get a little bit of pump there and then do it.
[03:08:55.940 --> 03:08:58.700]   So just so that those muscles can touch that level of fatigue
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:01.140]   touch that level of strain and mechanical tension,
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:02.260]   walk away.
[03:09:02.260 --> 03:09:04.120]   - Great, thank you for that.
[03:09:04.120 --> 03:09:06.560]   What about exercise order?
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:07.400]   - Amazing.
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:10.280]   So implicit in this exercise choice thing,
[03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:13.020]   it's what you're gonna notice is these modifiable variables
[03:09:13.020 --> 03:09:14.600]   interact with each other, right?
[03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:17.500]   And you can clearly see how when we talked about volume
[03:09:17.500 --> 03:09:19.960]   and to clarify volume is the repetitions multiplied
[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:20.800]   by the sets.
[03:09:20.800 --> 03:09:22.340]   That's typically how we express volume.
[03:09:22.340 --> 03:09:24.460]   Well, that's gonna be directly influenced by intensity.
[03:09:24.460 --> 03:09:26.700]   The heavier load you put on the barbell,
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:28.180]   the less repetitions you can do.
[03:09:28.180 --> 03:09:29.700]   And the inverse, right?
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:32.300]   Rest intervals, the shorter you keep your rest intervals,
[03:09:32.300 --> 03:09:34.460]   then either the lower the weight has to go, the intensity,
[03:09:34.460 --> 03:09:36.180]   or the lower the rep range has to go.
[03:09:36.180 --> 03:09:37.740]   Order is the same thing.
[03:09:37.740 --> 03:09:38.740]   Choice is the same thing.
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:40.900]   So all of these things modify each other.
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:42.220]   They play a little bit of a hand
[03:09:42.220 --> 03:09:43.380]   in what everything else does.
[03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:46.020]   So with the exercise choice thing,
[03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:47.380]   rolling into exercise order,
[03:09:47.380 --> 03:09:49.120]   you get to play a couple of games here.
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:50.700]   When we talked about strength and power,
[03:09:50.700 --> 03:09:52.980]   I basically said stick to the big movements,
[03:09:52.980 --> 03:09:55.800]   most complicated and compound movements first.
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:58.420]   You don't have to do that with hypertrophy.
[03:09:58.420 --> 03:10:00.140]   You can do this in a couple of ways.
[03:10:00.140 --> 03:10:00.980]   You can do the thing
[03:10:00.980 --> 03:10:03.720]   you're just simply most interested in first.
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:05.540]   You can do this thing called pre-fatigue.
[03:10:05.540 --> 03:10:08.100]   So say you're going to do a back day.
[03:10:08.100 --> 03:10:10.580]   You could go in and do nothing but isolated biceps
[03:10:10.580 --> 03:10:12.220]   as your very first exercise
[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:15.580]   and then roll into your pulling movements
[03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:17.840]   because what you'll see is during most pulling activities,
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:20.540]   the biceps are a secondary or tertiary muscle group,
[03:10:20.540 --> 03:10:21.620]   but you've pre-fatigued them.
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:23.620]   You've guaranteed that muscle of most interest
[03:10:23.620 --> 03:10:25.620]   that it's most training in
[03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:27.040]   and everything else is secondary.
[03:10:27.040 --> 03:10:29.880]   So you can start if you want with single joint movements,
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:31.180]   you can start with isolation stuff
[03:10:31.180 --> 03:10:33.620]   or you can start with compound stuff.
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:35.460]   Either way, it just really comes down to preference
[03:10:35.460 --> 03:10:38.740]   and what you're specifically trying to develop.
[03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:42.340]   Now this also goes back to the exercise choice question
[03:10:42.340 --> 03:10:44.060]   'cause it's sort of the same thing.
[03:10:44.060 --> 03:10:46.220]   Like which one am I choosing?
[03:10:46.220 --> 03:10:50.500]   And where I wanted it to cap this was the exercise splits.
[03:10:50.500 --> 03:10:52.260]   And so we just sort of talked about
[03:10:52.260 --> 03:10:53.700]   am I doing body part splits?
[03:10:53.700 --> 03:10:55.100]   And I know a question I get a lot here is,
[03:10:55.100 --> 03:10:57.740]   well, which ones should I package together?
[03:10:57.740 --> 03:10:59.600]   I'm not really concerned with it.
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:02.460]   All you should worry about is how many times per week
[03:11:02.460 --> 03:11:04.620]   and in fact, total volume you achieve
[03:11:04.620 --> 03:11:07.100]   on a muscle group per week.
[03:11:07.100 --> 03:11:08.740]   And it doesn't really matter
[03:11:08.740 --> 03:11:10.140]   how those things are folded in.
[03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:12.740]   It's really a personal preference issue.
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:15.540]   One mistake that we see here commonly
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:18.300]   is grossly under appreciating
[03:11:18.300 --> 03:11:21.720]   that the legs are not a muscle group, right?
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:25.080]   So the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them.
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:26.580]   So we see a classic split
[03:11:26.580 --> 03:11:30.100]   like I'll do shoulders and chest Monday
[03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:35.060]   and then I'll do biceps and forearms Tuesday
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:37.860]   and then legs Wednesday or whatever.
[03:11:37.860 --> 03:11:39.180]   And then back to upper body.
[03:11:39.180 --> 03:11:41.220]   And then I was like, you're like, wait a minute.
[03:11:41.220 --> 03:11:43.420]   You have four days dedicated to the upper body
[03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:45.380]   and one for quote unquote legs.
[03:11:46.520 --> 03:11:49.080]   Well, like I hope you can see the imbalance
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:50.380]   that's going to happen over time
[03:11:50.380 --> 03:11:52.960]   is you're going to do far more upper body
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:55.060]   than you are lower body and that's not appropriate.
[03:11:55.060 --> 03:11:56.620]   So you just wanna think about your lower body
[03:11:56.620 --> 03:11:57.760]   like you would do.
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:11:59.100]   If you're gonna do body part splits,
[03:11:59.100 --> 03:12:00.700]   then include those things as well
[03:12:00.700 --> 03:12:03.700]   and not just chunk everything in as legs once a week.
[03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:05.700]   If you wanna do that, that's actually okay.
[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:07.900]   But that day has to be very, very challenging
[03:12:07.900 --> 03:12:10.740]   and you probably should do quite a bit of volume there
[03:12:10.740 --> 03:12:12.500]   'cause you're almost surely not going to hit
[03:12:12.500 --> 03:12:15.740]   the total weekly volume needed to optimize muscle growth
[03:12:15.740 --> 03:12:18.120]   if you're literally only doing once a week
[03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:20.220]   of your quote unquote legs.
[03:12:20.220 --> 03:12:23.400]   - So along those lines, let's talk volume.
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:27.500]   How much volume does each muscle group need per week
[03:12:27.500 --> 03:12:30.620]   in order to generate and for that matter,
[03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:31.980]   maintain hypertrophy?
[03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:34.120]   - Right, so the kind of minimum number
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:36.840]   we're gonna look for here is 10 working sets.
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:37.880]   - Per week. - Correct.
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:39.180]   - Per muscle group. - Correct.
[03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:43.060]   - And just to make sure that everyone's on the same page,
[03:12:43.060 --> 03:12:45.860]   if I do a chin up or a pull up,
[03:12:45.860 --> 03:12:51.540]   I'm going to mainly be training my back muscles, my lats,
[03:12:51.540 --> 03:12:52.520]   if I'm doing it correctly.
[03:12:52.520 --> 03:12:53.860]   - Lats and rhomboids and biceps.
[03:12:53.860 --> 03:12:58.220]   - Right, but there'll be indirect targeting of the biceps.
[03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:01.980]   So would you include indirect targeting?
[03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:04.740]   So for instance, if you said 10 sets per week,
[03:13:04.740 --> 03:13:05.740]   let's just use biceps
[03:13:05.740 --> 03:13:09.620]   'cause it seems that that's the go-to generic muscle.
[03:13:09.620 --> 03:13:10.460]   Why is that, by the way?
[03:13:10.460 --> 03:13:12.980]   That when people ask somebody to flex their muscle,
[03:13:12.980 --> 03:13:13.860]   they always flex their bicep.
[03:13:13.860 --> 03:13:15.640]   They don't flex their calf or their quad
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:16.540]   or their glutes or something.
[03:13:16.540 --> 03:13:19.020]   I guess there's some public decency issues.
[03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:21.660]   - Well, I can tell you with my children,
[03:13:21.660 --> 03:13:23.420]   that's the very first muscle I taught them to flex.
[03:13:23.420 --> 03:13:24.260]   - Their glutes?
[03:13:24.260 --> 03:13:25.100]   - No, their biceps.
[03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:26.740]   - Oh, I was gonna say, all right.
[03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:31.020]   Good, good.
[03:13:31.020 --> 03:13:33.780]   Healthy parenting advice from Dr. Andy Galpin.
[03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:37.360]   So if it's 10 sets per week for biceps
[03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:40.820]   in order to maintain or further grow the biceps,
[03:13:40.820 --> 03:13:44.960]   but does that mean if somebody does 10 sets of chin-ups
[03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:46.660]   or 10 sets of chin-ups in rows,
[03:13:46.660 --> 03:13:49.820]   that they are checking off any of the boxes for biceps,
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:52.580]   assuming that they're doing the movement properly
[03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:55.140]   and targeting the major muscle group
[03:13:55.140 --> 03:13:57.240]   that a given movement is supposed to target,
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:00.140]   which in my mind, when you're doing a chin-up,
[03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:02.480]   you're supposed to mainly be using your back muscles.
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:04.540]   And then there are secondary muscles
[03:14:04.540 --> 03:14:07.500]   or secondary activation of other muscles.
[03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:08.860]   But of course, some people,
[03:14:08.860 --> 03:14:11.200]   their arms grow like crazy when they do chin-ups
[03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:12.260]   and their back doesn't grow at all.
[03:14:12.260 --> 03:14:13.100]   So this is where we're back
[03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:18.100]   to the kind of genetic preloading of the system, if you will.
[03:14:18.100 --> 03:14:23.340]   So how does one meet this 10 sets per week minimum
[03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:25.020]   when dividing different body parts
[03:14:25.020 --> 03:14:28.420]   and thinking about this direct and indirect activation?
[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:31.400]   - So two things, there's no specific exact rule here.
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:34.360]   And this is why these set ranges are ranges, right?
[03:14:34.360 --> 03:14:36.340]   And this is why we don't say like 10 is,
[03:14:36.340 --> 03:14:38.700]   so 10 would be sort of the minimum number you wanna get to.
[03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:41.140]   The more realistic number that most people,
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:44.180]   especially if you're advanced or even intermediate,
[03:14:44.180 --> 03:14:48.100]   is more like 15 to 20 working sets per week, okay?
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:49.320]   Now, if you're very well-trained,
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:51.820]   you probably wanna even push more towards like 25.
[03:14:51.820 --> 03:14:55.960]   And in fact, past that, there's not a lot of research.
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:14:57.640]   So the optimal number may be 30.
[03:14:57.640 --> 03:14:58.540]   We don't really know.
[03:14:58.540 --> 03:15:01.020]   It's just hard to get that much work in.
[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:02.340]   It may actually even be detrimental.
[03:15:02.340 --> 03:15:04.500]   - And here we're referring to natural athletes,
[03:15:04.500 --> 03:15:08.180]   that is people who, for whatever reason,
[03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:10.540]   either because they're not taking any prescription drugs
[03:15:10.540 --> 03:15:15.540]   or maybe if they are, whose levels of steroid hormones,
[03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:19.580]   mainly the androgens, like testosterone, et cetera,
[03:15:19.580 --> 03:15:22.940]   do not exceed the normal reference range values,
[03:15:22.940 --> 03:15:24.500]   either because that's what they are naturally
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:26.780]   or that's what they're replacing through pharmacology.
[03:15:26.780 --> 03:15:28.340]   Whereas when we think of,
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:32.560]   technically someone could be taking exogenous hormones
[03:15:32.560 --> 03:15:34.140]   to replace a deficiency,
[03:15:34.140 --> 03:15:36.060]   and then there's still a normal range, okay.
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:39.840]   But I just wanna clarify because you work with athletes
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:40.740]   in a number of different sports
[03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:43.380]   where drugs are and are not tolerated, et cetera,
[03:15:43.380 --> 03:15:44.740]   and the general population,
[03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:46.220]   that what we are talking about here
[03:15:46.220 --> 03:15:47.740]   is for the general population,
[03:15:47.740 --> 03:15:49.220]   not for steroid-using athletes.
[03:15:49.220 --> 03:15:50.060]   - Correct. - Okay.
[03:15:50.060 --> 03:15:51.700]   - Yep. - Great.
[03:15:51.700 --> 03:15:53.420]   - So 10 was just sort of that like
[03:15:53.420 --> 03:15:55.100]   absolute minimum number to maintain,
[03:15:55.100 --> 03:15:56.060]   which is actually pretty cool.
[03:15:56.060 --> 03:15:57.820]   If you think about it this way,
[03:15:57.820 --> 03:16:01.340]   if you went in and you did three sets of 10,
[03:16:01.340 --> 03:16:03.220]   it's a very standard rule. - Three sets of 10 repetitions.
[03:16:03.220 --> 03:16:04.420]   - Correct. - Yeah.
[03:16:04.420 --> 03:16:05.340]   - You're already at three.
[03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:07.340]   You did that three days a week.
[03:16:07.340 --> 03:16:08.940]   You're at your nine, that's almost 10.
[03:16:08.940 --> 03:16:11.340]   If you also just went to the gym one day a week,
[03:16:11.340 --> 03:16:15.380]   you did three sets of 10 and you did three exercises,
[03:16:15.380 --> 03:16:17.780]   you're at nine working sets, you're basically done.
[03:16:17.780 --> 03:16:20.620]   So achieving 10 sets per week per muscle group,
[03:16:20.620 --> 03:16:21.780]   and now we're not even talking
[03:16:21.780 --> 03:16:24.480]   about indirect activation of a secondary.
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:27.680]   So you're going to hit 10 fairly easy.
[03:16:27.680 --> 03:16:32.180]   Extension of that, hitting 20 is actually still not that hard
[03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:33.940]   because of what's actually gonna happen there.
[03:16:33.940 --> 03:16:36.300]   So in your example, if you're doing your chin ups,
[03:16:36.300 --> 03:16:39.120]   well, would the biceps count?
[03:16:39.120 --> 03:16:40.580]   There's no exact rule there
[03:16:40.580 --> 03:16:43.340]   because there could be technique issues.
[03:16:43.340 --> 03:16:44.180]   It could be hand position.
[03:16:44.180 --> 03:16:45.860]   So you mentioned chin up very specifically.
[03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:48.180]   A chin up is actually gonna put your hands
[03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:50.220]   in this position where your palms are facing up, right?
[03:16:50.220 --> 03:16:51.520]   This is supination and pronation.
[03:16:51.520 --> 03:16:52.420]   So you're gonna be there.
[03:16:52.420 --> 03:16:54.820]   Well, that's actually quite different than a pull up
[03:16:54.820 --> 03:16:56.720]   where your hands are in the opposite direction.
[03:16:56.720 --> 03:16:59.940]   So a chin up actually is gonna be pretty good activator
[03:16:59.940 --> 03:17:02.500]   in your biceps for most people.
[03:17:02.500 --> 03:17:05.100]   So you would expect actually to probably count that
[03:17:05.100 --> 03:17:06.540]   'cause it's gonna be very difficult
[03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:08.220]   to not see some fatigue in your biceps
[03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:10.780]   depending on your mechanics,
[03:17:10.780 --> 03:17:12.860]   depending on, and by that I mean,
[03:17:12.860 --> 03:17:16.300]   just the segment lengths of your bones, right?
[03:17:16.300 --> 03:17:19.280]   That's where your muscles originate and insert.
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:20.280]   There's nothing you can do about it.
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:21.880]   It's not even a technique or a focus issue.
[03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:23.340]   It's just simple fact, the matter of
[03:17:23.340 --> 03:17:25.900]   that's how you pull best in that area.
[03:17:25.900 --> 03:17:28.620]   The position of what your hands are on the barbell,
[03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:29.980]   wider grip, more narrow grip,
[03:17:29.980 --> 03:17:31.620]   it's going to change muscle use.
[03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:34.180]   So we talked about earlier,
[03:17:34.180 --> 03:17:36.780]   I think in the previous episode that
[03:17:36.780 --> 03:17:39.460]   exercises do not determine adaptations, applications too,
[03:17:39.460 --> 03:17:43.180]   but exercises do determine things like the movement plane,
[03:17:43.180 --> 03:17:44.640]   the joint you use,
[03:17:44.640 --> 03:17:48.220]   and typically the eccentric concentric sort of ratio,
[03:17:48.220 --> 03:17:51.460]   as well as oftentimes the muscle groups involved.
[03:17:51.460 --> 03:17:54.260]   So there's just not a lot of things you can do
[03:17:54.260 --> 03:17:56.740]   depending on how you are built of, you know,
[03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:59.340]   some exercises activating a secondary group
[03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:00.180]   and you don't want it.
[03:18:00.180 --> 03:18:02.260]   It's not always a technique issue, may just be,
[03:18:02.260 --> 03:18:04.220]   that's how you're built, right?
[03:18:04.220 --> 03:18:07.180]   And the same could be true for a squat.
[03:18:07.180 --> 03:18:09.260]   The high bar versus low bar sort of example
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:10.140]   we talked about earlier.
[03:18:10.140 --> 03:18:13.820]   It's, you know, you can see plenty of evidence
[03:18:13.820 --> 03:18:17.140]   on muscle activation studies where people even doing
[03:18:17.140 --> 03:18:19.900]   the vertical back squat style have tremendous
[03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:22.960]   glute activation and folks doing the low bar
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:24.980]   have tremendous quad activation.
[03:18:24.980 --> 03:18:27.060]   So a lot of it depends on personal mechanics.
[03:18:27.060 --> 03:18:28.880]   So what I counted is the question.
[03:18:28.880 --> 03:18:31.880]   Really, you just have to ask yourself, number one,
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:33.540]   do you really care that much?
[03:18:33.540 --> 03:18:35.180]   You know you have a range to get to.
[03:18:35.180 --> 03:18:37.860]   If you were anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets,
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:39.020]   you know you're fine.
[03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:40.960]   So if you count it or don't count it,
[03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:42.020]   it's just gonna change the difference
[03:18:42.020 --> 03:18:44.440]   between whether you did 17 working sets or 23.
[03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:45.500]   And either way, you're fine.
[03:18:45.500 --> 03:18:47.020]   So I don't really care.
[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:49.860]   Number two, are you actually feeling anything there?
[03:18:49.860 --> 03:18:51.340]   So if you're doing your chin ups
[03:18:51.340 --> 03:18:54.580]   and your biceps are blowing up, I'm counting that, right?
[03:18:54.580 --> 03:18:55.420]   If you're doing it and you're like,
[03:18:55.420 --> 03:18:57.340]   no, I don't feel any fatigue there, it's all my,
[03:18:57.340 --> 03:18:58.220]   then I'd probably say, okay,
[03:18:58.220 --> 03:18:59.720]   we're not even gonna count that as towards it.
[03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:02.320]   So you can just let that guide you a little bit
[03:19:02.320 --> 03:19:03.780]   towards your count.
[03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:04.960]   - Yeah, I've always noticed
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:07.000]   that there are certain muscle groups
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:11.880]   that are very easy to isolate when under load.
[03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:15.280]   And those are almost always the same muscle groups
[03:19:15.280 --> 03:19:19.560]   that are easy to contract very hard
[03:19:19.560 --> 03:19:21.200]   without any load whatsoever.
[03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:22.040]   - Bingo.
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:23.560]   You know, that's actually really insightful.
[03:19:23.560 --> 03:19:26.620]   So you can kind of use this heuristic of like,
[03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:29.720]   if you can contract your lats just standing here,
[03:19:29.720 --> 03:19:31.380]   you're probably going to contract them very well
[03:19:31.380 --> 03:19:32.220]   when you lift.
[03:19:32.220 --> 03:19:34.280]   If you can't, you can probably assume
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:35.640]   about the same thing's gonna happen.
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:38.520]   So yeah, you'll know.
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:39.360]   This is actually,
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:41.540]   the lats are actually really interesting
[03:19:41.540 --> 03:19:43.520]   because they tend to be one of the more difficult
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:45.840]   muscle groups to learn how to activate.
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:47.400]   So if you're in your journey and you're just like,
[03:19:47.400 --> 03:19:48.260]   I have no idea.
[03:19:48.260 --> 03:19:51.500]   And you can look up like a lat pose.
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:53.100]   So how do you like, how do you puff your lats out?
[03:19:53.100 --> 03:19:53.940]   How do you show it?
[03:19:53.940 --> 03:19:55.460]   And if you do that and you're like, wow,
[03:19:55.460 --> 03:19:57.420]   there's no movement here.
[03:19:57.420 --> 03:19:59.680]   Just recognize that's extremely common.
[03:19:59.680 --> 03:20:01.720]   And that is probably going to take you many, many,
[03:20:01.720 --> 03:20:04.720]   many months of trying before you start to see some movements
[03:20:04.720 --> 03:20:06.000]   and probably even a few years
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:07.620]   before you really start to see activation.
[03:20:07.620 --> 03:20:09.920]   So you're not some sort of like specific,
[03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:12.320]   like special genetic anomaly.
[03:20:12.320 --> 03:20:13.480]   It's very, very common.
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:17.480]   It's uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps, right?
[03:20:17.480 --> 03:20:18.340]   That everyone can do that.
[03:20:18.340 --> 03:20:21.300]   But if you're just like, man, I can't get this here.
[03:20:21.300 --> 03:20:22.460]   I'm just gonna stop doing it.
[03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:23.320]   Do not do that.
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:25.500]   Just keep at it and just keep concentrating
[03:20:25.500 --> 03:20:26.780]   and thinking about the muscle group.
[03:20:26.780 --> 03:20:27.780]   It will take some time.
[03:20:27.780 --> 03:20:31.720]   It's very common to have challenges activating lats.
[03:20:31.720 --> 03:20:34.860]   - Yeah, I've noticed that many of the muscle groups
[03:20:34.860 --> 03:20:38.580]   that were responsible for a large fraction of the work
[03:20:38.580 --> 03:20:42.140]   in the various sports that I played as a young child
[03:20:42.140 --> 03:20:45.340]   are muscles that are very easy for me
[03:20:45.340 --> 03:20:49.200]   to selectively isolate and induce hypertrophy in.
[03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:50.520]   I suppose I'm one of those mutants
[03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:54.100]   where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle groups.
[03:20:54.100 --> 03:20:56.380]   But I think that's because I swam a lot when I was a kid.
[03:20:56.380 --> 03:20:57.860]   - I was literally going to ask when you were a swimmer.
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:20:59.420]   - Yeah. - That's like a telltale sign.
[03:20:59.420 --> 03:21:01.720]   - Every kid in my town swam and played soccer.
[03:21:01.720 --> 03:21:02.560]   - There you go.
[03:21:02.560 --> 03:21:06.640]   - And then later I skateboarded and did some boxing
[03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:07.480]   and things of that sort. - You generally hear
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:08.920]   that answer is you either were a swimmer
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:10.600]   or you were a wrestler.
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:12.300]   So it's like that pulling and pull toward you
[03:21:12.300 --> 03:21:15.440]   is thousands of repetitions allowed you
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:16.960]   to get very good at contracting.
[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.860]   But because I also played soccer and skateboarding
[03:21:20.860 --> 03:21:23.960]   but I didn't do any baseball, basketball or football,
[03:21:23.960 --> 03:21:26.520]   muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging
[03:21:26.520 --> 03:21:28.040]   to activate and isolate. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:21:28.040 --> 03:21:29.920]   - So I do think that early development
[03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:32.760]   is superimposed on a genetic template
[03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:35.320]   that sort of predicts which muscle groups
[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:37.960]   are going to be easier or harder to isolate and train.
[03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:40.020]   - It's also a very good case for why it's important
[03:21:40.020 --> 03:21:43.220]   to do as many different athletic activities
[03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:44.920]   as you can in your youth.
[03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:46.940]   - Yeah, and if you do skateboard,
[03:21:46.940 --> 03:21:48.600]   definitely learn to ride switch.
[03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:50.920]   'Cause every skateboarder I know
[03:21:50.920 --> 03:21:52.520]   has one leg that's larger than the other
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:54.480]   and one calf that's larger than the other.
[03:21:54.480 --> 03:21:55.960]   And actually, for that matter,
[03:21:55.960 --> 03:21:58.320]   people that do martial arts, they don't learn to,
[03:21:58.320 --> 03:22:00.360]   if they're not southpaw, if they don't learn to switch up
[03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:03.460]   and do their work southpaw, you see the same thing.
[03:22:03.460 --> 03:22:05.840]   I mean, you're building an asymmetry into the system
[03:22:05.840 --> 03:22:08.560]   and it's not just muscular, it's neural.
[03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:10.780]   - Oh, sure. - It's strongly neural.
[03:22:10.780 --> 03:22:14.140]   So yeah, kids, parents, get your kids doing
[03:22:14.140 --> 03:22:15.400]   a bunch of different things.
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:17.960]   I suppose gymnastics would probably be the best sport
[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:20.840]   all around in terms of movement in multiple planes
[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:23.520]   and activating all the different muscle groups.
[03:22:23.520 --> 03:22:24.480]   - Yes and no.
[03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:27.680]   There's a lot of benefit, no question about it.
[03:22:27.680 --> 03:22:29.040]   There's a lot of other things though
[03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:30.500]   that has limited ability.
[03:22:30.500 --> 03:22:33.700]   So almost everything in, not like gymnastics is great,
[03:22:33.700 --> 03:22:36.240]   but almost everything in that is pre-planned,
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:37.680]   which is a major downfall, right?
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:39.960]   So the joy of skating is there's so much
[03:22:39.960 --> 03:22:42.400]   proprioceptive input that you have to make decisions
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:44.860]   very quickly in small windows.
[03:22:44.860 --> 03:22:45.700]   Now you have a little bit of that
[03:22:45.700 --> 03:22:47.260]   when you're flipping in the air and you have to land,
[03:22:47.260 --> 03:22:50.360]   but gymnastics, gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine
[03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:51.940]   that they're working on and they work on that routine
[03:22:51.940 --> 03:22:53.660]   for years and go at it.
[03:22:53.660 --> 03:22:57.200]   - Skateboarding for me was transportation, it was freedom,
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:59.940]   and it didn't require any coaches or parental oversight.
[03:22:59.940 --> 03:23:02.200]   - Yeah, yeah, ball sports have the beauty of reaction
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:03.040]   and things like that.
[03:23:03.040 --> 03:23:04.440]   So all of them were wonderful.
[03:23:04.440 --> 03:23:07.680]   Yeah, good to do a lot of them.
[03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:11.780]   - You've established that 10 really to 20 sets per week
[03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:15.460]   is the kind of bounds for maintaining
[03:23:15.460 --> 03:23:17.580]   and initiating hypertrophy.
[03:23:17.580 --> 03:23:19.760]   - Yep, if I were to like flag one of them,
[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:21.940]   I would say 15 to 20 is the sets
[03:23:21.940 --> 03:23:23.320]   that you want to get working.
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:26.140]   Now it gets complicated when you ask,
[03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:29.540]   well, how many reps per set do I have to get to?
[03:23:29.540 --> 03:23:32.500]   Okay, well, we also can complicate that
[03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:34.840]   by repetition type and tempo.
[03:23:34.840 --> 03:23:37.560]   Just sort of let all that go for now and just think,
[03:23:37.560 --> 03:23:41.700]   if you're getting close to that range, you're in the spot.
[03:23:41.700 --> 03:23:45.080]   And all you have to do now is balance two things,
[03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:47.240]   recovery and continued training.
[03:23:47.240 --> 03:23:49.220]   Okay, so if you're somewhere in this 10 to 20
[03:23:49.220 --> 03:23:52.800]   working sets range and you're in a position
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:54.320]   where you can continue to do that,
[03:23:54.320 --> 03:23:57.260]   you're not so sore and so damaged and beat up
[03:23:57.260 --> 03:24:00.500]   that you can't maintain that volume for eight weeks
[03:24:00.500 --> 03:24:02.740]   at a time or at least six weeks at a time,
[03:24:02.740 --> 03:24:05.820]   then I'd probably say either the style of repetitions,
[03:24:05.820 --> 03:24:07.920]   the amount of repetitions per set you're doing are too much.
[03:24:07.920 --> 03:24:09.400]   The volume is getting to you.
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:11.840]   However, if you're not seeing adaptations,
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:14.260]   then I'd say maybe the repetitions aren't enough.
[03:24:14.260 --> 03:24:16.460]   And so that's the kind of game you're running.
[03:24:16.460 --> 03:24:18.360]   Now there could be plenty of other factors.
[03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:19.240]   - Intensity.
[03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:23.160]   - Of course, yeah, intensity, intent,
[03:24:23.160 --> 03:24:24.560]   and then of course the other things,
[03:24:24.560 --> 03:24:26.760]   sleep, nutrition, et cetera.
[03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:29.980]   All these other things that go into our visible stressor
[03:24:29.980 --> 03:24:32.080]   category that we always analyze.
[03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:33.400]   This sort of brings up this idea
[03:24:33.400 --> 03:24:34.840]   of responders and non-responders.
[03:24:34.840 --> 03:24:37.000]   So we get this one a ton.
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:40.880]   So why is it some people, my gym buddy, my roommate,
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:42.080]   we go to sleep the same time,
[03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:45.080]   we're on the same nutrition plan, we work out together,
[03:24:45.080 --> 03:24:46.580]   she triples in muscle size
[03:24:46.580 --> 03:24:49.300]   and I don't have like no gain whatsoever.
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:51.460]   Well, there's a lot of work that we're trying to do
[03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:54.720]   to identify the molecular mechanisms behind responders
[03:24:54.720 --> 03:24:56.560]   and non-responders 'cause they clearly exist.
[03:24:56.560 --> 03:24:59.560]   In fact, this is one of the reasons why every paper
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:02.700]   I basically will ever publish again if I do,
[03:25:02.700 --> 03:25:05.720]   always reports individual person data.
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:07.940]   So rather than group averages, you get to see,
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:08.920]   if there's 10 subjects in it,
[03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:11.380]   you get to see how each of the 10 responded.
[03:25:11.380 --> 03:25:14.480]   Because the group average can get confusing,
[03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:17.240]   what you really wanna see is how many actually people
[03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:19.480]   got better, how many got worse,
[03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:21.500]   how many maybe changed and if so.
[03:25:21.500 --> 03:25:23.100]   So we'll always report those individual data
[03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:25.840]   'cause when you go to train, you're you,
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:27.000]   you're not the group average.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.960]   That's very important to know.
[03:25:28.960 --> 03:25:31.940]   So if you do that, you can see a beautiful line
[03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:33.920]   of these hyper-responders,
[03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:35.640]   the bell curve in the middle of the normal responders
[03:25:35.640 --> 03:25:38.240]   and those folks who like through any training study
[03:25:38.240 --> 03:25:39.640]   just won't get any better.
[03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:42.020]   If you can tease out, which you can't,
[03:25:42.020 --> 03:25:43.560]   but let's say in science you could tease out
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:47.080]   all the extra factors, total stress load, hydration, sleep,
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:50.600]   et cetera, what you often see is non-responders,
[03:25:50.600 --> 03:25:52.100]   a lot of the time, it's not that they have
[03:25:52.100 --> 03:25:54.600]   a physiological inability, it's just that they need
[03:25:54.600 --> 03:25:55.880]   a different protocol.
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:25:58.320]   And a lot of times it's they just need more volume.
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:25:59.840]   So if they can handle that and they're not
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:01.400]   excessively beat up, just give them more volume
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:03.960]   and they tend to see a lot of breakthroughs.
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:06.600]   You see the same thing with plateaus.
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:07.960]   So typically it's sort of just like, okay,
[03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:10.440]   the routine you're on, you've been on it for too long,
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:11.860]   we need to either go to the other end
[03:26:11.860 --> 03:26:14.080]   of the hypertrophy spectrum for intensity,
[03:26:14.080 --> 03:26:17.480]   which means like if you've been in the like 60 to 70%,
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:19.560]   everyone repetition max range,
[03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:21.720]   maybe we actually need to go heavier,
[03:26:21.720 --> 03:26:23.300]   take our repetitions down,
[03:26:23.300 --> 03:26:25.240]   maybe even our total volume down and go heavier.
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:28.460]   Try that, a great way to break through plateaus of grain
[03:26:28.460 --> 03:26:30.200]   if all the other boxes are checked.
[03:26:31.140 --> 03:26:33.720]   The other one is do the opposite, which is like, okay,
[03:26:33.720 --> 03:26:35.940]   we're gonna go higher, we're gonna go sets of 20,
[03:26:35.940 --> 03:26:38.740]   sets of 25, very high repetition range
[03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:41.560]   and really get after it, not to do as much damage
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:43.140]   'cause you don't tend to get as sore
[03:26:43.140 --> 03:26:45.360]   from those really high repetition ranges.
[03:26:45.360 --> 03:26:47.560]   You'll get more sore from the lower repetition,
[03:26:47.560 --> 03:26:50.140]   higher intensity range than you will typically
[03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:52.880]   the other ones and see if we can bust through
[03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:53.720]   some plateaus there.
[03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:55.620]   So it just generally means you need to do something
[03:26:55.620 --> 03:26:58.560]   a little bit different than your training partner.
[03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:00.240]   - So we've talked about exercise choice
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:03.200]   and we've talked about the number of sets that one needs
[03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:06.600]   in order to induce hypertrophy per week.
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:08.160]   What about repetition ranges?
[03:27:08.160 --> 03:27:11.560]   You've mentioned pretty broad repetition ranges.
[03:27:11.560 --> 03:27:15.120]   How many repetitions per set is required
[03:27:15.120 --> 03:27:16.400]   in order to induce hypertrophy?
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:18.840]   - Yep, so there are two caveats here before I give,
[03:27:18.840 --> 03:27:23.200]   well, the number is somewhere between like four to 30 reps.
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:24.360]   - 30 repetitions.
[03:27:24.360 --> 03:27:26.340]   - Absolutely, in fact, I think you can go much higher.
[03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:30.720]   - The first 20 have to feel exceedingly light.
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:31.600]   - Correct.
[03:27:31.600 --> 03:27:34.420]   - And during those first 20 or so repetitions,
[03:27:34.420 --> 03:27:36.220]   is the goal still to contract the muscle
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:38.300]   as hard as possible on each repetition?
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:40.060]   - So this is the caveats here.
[03:27:40.060 --> 03:27:45.060]   So caveat number one is there is an assumption
[03:27:45.060 --> 03:27:48.320]   that by the end of this set,
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:51.020]   you're getting somewhat close to failure.
[03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:53.820]   And so you don't have to go to absolute failure
[03:27:55.260 --> 03:27:56.600]   to induce muscle hypertrophy,
[03:27:56.600 --> 03:27:59.560]   but you also have to get kind of close.
[03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:01.860]   So if you're gonna do a set of 25 and you finish it
[03:28:01.860 --> 03:28:03.700]   and you're like, ooh, yeah,
[03:28:03.700 --> 03:28:05.860]   like that was kind of starting to get hard at the end.
[03:28:05.860 --> 03:28:07.620]   That's not going to be enough.
[03:28:07.620 --> 03:28:09.400]   If you're gonna do a set of five or six
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:11.300]   and the same sort of expression comes out of your mouth,
[03:28:11.300 --> 03:28:12.700]   it's not gonna be, so in that case,
[03:28:12.700 --> 03:28:15.100]   it doesn't matter your rep range
[03:28:15.100 --> 03:28:17.480]   if you're not getting somewhat close to failure.
[03:28:17.480 --> 03:28:19.600]   Again, it doesn't need to be complete failure.
[03:28:19.600 --> 03:28:22.740]   A good number to think about is like minus two,
[03:28:22.740 --> 03:28:24.780]   which is what we call reps and reserve,
[03:28:24.780 --> 03:28:28.140]   which is sort of like I got within two or so reps of failure
[03:28:28.140 --> 03:28:28.980]   and then I stopped.
[03:28:28.980 --> 03:28:30.380]   - And can we define failure,
[03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:32.900]   at least for sake of this portion of the conversation,
[03:28:32.900 --> 03:28:37.900]   as the point at which you can no longer move the resistance,
[03:28:37.900 --> 03:28:42.460]   could be your body, could be a weight, a machine, et cetera,
[03:28:42.460 --> 03:28:47.460]   that you can no longer move the resistance any more
[03:28:47.460 --> 03:28:51.560]   in the concentric phase of the exercise movement
[03:28:51.560 --> 03:28:52.620]   in good form.
[03:28:52.620 --> 03:28:53.680]   - Correct, but that's a really nice,
[03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:56.440]   momentary muscular failure is how we typically define it.
[03:28:56.440 --> 03:28:58.860]   There's a wonderful review, I think it's open access,
[03:28:58.860 --> 03:29:01.680]   that just came out in the last handful of months.
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:03.400]   Eric Helms's team out of New Zealand.
[03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:05.520]   Eric is a great scientist
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:07.560]   and a very experienced physique coach
[03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:08.460]   and a competitor himself.
[03:29:08.460 --> 03:29:10.600]   So he knows a lot about this area.
[03:29:10.600 --> 03:29:13.600]   And that paper went through all the exact definitions
[03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:15.880]   in detail, all the caveats
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:17.240]   that we're not gonna have time to get into today.
[03:29:17.240 --> 03:29:18.940]   So I would recommend folks like check that out
[03:29:18.940 --> 03:29:20.220]   if they want more information,
[03:29:20.220 --> 03:29:22.900]   but I'll try to get to the highlights of it right here.
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:26.120]   So what they basically showed is going all the way
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:29.640]   to failure in the defining failure like you just did, right?
[03:29:29.640 --> 03:29:32.160]   So momentary muscular failure,
[03:29:32.160 --> 03:29:34.460]   you can't complete another repetition
[03:29:34.460 --> 03:29:36.160]   through a complete range of motion,
[03:29:36.160 --> 03:29:39.080]   through whatever range of motion you determined prior to,
[03:29:39.080 --> 03:29:40.620]   as well as with good technique.
[03:29:40.620 --> 03:29:42.480]   So other body parts aren't being compromised,
[03:29:42.480 --> 03:29:43.560]   sort of et cetera.
[03:29:43.560 --> 03:29:46.980]   And doesn't need to be total failure, that minus two.
[03:29:46.980 --> 03:29:51.000]   Failure is still needed in caveat two,
[03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:54.180]   which is again, very, very highly trained individuals.
[03:29:54.180 --> 03:29:56.320]   You won't see people who are like Eric
[03:29:56.320 --> 03:29:58.780]   or other folks who are six to eight to 10 years
[03:29:58.780 --> 03:30:02.980]   into very serious training who don't have to go to failure
[03:30:02.980 --> 03:30:05.440]   probably a little bit more than what I just said.
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:08.460]   So the layout that they brought in their paper
[03:30:08.460 --> 03:30:09.300]   was very nice.
[03:30:09.300 --> 03:30:10.120]   And they basically said, okay,
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:12.940]   here's a couple of scenarios in which going to failure
[03:30:12.940 --> 03:30:14.860]   is maybe the best way to do it.
[03:30:14.860 --> 03:30:17.640]   Number one, you probably should do it
[03:30:17.640 --> 03:30:20.320]   on a little bit of the safer exercises.
[03:30:20.320 --> 03:30:23.500]   So maybe taking your back squat on a barbell
[03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:26.540]   to complete failure and doing that as like a standard
[03:30:26.540 --> 03:30:27.780]   protocol multiple times a week,
[03:30:27.780 --> 03:30:30.100]   it's maybe not the best choice.
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:32.860]   So maybe if you're gonna do barbell back squats,
[03:30:32.860 --> 03:30:37.440]   you take that to your one or two reps in reserve,
[03:30:37.440 --> 03:30:39.020]   stop there, it's a lot of work.
[03:30:39.020 --> 03:30:41.140]   And actually going back to our discussion
[03:30:41.140 --> 03:30:43.460]   of the purlipin chart, it's a similar idea, right?
[03:30:43.460 --> 03:30:44.980]   Where you're gonna spend most of your time
[03:30:44.980 --> 03:30:48.420]   in these working sets, 70 to 90 sort of percent.
[03:30:48.420 --> 03:30:49.780]   And then you're gonna take that failure
[03:30:49.780 --> 03:30:51.660]   to maybe the hack squat machine,
[03:30:51.660 --> 03:30:53.360]   or maybe even to the leg extension machine.
[03:30:53.360 --> 03:30:55.060]   So a little bit of a safer exercise.
[03:30:55.060 --> 03:30:57.420]   They also can tend to be single joint exercises,
[03:30:57.420 --> 03:30:59.440]   don't have to be, but they're just ones
[03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:01.980]   that are not as complicated and you're not likely
[03:31:01.980 --> 03:31:05.700]   to injure other body parts when you're doing it, all right?
[03:31:05.700 --> 03:31:08.300]   So that's one way to go about it.
[03:31:08.300 --> 03:31:10.380]   Another way to go about it is simply doing it
[03:31:10.380 --> 03:31:13.720]   on like the last movement of the day, right?
[03:31:13.720 --> 03:31:14.900]   And so again, you're not gonna do it
[03:31:14.900 --> 03:31:16.540]   on your first three or four exercises,
[03:31:16.540 --> 03:31:18.460]   but whatever your last finisher is,
[03:31:18.460 --> 03:31:20.580]   you'll hit total failure on that one.
[03:31:20.580 --> 03:31:23.220]   And that kind of keeps you in a range of,
[03:31:23.220 --> 03:31:24.600]   yeah, you hit some failure.
[03:31:24.600 --> 03:31:26.420]   You got a lot of overall work done.
[03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:27.660]   So that's a lot of stimulus.
[03:31:27.660 --> 03:31:29.860]   That's a lot of noise going to that nucleus
[03:31:29.860 --> 03:31:31.600]   that says grow, grow, grow, grow, grow,
[03:31:31.600 --> 03:31:34.820]   but you didn't totally obliterate yourself,
[03:31:34.820 --> 03:31:36.600]   especially if you don't have the assistance
[03:31:36.600 --> 03:31:38.460]   of anabolic steroids, right?
[03:31:38.460 --> 03:31:39.580]   That's very, very important.
[03:31:39.580 --> 03:31:41.620]   If you have those, you can push this a lot harder
[03:31:41.620 --> 03:31:43.660]   'cause your recovery would be significantly enhanced.
[03:31:43.660 --> 03:31:46.060]   If not, you kind of wanna walk away from that.
[03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:49.020]   - I have to assume that 99% of people listening to this
[03:31:49.020 --> 03:31:54.020]   do not, and yet among those who are not taking anything
[03:31:54.020 --> 03:31:58.080]   in terms of anabolic, I think there's a large range
[03:31:58.080 --> 03:32:00.060]   of recovery quotients out there.
[03:32:00.060 --> 03:32:01.700]   Some people just tend to recover better.
[03:32:01.700 --> 03:32:03.820]   Some people I think also are far more diligent
[03:32:03.820 --> 03:32:06.980]   about what I would call the necessary
[03:32:06.980 --> 03:32:09.900]   but not sufficient variables of adequate sleep,
[03:32:09.900 --> 03:32:15.440]   proper nutrition, limiting stress, and so on.
[03:32:15.440 --> 03:32:17.200]   - Yeah, I can't wait to break all that stuff down.
[03:32:17.200 --> 03:32:19.500]   I've got a whole, I've got a very long discussion
[03:32:19.500 --> 03:32:20.340]   for all those things.
[03:32:20.340 --> 03:32:24.060]   - We will get into it in all its practical realities
[03:32:24.060 --> 03:32:27.140]   and actionables before long.
[03:32:27.140 --> 03:32:28.880]   What about rest between sets?
[03:32:28.880 --> 03:32:30.820]   - Great, this is the interplay now.
[03:32:30.820 --> 03:32:32.900]   So one actually thing we said for a long time
[03:32:32.900 --> 03:32:36.260]   is you wanna stick between 30 to 90 seconds of rest
[03:32:36.260 --> 03:32:38.340]   between sets of hypertrophy.
[03:32:38.340 --> 03:32:42.380]   And that's because you're trying to activate
[03:32:42.380 --> 03:32:45.300]   this metabolic disturbance or disruption.
[03:32:45.300 --> 03:32:46.520]   You'd need a little bit of a burn,
[03:32:46.520 --> 03:32:48.080]   a little bit of a pump to go there.
[03:32:48.080 --> 03:32:49.600]   More recent research, a lot of these
[03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:52.280]   out of Brad Schoenfeld's lab and others have shown
[03:32:52.280 --> 03:32:53.900]   that that's just doesn't seem to be the case.
[03:32:53.900 --> 03:32:58.680]   Again, for moderate to newly trained individuals,
[03:32:58.680 --> 03:33:01.060]   whether that's the case for the highly trained folks,
[03:33:01.060 --> 03:33:03.040]   I don't necessarily know.
[03:33:03.040 --> 03:33:04.800]   I don't think there's any difference here.
[03:33:04.800 --> 03:33:06.940]   So you can take up to three to five minutes
[03:33:06.940 --> 03:33:09.440]   of rest in between sets and be fine.
[03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:11.360]   The caveat here though is this.
[03:33:11.360 --> 03:33:13.760]   If you're gonna rest longer,
[03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:17.220]   that means the metabolic challenge is lower.
[03:33:17.220 --> 03:33:19.620]   So you need to then increase the challenge
[03:33:19.620 --> 03:33:21.260]   in either mechanical tension,
[03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:25.660]   which think about as weight, load or muscle breakdown.
[03:33:25.660 --> 03:33:28.020]   So you can't lower one of the variables,
[03:33:28.020 --> 03:33:30.280]   keep everything else the same and expect the same result.
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:32.380]   So if you're going to have more rest,
[03:33:32.380 --> 03:33:36.260]   then you need to either preserve the load on your bar
[03:33:36.260 --> 03:33:37.540]   or the volume.
[03:33:37.540 --> 03:33:38.940]   One of the two has to happen.
[03:33:38.940 --> 03:33:41.100]   So this gives people a lot of opportunity.
[03:33:41.100 --> 03:33:44.640]   I generally tell people if you're gonna train
[03:33:44.640 --> 03:33:46.680]   for hypertrophy, it's probably best to stay
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:49.160]   in the two minute range at most.
[03:33:49.160 --> 03:33:52.640]   You can go longer, but a lot of people have a hard time
[03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:55.120]   actually coming back and then executing that next set
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:33:57.680]   with enough intent to get there
[03:33:57.680 --> 03:34:00.840]   and or it's going to make your workouts tremendously long.
[03:34:00.840 --> 03:34:03.240]   So you can stick to the shorter one.
[03:34:03.240 --> 03:34:06.120]   You don't have as much mechanical tension, but that's okay.
[03:34:06.120 --> 03:34:06.960]   You can still get there.
[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:10.560]   But in reality of it is you can do whatever you would like.
[03:34:10.560 --> 03:34:12.660]   Tell me if this is a reasonable structure
[03:34:12.660 --> 03:34:14.760]   given what you've told us.
[03:34:14.760 --> 03:34:16.580]   Three exercises per muscle group.
[03:34:16.580 --> 03:34:20.760]   First exercise, slightly heavier loads.
[03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:22.940]   So repetition ranges somewhere between,
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:26.460]   let's say five and eight with perhaps hitting failure
[03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:29.120]   or close to it on the last set.
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:32.020]   Rest periods of somewhere between two
[03:34:32.020 --> 03:34:35.020]   or let's get wild and say five minutes, okay?
[03:34:35.020 --> 03:34:37.500]   So it's a little bit more of a strength type workout
[03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:40.080]   at that point, but then moving to a second exercise
[03:34:40.080 --> 03:34:43.040]   of three or four sets where the repetition range
[03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:46.200]   is now eight to 15.
[03:34:46.200 --> 03:34:49.640]   Shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so.
[03:34:49.640 --> 03:34:51.440]   And then on the third exercise,
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:56.400]   repetition ranges of 12 to 30.
[03:34:56.400 --> 03:34:59.280]   This number 30 kind of makes me wide-eyed.
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:01.080]   I can't remember the last time I did a set of 30
[03:35:01.080 --> 03:35:02.480]   thinking it was for hypertrophy,
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:04.640]   but what you're saying makes absolute sense
[03:35:04.640 --> 03:35:05.960]   and is research back.
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:10.960]   So very short rest intervals, maybe 30 seconds
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:13.400]   between sets.
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:17.640]   Would that allow somebody to target all three forms
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:19.320]   of major adaptation?
[03:35:19.320 --> 03:35:21.400]   I mean, in my mind, it works.
[03:35:21.400 --> 03:35:23.080]   You're talking about mechanical loads,
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:24.880]   you're talking about stress and damage,
[03:35:24.880 --> 03:35:27.580]   and you're talking about metabolic stress.
[03:35:27.580 --> 03:35:30.440]   Is that better than to, for instance,
[03:35:30.440 --> 03:35:34.600]   do all the high repetition work in one workout per week
[03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:37.800]   and then higher loads in the other workout?
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:40.480]   Does it matter if you divide them up or combine them?
[03:35:40.480 --> 03:35:42.000]   - It would not matter.
[03:35:42.000 --> 03:35:44.000]   I would say it matters in the sense
[03:35:44.000 --> 03:35:46.440]   of your personal practical situation.
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:47.920]   - Well, long rest, for me,
[03:35:47.920 --> 03:35:51.400]   I love training heavier with longer rest,
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:54.440]   but I'm hearing that there's real value
[03:35:54.440 --> 03:35:56.920]   to doing these higher repetition ranges.
[03:35:56.920 --> 03:36:00.520]   - So the formula you set up there in a second is great.
[03:36:00.520 --> 03:36:03.160]   If you wanna do it the other way, that's fine.
[03:36:03.160 --> 03:36:04.680]   It's kind of idiot-proof.
[03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:06.520]   You can set this up however you'd like.
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:08.280]   You could actually do the inverse.
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:11.440]   Theoretically, you could do the sets of 30 first
[03:36:11.440 --> 03:36:13.140]   and then move to your sets of 80.
[03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:15.800]   It doesn't really matter because we're trying
[03:36:15.800 --> 03:36:18.040]   to just get to a certain total stimuli
[03:36:18.040 --> 03:36:19.320]   and you're gonna hit it eventually.
[03:36:19.320 --> 03:36:21.720]   So you have a lot of room to play here.
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:23.400]   You also have a lot of room to adapt
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:25.240]   based on your circumstances.
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:27.240]   God, I'm short on time today.
[03:36:27.240 --> 03:36:29.120]   Typically, my workout takes me 60 minutes
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:30.040]   for this plan I have.
[03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:31.920]   I've only got 35 today.
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:33.400]   What do I do?
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:35.860]   Well, if you're training for strength,
[03:36:35.860 --> 03:36:37.640]   that's a different answer
[03:36:37.640 --> 03:36:38.820]   than if you're training for hypertrophy.
[03:36:38.820 --> 03:36:40.600]   If you're training for hypertrophy,
[03:36:40.600 --> 03:36:42.800]   you need to make sure you hit that total volume.
[03:36:42.800 --> 03:36:45.160]   So in this particular case, lower the load,
[03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:48.160]   lower the rest intervals, and just get to the burn
[03:36:48.160 --> 03:36:49.600]   and get going as much as you can.
[03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:51.240]   If you're training for strength,
[03:36:51.240 --> 03:36:54.180]   I would rather you cut your volume in half.
[03:36:54.180 --> 03:36:56.880]   Get those few repetitions done at that high load
[03:36:56.880 --> 03:36:59.220]   and just don't do very many sets today.
[03:36:59.220 --> 03:37:00.400]   That's a better result.
[03:37:00.400 --> 03:37:02.940]   So the goal that you're going after
[03:37:02.940 --> 03:37:05.880]   is going to determine what we call chaos management,
[03:37:05.880 --> 03:37:07.680]   which is that thing like that,
[03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:09.420]   running out of time today, my time is short,
[03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:11.240]   or you don't even think my time is short,
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:13.080]   something got cut off, I'm not feeling it today,
[03:37:13.080 --> 03:37:15.480]   I'm in a hotel, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
[03:37:15.480 --> 03:37:16.400]   which is life, right?
[03:37:16.400 --> 03:37:19.320]   That's gonna be 10 to 50% of your workouts
[03:37:19.320 --> 03:37:21.040]   is gonna be chaos management.
[03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:23.600]   Well, how you make those decisions
[03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:25.740]   is gonna go back to understanding, number one,
[03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:27.720]   what goal you're going after, and then number two,
[03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:29.560]   what are the physiological consequences,
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:31.760]   we call these physiological limiters,
[03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:33.840]   for each one, and that's gonna tell you
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.440]   what to select and prioritize,
[03:37:35.440 --> 03:37:38.480]   the volume, the intensity, or whatever else.
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:42.880]   - I'd like to ask about frequency,
[03:37:42.880 --> 03:37:45.920]   but I'd like to frame it a little bit differently
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:47.640]   than that.
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:50.360]   I'd like to ask about total workout duration,
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:52.200]   which dovetails with frequency,
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:56.400]   because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:00.000]   per week, and one is combining different muscle groups
[03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:02.920]   on the same days, well then workouts are going to be
[03:38:02.920 --> 03:38:05.160]   a very different duration than if one is doing
[03:38:05.160 --> 03:38:07.680]   a different body part each day, for instance.
[03:38:07.680 --> 03:38:10.500]   And so I feel like any discussion about frequency
[03:38:10.500 --> 03:38:13.160]   has to be within the context of workout duration,
[03:38:13.160 --> 03:38:14.200]   and vice versa.
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:18.200]   - Yeah, if you are a lifting junkie,
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:20.040]   and you're very consistent in your schedule,
[03:38:20.040 --> 03:38:21.580]   I'm actually okay with body parts,
[03:38:21.580 --> 03:38:24.240]   but most people are not that.
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:27.000]   And so the concern there is, if you say are isolating
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:30.040]   and waiting to do your glutes on one day of the week,
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:32.640]   and something happens on that day,
[03:38:32.640 --> 03:38:35.140]   you might go another 13 days now,
[03:38:35.140 --> 03:38:36.940]   before training, between workouts.
[03:38:36.940 --> 03:38:38.560]   And that's really difficult to maintain.
[03:38:38.560 --> 03:38:40.240]   The frequency won't be high enough,
[03:38:40.240 --> 03:38:43.600]   unless the load and volume on that one day
[03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:45.520]   is astronomically high.
[03:38:45.520 --> 03:38:47.080]   It's just not gonna happen.
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:49.500]   So while if you look at the research,
[03:38:49.500 --> 03:38:52.140]   frequency, in terms of how many days per week,
[03:38:52.140 --> 03:38:54.920]   doesn't matter that much, as long as the total load
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:38:57.260]   and failure are equivalent.
[03:38:57.260 --> 03:38:59.820]   Practically, it's a challenge.
[03:38:59.820 --> 03:39:04.360]   So it's hard because life gets in the way for most people,
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:05.960]   especially if you have kids, and a job,
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:07.140]   and all these things over there.
[03:39:07.140 --> 03:39:09.700]   So I actually prefer doing something more like
[03:39:09.700 --> 03:39:11.980]   three days a week of total body.
[03:39:11.980 --> 03:39:14.180]   And if something happens, you've just missed
[03:39:14.180 --> 03:39:17.180]   that body part for 48 hours, 72 hours.
[03:39:17.180 --> 03:39:18.760]   I like that a little better for most people,
[03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:20.400]   not because it's more effective,
[03:39:20.400 --> 03:39:24.520]   but just because it's a little bit more resilient to life,
[03:39:24.520 --> 03:39:25.660]   and you can get there.
[03:39:25.660 --> 03:39:27.800]   If you wanted to actually do a little bit of a combination,
[03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:30.400]   so if you wanted to do like two days a week of whole body,
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:31.760]   and then two days a week of a little bit
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:34.560]   of a body part split, then you're actually sort of hedging
[03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:36.720]   against all risks there.
[03:39:36.720 --> 03:39:39.160]   As long as you get to that total number there.
[03:39:39.160 --> 03:39:42.000]   Now, there is actually some evidence in a couple of ways
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:43.920]   that maybe a little bit more frequently
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:45.060]   is a little bit better.
[03:39:45.060 --> 03:39:46.520]   But the difficulty is now going back
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:47.940]   to the practicality question of like,
[03:39:47.940 --> 03:39:51.580]   how many people really can train just their strength training
[03:39:51.580 --> 03:39:52.980]   six days a week?
[03:39:52.980 --> 03:39:55.360]   Wow, that doesn't count any of their long duration stuff,
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:58.160]   it doesn't, their high heart rate, their flexibility.
[03:39:58.160 --> 03:39:59.940]   Okay, it's just really, really, really hard
[03:39:59.940 --> 03:40:01.180]   to get all that stuff in.
[03:40:01.180 --> 03:40:03.880]   So it is, it tends to be easier on folks
[03:40:03.880 --> 03:40:07.580]   in terms of execution and long-term adherence,
[03:40:07.580 --> 03:40:11.100]   in my opinion, to get that volume accomplished
[03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:13.860]   in a little bit more frequent patterns,
[03:40:13.860 --> 03:40:15.460]   but not once a week.
[03:40:15.460 --> 03:40:17.420]   So I like to kind of have it right there
[03:40:17.420 --> 03:40:20.700]   for most people, again, not because it is technically
[03:40:20.700 --> 03:40:22.040]   quote, unquote, more effective,
[03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:26.520]   but because you're less likely to fail to progress
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:29.400]   because of skipping a workout, something popping up,
[03:40:29.400 --> 03:40:33.000]   your power going out and your garage door being locked
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:34.160]   on you or whatever.
[03:40:34.160 --> 03:40:36.200]   - Imagine that, that happened to me this morning, folks.
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:37.360]   Couldn't get out of my driveway
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:41.000]   'cause the gate, the electronic gate was down
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:41.960]   because the power was down.
[03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:43.960]   Anyway, solve that problem.
[03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:46.320]   The way you describe it, my sense is that workouts
[03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:50.560]   will last somewhere between one and two hours of real work.
[03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:51.400]   Is that about right?
[03:40:51.400 --> 03:40:53.240]   - It doesn't have to be nearly that long.
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:54.260]   I mean, you could certainly get enough
[03:40:54.260 --> 03:40:55.940]   to work done in 30 minutes.
[03:40:55.940 --> 03:40:57.600]   - Even a whole body workout.
[03:40:57.600 --> 03:40:58.840]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:01.120]   So if you're doing that three days a week,
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:02.840]   so remember the numbers we're trying to hit here.
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:04.600]   Let's say we're trying to hit 15 working sets
[03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:06.040]   per muscle group per week.
[03:41:06.040 --> 03:41:09.160]   That's five working sets per day for muscle groups.
[03:41:09.160 --> 03:41:11.080]   So if you did one exercise for that day,
[03:41:11.080 --> 03:41:13.200]   let's say you did squats, you did five sets,
[03:41:13.200 --> 03:41:14.380]   you did that three days a week, you're done.
[03:41:14.380 --> 03:41:15.800]   There's your 15.
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:17.720]   - But there are other muscle groups to hit
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:19.060]   on the same day you're doing squats
[03:41:19.060 --> 03:41:20.480]   if you're doing whole body.
[03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:22.120]   - Yeah, so you've gotten them all ready.
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:25.440]   And so like all the leg muscles in that example
[03:41:25.440 --> 03:41:26.960]   are taken care of.
[03:41:26.960 --> 03:41:29.120]   - So you would not do separate hamstring work necessarily?
[03:41:29.120 --> 03:41:30.080]   - You wouldn't need to.
[03:41:30.080 --> 03:41:32.280]   Now, hamstrings is actually a little bit of a caveat.
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:35.300]   Like that's a good example of an exercise or a muscle group.
[03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:37.400]   That's probably really good to make sure you isolate.
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:40.860]   It's challenging to get with your standard deadlift
[03:41:40.860 --> 03:41:42.120]   and squat.
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:44.400]   It's one of the probably ones that's most important
[03:41:44.400 --> 03:41:46.160]   to go target outside of that.
[03:41:46.160 --> 03:41:48.160]   But in theoretically though, outside of that,
[03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:50.640]   you would get most of your leg muscles done
[03:41:50.640 --> 03:41:52.000]   with even a single exercise.
[03:41:52.000 --> 03:41:53.360]   And even if you wanted to change it up.
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:54.960]   So you said, all right, Monday,
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:57.360]   I'm gonna do a squat variation.
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:41:58.840]   Wednesday, the next day lift,
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:02.380]   I'm gonna do some sort of deadlift hinging variation.
[03:42:02.380 --> 03:42:04.080]   And then maybe Friday, my third day,
[03:42:04.080 --> 03:42:06.640]   I'm gonna do some sort of unilateral,
[03:42:06.640 --> 03:42:10.040]   maybe rear foot elevated split squat or something like that.
[03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:12.040]   All right, maybe even a lateral lunge,
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:13.360]   maybe a different plane.
[03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:14.640]   Okay, you're in a pretty good spot.
[03:42:14.640 --> 03:42:16.880]   You're gonna hit most of those muscles
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:19.600]   to your 15 working sets,
[03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:22.200]   especially if you take sort of that last set each day.
[03:42:22.200 --> 03:42:23.840]   It's a pretty close to failure.
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:25.680]   That's gonna get some more serious work done,
[03:42:25.680 --> 03:42:26.720]   but you're not gonna be so fatigued.
[03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:29.280]   You can't come back and train it a couple of days later
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:30.240]   and you'll be fine.
[03:42:30.240 --> 03:42:32.960]   So you could even split that up into two days a week.
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:34.060]   And now all you really have to do
[03:42:34.060 --> 03:42:35.900]   is hit something like seven working sets.
[03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:38.400]   So maybe that's two exercises per day,
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:41.040]   maybe some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge,
[03:42:42.040 --> 03:42:44.480]   you know, three to four sets each.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:46.840]   You're gonna hit six to eight sets that day.
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:47.680]   You did that three days a week.
[03:42:47.680 --> 03:42:50.280]   Now all of a sudden you're at that 20, 24 sets,
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:51.120]   body being a bit of a boom.
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:51.960]   Same thing with the upper body.
[03:42:51.960 --> 03:42:53.160]   I just gave lower body examples
[03:42:53.160 --> 03:42:55.280]   'cause, you know, I like the lower body more.
[03:42:55.280 --> 03:42:59.020]   So it's not that challenging to get to those numbers
[03:42:59.020 --> 03:43:01.200]   and split, and those workouts can be extremely short.
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:04.140]   So if you were doing that three days a week,
[03:43:04.140 --> 03:43:06.960]   you know, you're doing that one exercise upper body,
[03:43:06.960 --> 03:43:08.000]   one exercise lower body,
[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.360]   that certainly shouldn't take more than 40 minutes.
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:14.480]   - I'm happy to hear that, not because I don't like training.
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:17.380]   Please excuse the double negative.
[03:43:17.380 --> 03:43:20.120]   But I've found that resistance training workouts
[03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:22.320]   that extend longer than one hour of work
[03:43:22.320 --> 03:43:24.180]   and certainly longer than 75 minutes of work
[03:43:24.180 --> 03:43:25.480]   leave me very fatigued.
[03:43:25.480 --> 03:43:26.320]   - Oh, sure.
[03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:28.520]   - And fatigued to the point where concentrating
[03:43:28.520 --> 03:43:32.000]   on cognitive work throughout the day can be challenging,
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:33.680]   need a longer nap in the afternoon.
[03:43:33.680 --> 03:43:36.000]   I'm a big proponent of naps in the afternoon in any case,
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:39.420]   but requiring longer naps in the afternoon, et cetera.
[03:43:39.420 --> 03:43:41.380]   So at least for me,
[03:43:41.380 --> 03:43:43.440]   restricting the resistance training workouts
[03:43:43.440 --> 03:43:48.440]   to about 50, five, zero to 60 minutes of real work,
[03:43:48.440 --> 03:43:50.220]   for me three or four times per week,
[03:43:50.220 --> 03:43:51.840]   has helped tremendously.
[03:43:51.840 --> 03:43:54.980]   So it's a case where doing higher intensity work
[03:43:54.980 --> 03:43:56.640]   in a shorter period of time
[03:43:56.640 --> 03:43:59.160]   and actually hitting muscle groups less frequently,
[03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:02.180]   for me that's, again, once directly, once indirectly,
[03:44:02.180 --> 03:44:03.920]   has worked really well.
[03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:05.580]   And as you mentioned earlier,
[03:44:05.580 --> 03:44:07.620]   this could very well be explained
[03:44:07.620 --> 03:44:09.840]   by not my recovery quotient
[03:44:09.840 --> 03:44:12.680]   as some sort of a genetic or physiological variable,
[03:44:12.680 --> 03:44:14.100]   but the way that I'm training.
[03:44:14.100 --> 03:44:16.640]   And indeed, I like to do a few forced reps
[03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:18.100]   and go to failure on too many sets.
[03:44:18.100 --> 03:44:21.440]   And you know, I weaned in that genre of training.
[03:44:21.440 --> 03:44:23.560]   - It's also fun, like to just train hard.
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:24.520]   - It is. - It's really fun.
[03:44:24.520 --> 03:44:26.640]   - It is, I think that I've learned a lot
[03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:28.680]   by training to quote unquote to failure.
[03:44:28.680 --> 03:44:29.520]   - Of course.
[03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:31.200]   - I think there's a lot of learning in there
[03:44:31.200 --> 03:44:32.540]   provided it's done safely.
[03:44:32.540 --> 03:44:34.680]   But what you're describing actually inspires me
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:37.560]   to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits
[03:44:37.560 --> 03:44:39.840]   and ways of training for hypertrophy and strength.
[03:44:39.840 --> 03:44:41.780]   Because this notion of not necessarily
[03:44:41.780 --> 03:44:43.300]   having to go to failure
[03:44:43.300 --> 03:44:44.960]   and still being able to evoke strength
[03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:49.960]   and hypertrophy adaptations is a really intriguing one,
[03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:51.900]   dare I even say a seductive one.
[03:44:51.900 --> 03:44:56.500]   And that leads me to a question that is based on findings
[03:44:56.500 --> 03:44:58.680]   that I've heard discussed on social media,
[03:44:58.680 --> 03:45:00.640]   which means very little, if anything,
[03:45:00.640 --> 03:45:02.840]   unless it's in the context of people
[03:45:02.840 --> 03:45:05.480]   who really know exercise science
[03:45:05.480 --> 03:45:07.120]   and you're one such person.
[03:45:07.120 --> 03:45:11.720]   And that's this idea that because resistance training
[03:45:11.720 --> 03:45:14.840]   can evoke a protein synthesis adaptation response,
[03:45:14.840 --> 03:45:21.560]   but that adaptation response is lasts about 48 hours
[03:45:21.560 --> 03:45:23.760]   before it starts to taper off,
[03:45:23.760 --> 03:45:27.280]   that the ideal in quotes frequency for training
[03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:31.560]   a given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours.
[03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:32.920]   Is that true?
[03:45:32.920 --> 03:45:33.940]   - Yes and no.
[03:45:33.940 --> 03:45:36.140]   So a couple of things there.
[03:45:36.140 --> 03:45:37.780]   Remember in order to grow a muscle,
[03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:38.940]   there's multiple steps here.
[03:45:38.940 --> 03:45:40.320]   So you have the signaling response,
[03:45:40.320 --> 03:45:43.100]   which actually happens within seconds of exercise
[03:45:43.100 --> 03:45:45.200]   and can last depending on the marker,
[03:45:45.200 --> 03:45:46.860]   up to an hour or two hours.
[03:45:46.860 --> 03:45:49.540]   Step number two then is gene expression.
[03:45:49.540 --> 03:45:51.500]   And when we see that that's typically peaked
[03:45:51.500 --> 03:45:53.900]   around two to six hours post exercise.
[03:45:53.900 --> 03:45:56.340]   And then you have following that protein synthesis.
[03:45:56.340 --> 03:45:58.460]   And that's that longer timeframe,
[03:45:58.460 --> 03:46:00.960]   somewhere between 12 hours there.
[03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:03.180]   It's certainly not peaked for 48 hours.
[03:46:03.180 --> 03:46:05.300]   It may be still there 48 hours from now,
[03:46:05.300 --> 03:46:08.040]   but it is absolutely coming down at that point,
[03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:10.000]   depending on sort of a number of factors.
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:11.480]   So that part of it is sort of true.
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:13.760]   So this is a combination of like some half truths
[03:46:13.760 --> 03:46:16.280]   and some like maybe just pedantic things
[03:46:16.280 --> 03:46:18.640]   that aren't really that important to differentiate.
[03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:21.720]   The real question I think is like, okay,
[03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:24.040]   is it okay to train sooner slash is it better
[03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:27.600]   to train sooner or actually is it better to wait longer?
[03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:30.520]   There's no real reason to think that you need to train
[03:46:30.520 --> 03:46:32.560]   if the goal is hypertrophy,
[03:46:32.560 --> 03:46:34.920]   any sooner than 48 hours afterwards.
[03:46:34.920 --> 03:46:38.820]   I can't think of an advantage that that would confer.
[03:46:38.820 --> 03:46:43.040]   I also can't think of any practical applications,
[03:46:43.040 --> 03:46:46.100]   athletes, physique, bodybuilders, coaches
[03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:48.580]   that ever found tremendous success doing that.
[03:46:48.580 --> 03:46:53.120]   So I would be very skeptical that that is any way better.
[03:46:53.120 --> 03:46:55.900]   Now, could you do it in some instances of say,
[03:46:55.900 --> 03:46:57.900]   you know, you've got travel coming up like that
[03:46:57.900 --> 03:46:58.740]   so that you just, yeah.
[03:46:58.740 --> 03:47:02.000]   - You wanna preload the system by destroying the muscle.
[03:47:02.000 --> 03:47:02.840]   - No problem.
[03:47:02.840 --> 03:47:04.960]   - Waiting seven days or 14 days.
[03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:06.520]   I've known people who have done that before.
[03:47:06.520 --> 03:47:08.080]   - I do all the time. - Vacations or layoffs.
[03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:09.400]   - Every time, like every single time.
[03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:11.920]   - So annihilate themselves and then take a two week layoff.
[03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:13.480]   - Yeah, and it's like, there's no benefit there
[03:47:13.480 --> 03:47:15.940]   other than psychological, like I just love it.
[03:47:15.940 --> 03:47:17.400]   Like it feels great to be super sore.
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:19.460]   I feel less crappy not training for those couple of days.
[03:47:19.460 --> 03:47:20.600]   'Cause I'm like, oh, I'm super sore anyways.
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:22.600]   - You need the extended rest.
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:23.520]   - Yeah, of course.
[03:47:23.520 --> 03:47:27.160]   And it's just like, it's just a crappy justification
[03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:31.240]   in my brain that like, excuse to do something really wild
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:32.940]   and that I totally don't need and get way sore
[03:47:32.940 --> 03:47:33.780]   that I should get.
[03:47:33.780 --> 03:47:36.120]   - Dr. Andy Galvin's suggestions of what not to do,
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:38.260]   but that he does.
[03:47:38.260 --> 03:47:39.240]   - Yeah, 100%.
[03:47:39.240 --> 03:47:40.660]   - Do as I say, not as I do.
[03:47:40.660 --> 03:47:42.400]   The famous words of every research professor.
[03:47:42.400 --> 03:47:46.560]   - Yeah, I think 48 hours is a reasonable time to wait.
[03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:48.300]   Can't think of any advantage of going sooner than that.
[03:47:48.300 --> 03:47:50.040]   There's really not a tremendous amount of advantage
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:51.280]   of waiting much longer than that.
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:53.640]   Certainly 72 hours is fine.
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:56.380]   As long as you're hitting these concepts we've talked about,
[03:47:56.380 --> 03:47:59.880]   you can let really life determine that.
[03:47:59.880 --> 03:48:01.720]   - I mean, there's situations too with like,
[03:48:01.720 --> 03:48:04.520]   particularly our athletes where we have to kind of break
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:06.440]   that because of schedule obligations.
[03:48:06.440 --> 03:48:08.960]   So they're playing every fifth day, every third day
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:09.800]   or something like that.
[03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:11.800]   You're just gonna have to lift them back to back days
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:13.840]   and you're just gonna have to get it done.
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:16.140]   But yeah, I can't think of why I'd go out of my way
[03:48:16.140 --> 03:48:17.200]   to do that.
[03:48:17.200 --> 03:48:20.540]   - The second part of that question is,
[03:48:20.540 --> 03:48:25.220]   let's say somebody trains a muscle, they train it properly.
[03:48:25.220 --> 03:48:26.800]   They hit it in the appropriate rep ranges
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:30.260]   and appropriate rest, et cetera, that the stimulus is there.
[03:48:30.260 --> 03:48:31.740]   The adaptation is set in motion.
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:36.680]   They're getting somewhere at 48 hours or so,
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:40.600]   a protein synthesis peak that's gonna taper off.
[03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:43.840]   But they don't train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later.
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.720]   They train it five or six days later.
[03:48:45.720 --> 03:48:49.520]   Not because they're lazy, not because they don't care,
[03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:52.920]   but because they have other priorities that are woven in
[03:48:52.920 --> 03:48:55.880]   with getting hypertrophy in this muscle.
[03:48:55.880 --> 03:48:57.880]   There are people who exist only to get hypertrophy
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:48:59.480]   in a given muscle group, but let's be fair.
[03:48:59.480 --> 03:49:02.720]   Most people would like to grow that muscle group,
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:05.680]   but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle
[03:49:05.680 --> 03:49:08.720]   starts to revert to its pre-hypertrophic state?
[03:49:08.720 --> 03:49:10.840]   That is, does it atrophy and get smaller again?
[03:49:10.840 --> 03:49:13.440]   Because if it doesn't, I could see a lot of reasons
[03:49:13.440 --> 03:49:15.100]   for hitting a muscle group once every five days
[03:49:15.100 --> 03:49:18.120]   or seven days, provided you hold on to the hypertrophy
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:20.280]   that you initiated five or seven days ago.
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:22.740]   - Yeah, there's no reason to think you will lose anything
[03:49:22.740 --> 03:49:25.240]   in that sort of a time domain, five to seven days.
[03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:28.220]   The only challenge with training that infrequently
[03:49:28.220 --> 03:49:30.880]   is can you actually get enough total volume done?
[03:49:30.880 --> 03:49:33.440]   So if you're gonna train a muscle once a week,
[03:49:33.440 --> 03:49:36.380]   you either have to go to real failure,
[03:49:36.380 --> 03:49:39.080]   real damage and soreness, or you have to figure out
[03:49:39.080 --> 03:49:41.580]   a way to hit 20 cents that day in that muscle.
[03:49:41.580 --> 03:49:43.600]   Not at all impossible, especially if you're thinking,
[03:49:43.600 --> 03:49:45.340]   well, actually all I have to get is 15,
[03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:48.840]   and I'm gonna do five sets of three exercises.
[03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:51.080]   That's not outrageous, not at all.
[03:49:51.080 --> 03:49:52.440]   So like absolutely possible.
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:54.500]   If you're wanting to go more towards 20,
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:49:56.480]   we're getting closer to that 25.
[03:49:56.480 --> 03:49:58.400]   Like now it starts to get pretty challenging.
[03:49:58.400 --> 03:50:01.700]   So scientifically the research will suggest
[03:50:01.700 --> 03:50:04.040]   it's gonna be equally effective.
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:06.040]   Practically it's challenging for people
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:08.520]   to hit sufficient volume without just being
[03:50:08.520 --> 03:50:11.120]   so demoralized afterwards because they're in so much pain
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:12.480]   they can't get out of their car
[03:50:12.480 --> 03:50:13.720]   'cause their legs are so trashed.
[03:50:13.720 --> 03:50:15.160]   They can't sit in the toilet and get back up
[03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:17.440]   without crying from pain, so.
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:18.280]   - That's not good.
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:19.520]   - No. - That's not good.
[03:50:19.520 --> 03:50:21.160]   - I say that 'cause those are actual examples
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:22.700]   that have happened in my life.
[03:50:22.700 --> 03:50:25.840]   - Yeah, I'm realizing as we're having this conversation
[03:50:25.840 --> 03:50:27.960]   about ways to stimulate hypertrophy
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:31.280]   that I've sort of defaulted to more intensity
[03:50:31.280 --> 03:50:33.280]   as opposed to volume because of the time factor.
[03:50:33.280 --> 03:50:35.140]   I have a lot of other things going on in my life.
[03:50:35.140 --> 03:50:38.600]   And so within that hour, I can't get enough sets
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:40.520]   in across all the muscle groups I need to hit.
[03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:42.700]   And I'm only gonna do it about once a week.
[03:50:42.700 --> 03:50:45.360]   And so it's, at least for me,
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:47.480]   more advantageous to just train extremely hard.
[03:50:47.480 --> 03:50:49.120]   I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique
[03:50:49.120 --> 03:50:50.600]   that you mentioned before,
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:52.740]   or pre-fatigue as you referred to it,
[03:50:52.740 --> 03:50:54.980]   hitting something really strong with an isolation exercise,
[03:50:54.980 --> 03:50:56.920]   then doing compound exercises.
[03:50:56.920 --> 03:51:00.320]   I'm starting to think, based on what you've told me,
[03:51:00.320 --> 03:51:05.000]   that pre-fatigue and then a compound exercise,
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:07.340]   in some ways, it's not really two sets.
[03:51:07.340 --> 03:51:09.800]   Because if you're going to failure, forced reps,
[03:51:09.800 --> 03:51:11.500]   you're kind of pushing past failure,
[03:51:11.500 --> 03:51:13.200]   then you're doing a compound exercise
[03:51:13.200 --> 03:51:15.240]   and you're doing that two or three times.
[03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:18.220]   Well, that sounds like four to six sets,
[03:51:18.220 --> 03:51:21.060]   but the forced repetitions are almost
[03:51:21.060 --> 03:51:22.900]   like an additional set, right?
[03:51:22.900 --> 03:51:23.740]   - Yep.
[03:51:23.740 --> 03:51:25.380]   - And so it's not 20 sets,
[03:51:25.380 --> 03:51:27.920]   but it's four to six really, really hard sets
[03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:30.660]   that go beyond what we normally think of as a set.
[03:51:30.660 --> 03:51:31.500]   - Totally.
[03:51:31.500 --> 03:51:33.560]   - Okay, so the difference between running on concrete
[03:51:33.560 --> 03:51:34.520]   and running on sand.
[03:51:34.520 --> 03:51:37.300]   When I go for a sand run, it's a very different experience.
[03:51:37.300 --> 03:51:38.200]   - Totally, yep.
[03:51:38.200 --> 03:51:40.620]   And this is why, I should have mentioned this
[03:51:40.620 --> 03:51:42.840]   at the very, very beginning of our chat today,
[03:51:42.840 --> 03:51:45.800]   but all of these numbers that I'll give you
[03:51:45.800 --> 03:51:48.860]   for any exercise adaptation, you cannot think
[03:51:48.860 --> 03:51:50.820]   of them as hard lines.
[03:51:50.820 --> 03:51:52.520]   They are gradients.
[03:51:52.520 --> 03:51:55.460]   And so when we think about the number for hypertrophy
[03:51:55.460 --> 03:51:58.180]   in terms of repetitions, I said four to 30.
[03:51:58.180 --> 03:52:00.220]   What do you think happens at three?
[03:52:00.220 --> 03:52:02.180]   Do you think hypertrophy just stops?
[03:52:02.180 --> 03:52:03.620]   In fact, the number you'll see in literature
[03:52:03.620 --> 03:52:04.980]   is more like six to 30.
[03:52:04.980 --> 03:52:06.980]   I actually slide it down to four though,
[03:52:06.980 --> 03:52:08.440]   like personal preference because of that.
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:09.440]   But it just fades away.
[03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:11.700]   What do you think happens at rep 31, 35?
[03:52:11.700 --> 03:52:15.280]   It just fades gradually over time.
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:16.760]   So you actually sort of brought this up
[03:52:16.760 --> 03:52:18.540]   one of your other questions, and I'm not sure
[03:52:18.540 --> 03:52:20.540]   if you were even thinking about this, or maybe you were.
[03:52:20.540 --> 03:52:22.540]   I just babbled on about something else.
[03:52:22.540 --> 03:52:25.960]   But if strength happens between this like one to five
[03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:29.420]   repetition range, and hypertrophy typically happens
[03:52:29.420 --> 03:52:31.500]   in this like eight to 30 range.
[03:52:31.500 --> 03:52:34.020]   What happens if I were to do the sets of six?
[03:52:34.020 --> 03:52:35.300]   Or God forbid, seven.
[03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:36.740]   Like seven and nine are these numbers
[03:52:36.740 --> 03:52:39.060]   you just absolutely don't do in strength training, right?
[03:52:39.060 --> 03:52:41.680]   It's just like sets of one, two, three, four, five, six,
[03:52:41.680 --> 03:52:44.420]   got eight, 10, 12, like do not program a set of 13.
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:46.300]   - Now when I'm training sets of seven to nine.
[03:52:46.300 --> 03:52:48.480]   - Yeah, it's great, right?
[03:52:48.480 --> 03:52:51.060]   We'll use sets of seven a lot with weight lifters
[03:52:51.060 --> 03:52:53.200]   'cause you can actually count numbers more effectively.
[03:52:53.200 --> 03:52:54.740]   - But what happens in seven to nine rep ranges?
[03:52:54.740 --> 03:52:56.940]   - Great, so this is actually a wonderful area
[03:52:56.940 --> 03:53:00.680]   of these like five to eight repetitions
[03:53:00.680 --> 03:53:02.240]   where you're gonna get a nice combination
[03:53:02.240 --> 03:53:05.100]   of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy.
[03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:06.480]   So someone is coming in going,
[03:53:06.480 --> 03:53:10.220]   "Man, I wanna get stronger and I wanna add muscle.
[03:53:10.220 --> 03:53:11.220]   "What do I do here?"
[03:53:11.220 --> 03:53:12.980]   Well, that's actually a really nice answer.
[03:53:12.980 --> 03:53:16.860]   Train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range
[03:53:16.860 --> 03:53:18.060]   and you're gonna get a lot stronger
[03:53:18.060 --> 03:53:20.420]   and you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy.
[03:53:20.420 --> 03:53:23.920]   If you want to really maximize hypertrophy,
[03:53:23.920 --> 03:53:26.000]   I would probably spend most of your time
[03:53:26.000 --> 03:53:30.080]   in the eight to 15 repetition per set range.
[03:53:30.080 --> 03:53:32.540]   You can go up to 30, admittedly though,
[03:53:32.540 --> 03:53:35.000]   I don't think it's optimal to spend most of your time
[03:53:35.000 --> 03:53:37.300]   at more than 15 reps per set.
[03:53:37.300 --> 03:53:40.720]   It's very challenging to maintain the focus required
[03:53:40.720 --> 03:53:44.460]   at rep 27 to actually get sufficient failure by rep 30.
[03:53:44.460 --> 03:53:47.020]   You just give up way too early, it's hard to do.
[03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:49.500]   The same thing at the bottom end of that spectrum
[03:53:49.500 --> 03:53:52.040]   in terms of really heavy to get there.
[03:53:52.040 --> 03:53:55.240]   So I really honestly think eight to 15 is still,
[03:53:55.240 --> 03:53:56.760]   it's cliche, it's that textbook number,
[03:53:56.760 --> 03:53:58.540]   but that's the reason that's a textbook.
[03:53:58.540 --> 03:54:01.140]   It is tried and true and very, very, very effective.
[03:54:01.140 --> 03:54:04.380]   If for instance, you wanna get stronger though
[03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:07.300]   and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy,
[03:54:07.300 --> 03:54:09.220]   you have a couple of tricks you can pull.
[03:54:09.220 --> 03:54:13.320]   Number one, stay south of that five repetition range.
[03:54:13.320 --> 03:54:15.420]   You do sets of one, sets of two,
[03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:20.220]   go as heavy as you can with all appropriate considerations
[03:54:20.220 --> 03:54:22.760]   and stick within maybe even up to three reps per set.
[03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:24.580]   You start getting to four to five to six,
[03:54:24.580 --> 03:54:26.180]   now you're gonna start itching towards
[03:54:26.180 --> 03:54:27.680]   that hypertrophy range.
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:30.740]   So stay down there, do a lot more total sets.
[03:54:30.740 --> 03:54:32.860]   So do a classic example would be something
[03:54:32.860 --> 03:54:35.460]   like eight sets of three, right?
[03:54:35.460 --> 03:54:36.740]   You're gonna get a lot of practice.
[03:54:36.740 --> 03:54:38.700]   You're gonna get 24 very high quality reps
[03:54:38.700 --> 03:54:41.260]   with a lot of rest in between.
[03:54:41.260 --> 03:54:44.540]   You go from there, you go to managing caloric intake,
[03:54:44.540 --> 03:54:46.760]   making sure your protein is still on point,
[03:54:46.760 --> 03:54:49.300]   you wanna recover, but if your total calories
[03:54:49.300 --> 03:54:53.620]   aren't greater than 10 to 15% above your maintenance needs,
[03:54:53.620 --> 03:54:54.940]   then you're not gonna be able to put on
[03:54:54.940 --> 03:54:56.460]   a whole bunch of muscle mass
[03:54:56.460 --> 03:54:58.660]   'cause you just don't have the fuel for it.
[03:54:58.660 --> 03:55:01.060]   You can also then space your workouts out
[03:55:01.060 --> 03:55:03.700]   so that stimulus isn't coming extremely often.
[03:55:03.700 --> 03:55:05.620]   So if you do that thing a couple of times a week,
[03:55:05.620 --> 03:55:08.020]   it's not enough frequency in that signal.
[03:55:08.020 --> 03:55:10.660]   So remember that signal has to be frequent or loud.
[03:55:10.660 --> 03:55:12.460]   You didn't make it super loud
[03:55:12.460 --> 03:55:14.140]   and now you're not making it super frequent.
[03:55:14.140 --> 03:55:16.800]   You can get very, very, very strong like that
[03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:20.060]   and put on very low amounts of hypertrophy
[03:55:20.060 --> 03:55:22.300]   if that's sort of the choice.
[03:55:22.300 --> 03:55:25.200]   - So you told us a lot about volume and frequency
[03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:28.060]   and how that relates to protein synthesis and recovery
[03:55:28.060 --> 03:55:31.640]   to evoke the hypertrophy adaptation response.
[03:55:31.640 --> 03:55:35.700]   How should people think about systemic damage and recovery?
[03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:38.180]   - Because obviously the nervous system
[03:55:38.180 --> 03:55:40.700]   and the way it interacts with the neuromuscular system
[03:55:40.700 --> 03:55:43.260]   is the site of all the action here
[03:55:43.260 --> 03:55:45.200]   or at least a lot of the action.
[03:55:45.200 --> 03:55:49.100]   And the nervous system can in fact become fatigued.
[03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:51.640]   It has a great capacity,
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:53.920]   but the whole system that we're talking about
[03:55:53.920 --> 03:55:58.180]   can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group
[03:55:58.180 --> 03:56:00.700]   like the biceps or the back is being allowed to rest
[03:56:00.700 --> 03:56:02.840]   while you're training legs and other muscle groups,
[03:56:02.840 --> 03:56:06.160]   that your whole neuromuscular system needs rest.
[03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:08.840]   How does one determine whether or not your entire body
[03:56:08.840 --> 03:56:11.720]   needs complete rest or low level active rest
[03:56:11.720 --> 03:56:13.200]   or exercise of a different kind?
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:14.040]   - Yeah, yeah, sure.
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:15.640]   So I want to actually tackle this
[03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:17.240]   'cause we're on the topic of hypertrophy.
[03:56:17.240 --> 03:56:19.880]   I'm assuming that that's the goal in mind here.
[03:56:19.880 --> 03:56:21.520]   - Yes, here I'm asking specifically
[03:56:21.520 --> 03:56:23.020]   within the context of hypertrophy,
[03:56:23.020 --> 03:56:25.440]   I realized that for other training goals,
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:26.920]   the answer to this question could be quite different.
[03:56:26.920 --> 03:56:27.760]   - Yeah, okay.
[03:56:27.760 --> 03:56:28.800]   So we actually do this in a couple of different ways.
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:30.960]   Let's start local and work back to systemic, right?
[03:56:30.960 --> 03:56:34.600]   Because number one, what you're really concerned about
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:37.520]   is at the local muscle level
[03:56:37.520 --> 03:56:39.900]   is am I going to create excessive damage?
[03:56:39.900 --> 03:56:41.560]   And I don't necessarily mean muscle damage here.
[03:56:41.560 --> 03:56:42.680]   I mean injury, right?
[03:56:42.680 --> 03:56:44.240]   So the kind of rule of thumb we use
[03:56:44.240 --> 03:56:46.040]   is like three out of 10 in terms of soreness.
[03:56:46.040 --> 03:56:49.200]   If you're more than three out of 10 in terms of soreness,
[03:56:49.200 --> 03:56:50.740]   we're going to start asking questions.
[03:56:50.740 --> 03:56:52.840]   If you're higher than six out of 10,
[03:56:52.840 --> 03:56:54.140]   we're probably not training.
[03:56:54.140 --> 03:56:55.200]   - This is a subjective measure.
[03:56:55.200 --> 03:56:56.620]   - Total subjective measure, right?
[03:56:56.620 --> 03:56:58.640]   And you'll know very quickly, right?
[03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:01.120]   I feel like if you can barely graze your pec
[03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:02.220]   with your fingertip, and then you're like,
[03:57:02.220 --> 03:57:05.320]   ah, I don't care what you score that, we're not training.
[03:57:05.320 --> 03:57:06.440]   There's just no damage.
[03:57:06.440 --> 03:57:08.300]   If you're three out of 10, if you're just like,
[03:57:08.300 --> 03:57:10.040]   oh, I'm kind of like a little bit stiff here,
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:12.400]   but once you get warmed up, you start feeling okay,
[03:57:12.400 --> 03:57:14.280]   you're probably okay to proceed there.
[03:57:14.280 --> 03:57:19.160]   So that is a very easy way to just think about soreness.
[03:57:19.160 --> 03:57:20.160]   You're going to be a little bit tight
[03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:22.060]   depending on your training frequency.
[03:57:22.060 --> 03:57:24.880]   Now, zooming out to systemic, we use a whole host of things.
[03:57:24.880 --> 03:57:28.120]   So we actually have a whole host of bowel markers we use.
[03:57:28.120 --> 03:57:29.080]   You can get a lot of these from blood.
[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:31.220]   So you can look at things like creatine kinase.
[03:57:31.220 --> 03:57:33.960]   That's the very common one marker of muscle damage.
[03:57:33.960 --> 03:57:36.200]   We'll actually look at LDH.
[03:57:36.200 --> 03:57:38.280]   We'll look at myoglobulin.
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:39.960]   That's just like, if you think about hemoglobin
[03:57:39.960 --> 03:57:44.000]   is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout your blood.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:47.160]   The myoglobin is the part of that that's actually in muscle.
[03:57:47.160 --> 03:57:48.580]   So when muscle gets broken down,
[03:57:48.580 --> 03:57:50.240]   that gets leaked out and put in your blood.
[03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:51.480]   That's one of the markers, actually,
[03:57:51.480 --> 03:57:53.240]   that's going to be associated with things like rhabdo,
[03:57:53.240 --> 03:57:56.160]   which is like, you're going to see your urine is purple,
[03:57:56.160 --> 03:57:57.120]   and it's extremely dark
[03:57:57.120 --> 03:57:59.420]   because you've got so much muscle breakdown that happens
[03:57:59.420 --> 03:58:00.720]   and kidneys get a problem
[03:58:00.720 --> 03:58:01.880]   and you put a bunch of stuff in there.
[03:58:01.880 --> 03:58:03.440]   So we use those biomarkers.
[03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:05.500]   We'll actually also look at probably a couple of things
[03:58:05.500 --> 03:58:07.980]   you're familiar with, ALT and AST.
[03:58:07.980 --> 03:58:10.080]   These are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown.
[03:58:10.080 --> 03:58:11.520]   So if we are actually suspecting
[03:58:11.520 --> 03:58:13.640]   that this is a chronic problem,
[03:58:13.640 --> 03:58:16.440]   we're going to actually go and pull some blood.
[03:58:16.440 --> 03:58:17.960]   If it's just like, I'm super sore today,
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:19.400]   we're going to use that subjective marker.
[03:58:19.400 --> 03:58:20.720]   But if we're seeing this as constant,
[03:58:20.720 --> 03:58:22.800]   like, man, are we really pushing you way too much?
[03:58:22.800 --> 03:58:25.120]   Is there some sort of systemic problem?
[03:58:25.120 --> 03:58:25.940]   We're going to blood
[03:58:25.940 --> 03:58:26.920]   and we're going to look at all those different things.
[03:58:26.920 --> 03:58:29.580]   Now, AST to ALT is really specific
[03:58:29.580 --> 03:58:31.520]   and I don't want to take us too far off track here,
[03:58:31.520 --> 03:58:33.260]   but the ratio to those things
[03:58:33.260 --> 03:58:34.400]   is actually very important as well.
[03:58:34.400 --> 03:58:36.960]   So if you look at the AST to ALT ratio,
[03:58:36.960 --> 03:58:39.680]   typically the number we'll look at is like 1.67
[03:58:39.680 --> 03:58:41.320]   as that ratio is like higher than that,
[03:58:41.320 --> 03:58:42.840]   you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage.
[03:58:42.840 --> 03:58:47.840]   But really between me and you and a few of these listeners,
[03:58:47.840 --> 03:58:50.600]   anytime we start seeing AST out kick ALT,
[03:58:50.600 --> 03:58:51.760]   we're immediately thinking,
[03:58:51.760 --> 03:58:53.780]   as in the ratio of being higher than one,
[03:58:53.780 --> 03:58:54.840]   we're immediately thinking
[03:58:54.840 --> 03:58:56.740]   like there's something happening muscle damage wise.
[03:58:56.740 --> 03:58:58.520]   So that's actually a sneaky good indicator
[03:58:58.520 --> 03:59:00.240]   of just total muscle mass
[03:59:00.240 --> 03:59:02.580]   because the vast majority of that's going to be in muscle.
[03:59:02.580 --> 03:59:05.320]   So those are actually some markers that we like a lot.
[03:59:05.320 --> 03:59:08.960]   If muscle damage is the thing we're concerned with.
[03:59:08.960 --> 03:59:10.440]   If we are more concerned with things
[03:59:10.440 --> 03:59:13.920]   like total training volume, systemic overload,
[03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:16.820]   then we may turn to something more like sleep.
[03:59:16.820 --> 03:59:18.980]   There's a lot of information we can actually glean
[03:59:18.980 --> 03:59:22.320]   from changes in sleep behavior and function.
[03:59:22.320 --> 03:59:24.360]   You could also look at things like HRV,
[03:59:24.360 --> 03:59:27.140]   heart rate variability, which is a very classic marker
[03:59:27.140 --> 03:59:29.840]   and much more sensitive to changes with training
[03:59:29.840 --> 03:59:31.800]   than something like a resting heart rate,
[03:59:31.800 --> 03:59:33.440]   which is one thing you can actually do
[03:59:33.440 --> 03:59:34.380]   that's totally cost free.
[03:59:34.380 --> 03:59:35.940]   Just look at your changes
[03:59:35.940 --> 03:59:39.420]   and any elevation resting heart rate over time,
[03:59:39.420 --> 03:59:42.060]   especially more than three to five consecutive days
[03:59:42.060 --> 03:59:42.900]   is an indicator.
[03:59:42.900 --> 03:59:45.600]   But HRV is much more sensitive
[03:59:45.600 --> 03:59:47.520]   to things like training induced overload.
[03:59:47.520 --> 03:59:49.540]   So that's a quick version of stuff
[03:59:49.540 --> 03:59:50.480]   that we're going to pay attention to.
[03:59:50.480 --> 03:59:53.880]   The last one I would add there is simply motivation.
[03:59:53.880 --> 03:59:55.200]   So if you're really training hard
[03:59:55.200 --> 03:59:56.040]   and you like training hard
[03:59:56.040 --> 03:59:58.920]   and you just like cannot force yourself to go anymore,
[03:59:58.920 --> 04:00:00.800]   that end of itself can be a good indication
[04:00:00.800 --> 04:00:03.640]   of it's maybe not the day, maybe not the week.
[04:00:03.640 --> 04:00:05.640]   With all of these things,
[04:00:05.640 --> 04:00:07.240]   you want to be careful about overreacting
[04:00:07.240 --> 04:00:09.200]   to a single day measure.
[04:00:09.200 --> 04:00:11.800]   Again, we need to look at at least a trend
[04:00:11.800 --> 04:00:12.960]   of more than three days.
[04:00:12.960 --> 04:00:15.280]   Honestly, I'm looking at more than five days.
[04:00:15.280 --> 04:00:16.800]   I'm going to pull back from that
[04:00:16.800 --> 04:00:19.000]   and think about what phase of training we're in,
[04:00:19.000 --> 04:00:20.220]   what part of the year we're in,
[04:00:20.220 --> 04:00:21.840]   typically with our athletes we're in season,
[04:00:21.840 --> 04:00:24.160]   pre-season, post-season, off-season, et cetera,
[04:00:24.160 --> 04:00:26.560]   to make our decision about what we're going to do about it.
[04:00:26.560 --> 04:00:28.240]   Are we canning the entire workout?
[04:00:28.240 --> 04:00:31.580]   Are we doing a modified, lower version, lower intensity?
[04:00:31.580 --> 04:00:34.860]   My default generally, if hypertrophy is the goal,
[04:00:34.860 --> 04:00:38.040]   remember volume is the driver there.
[04:00:38.040 --> 04:00:40.040]   So if I can, like, can we get in?
[04:00:40.040 --> 04:00:41.560]   Can we go real light?
[04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:44.040]   Let's go to six out of 10 RPE.
[04:00:44.040 --> 04:00:46.200]   So relative perceived exertion.
[04:00:46.200 --> 04:00:48.360]   Maybe we'll reduce the range of motion.
[04:00:48.360 --> 04:00:50.600]   Maybe we'll make it a little bit easier.
[04:00:50.600 --> 04:00:52.880]   Maybe we'll go to machines or instead of going a squat,
[04:00:52.880 --> 04:00:56.300]   we'll just do leg extension, something like that.
[04:00:56.300 --> 04:00:57.920]   But I want to still get enough volume in there.
[04:00:57.920 --> 04:00:59.920]   That will keep you on target.
[04:00:59.920 --> 04:01:03.680]   And again, even going at 50%, not to high repetition.
[04:01:03.680 --> 04:01:05.800]   50% for a set of 10, three sets.
[04:01:05.800 --> 04:01:07.480]   Just get a nice blood flow in there,
[04:01:07.480 --> 04:01:09.720]   get it in, get it out, aid in recovery,
[04:01:09.720 --> 04:01:11.180]   and then move on and come back the next day.
[04:01:11.180 --> 04:01:12.280]   That's probably what I would do
[04:01:12.280 --> 04:01:15.280]   rather than canning the entire session.
[04:01:15.280 --> 04:01:18.960]   - How do other forms of exercise
[04:01:18.960 --> 04:01:20.960]   combine with hypertrophy training?
[04:01:20.960 --> 04:01:26.020]   For instance, can I do cardiovascular training
[04:01:26.020 --> 04:01:28.880]   for two or three days per week,
[04:01:28.880 --> 04:01:30.580]   provided that cardiovascular training
[04:01:30.580 --> 04:01:32.760]   is of low enough intensity
[04:01:32.760 --> 04:01:37.400]   and not disrupt hypertrophy progression?
[04:01:37.400 --> 04:01:42.240]   And can I do that cardiovascular exercise
[04:01:42.240 --> 04:01:45.820]   before or after the hypertrophy training?
[04:01:45.820 --> 04:01:47.960]   Or does it need to be separated out?
[04:01:47.960 --> 04:01:50.320]   - The answer to this is really what we call
[04:01:50.320 --> 04:01:52.400]   the crossover air interference effect.
[04:01:52.400 --> 04:01:54.840]   It's really an energy management issue.
[04:01:54.840 --> 04:01:59.360]   So the only time endurance exercise starts to interfere
[04:01:59.360 --> 04:02:02.600]   or block or hinder, attenuate hypertrophy
[04:02:02.600 --> 04:02:04.280]   is in one of two broad categories.
[04:02:04.280 --> 04:02:07.900]   Number one, total energy intake or your balance is off.
[04:02:07.900 --> 04:02:10.500]   So you can ameliorate this by just eating more.
[04:02:10.500 --> 04:02:11.340]   If you do that,
[04:02:11.340 --> 04:02:12.780]   then the interference effect generally goes away.
[04:02:12.780 --> 04:02:14.400]   The second one is you want to make sure
[04:02:14.400 --> 04:02:17.480]   you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training
[04:02:17.480 --> 04:02:19.280]   that are the same working group
[04:02:19.280 --> 04:02:21.040]   and specifically the eccentric portion.
[04:02:21.040 --> 04:02:24.020]   So for example, we see much more interference with running
[04:02:24.020 --> 04:02:27.240]   on leg hypertrophy than we do cycling, right?
[04:02:27.240 --> 04:02:29.480]   Less eccentric pounding and loading, less damage,
[04:02:29.480 --> 04:02:30.880]   less things to recover from.
[04:02:30.880 --> 04:02:33.200]   The tissue seems to be totally fine.
[04:02:33.200 --> 04:02:34.600]   The only other thing you need to worry about here
[04:02:34.600 --> 04:02:37.240]   is total volume of your endurance work.
[04:02:37.240 --> 04:02:39.740]   So if you're doing a moderate intensity
[04:02:39.740 --> 04:02:40.880]   for a moderate duration,
[04:02:40.880 --> 04:02:45.440]   say 70% of your maximum heart rate for 25 minutes,
[04:02:45.440 --> 04:02:47.480]   it's unlikely to do much damage
[04:02:47.480 --> 04:02:49.240]   in terms of blocking hypertrophy.
[04:02:49.240 --> 04:02:50.600]   You're totally fine.
[04:02:50.600 --> 04:02:52.120]   Can you do it before or after your workout?
[04:02:52.120 --> 04:02:54.140]   It's probably not going to matter that much, right?
[04:02:54.140 --> 04:02:56.240]   So pre-fatigue is okay for hypertrophy.
[04:02:56.240 --> 04:02:58.240]   So if your pre-fatigue is coming from endurance,
[04:02:58.240 --> 04:03:00.160]   then you're totally fine.
[04:03:00.160 --> 04:03:01.000]   Not a big deal.
[04:03:01.000 --> 04:03:02.300]   Afterwards, cool.
[04:03:02.300 --> 04:03:04.440]   You want to break it up into multiple sessions.
[04:03:04.440 --> 04:03:05.840]   That's probably better, right?
[04:03:05.840 --> 04:03:07.960]   So if you do your endurance work on a separate day,
[04:03:07.960 --> 04:03:09.880]   that's probably best case scenario.
[04:03:09.880 --> 04:03:10.720]   If you can't do that,
[04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:12.200]   but you can break it up into two workouts.
[04:03:12.200 --> 04:03:13.400]   Say you lift in the morning
[04:03:13.400 --> 04:03:15.840]   and then you do your "cardio" at night.
[04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:17.200]   Maybe that's second best.
[04:03:17.200 --> 04:03:20.080]   Third best is doing it at the end of your lift
[04:03:20.080 --> 04:03:20.900]   and finishing it.
[04:03:20.900 --> 04:03:21.740]   That's fine.
[04:03:21.740 --> 04:03:24.840]   Just make sure that you're maximizing your recovery
[04:03:24.840 --> 04:03:26.960]   on all the other tricks we'll talk about later.
[04:03:26.960 --> 04:03:28.400]   Make sure the calories are there.
[04:03:28.400 --> 04:03:30.460]   Make sure you're not doing a lot of eccentric landing
[04:03:30.460 --> 04:03:33.000]   in that endurance stuff and you'll be just fine.
[04:03:33.000 --> 04:03:35.520]   - And where does higher intensity cardio
[04:03:35.520 --> 04:03:37.120]   fit into a hypertrophy program?
[04:03:37.120 --> 04:03:42.120]   So higher intensity cardio, for instance, in my mind,
[04:03:42.520 --> 04:03:47.520]   is getting on the assault bike and doing eight intervals
[04:03:47.520 --> 04:03:50.560]   of 20 second sprints and 10 second rest in between,
[04:03:50.560 --> 04:03:53.760]   or perhaps going to a field and doing some bounds
[04:03:53.760 --> 04:03:55.680]   and sprints and things of that sort.
[04:03:55.680 --> 04:03:58.760]   Not going all out, not running for one's life,
[04:03:58.760 --> 04:04:03.760]   but getting up to about 85, 90% of running for one's life.
[04:04:03.760 --> 04:04:05.600]   - So we have a lot less information
[04:04:05.600 --> 04:04:09.200]   on the potential interference or not of high intensity stuff.
[04:04:09.200 --> 04:04:12.280]   The stuff we do have suggested it may actually aid
[04:04:12.280 --> 04:04:14.600]   in hypertrophy and that's because if you think about it,
[04:04:14.600 --> 04:04:17.200]   one of the potential paths to activation of muscle growth
[04:04:17.200 --> 04:04:20.080]   is this metabolic disturbance.
[04:04:20.080 --> 04:04:20.960]   You're gonna get that a lot
[04:04:20.960 --> 04:04:22.400]   with the high intensity interval thing.
[04:04:22.400 --> 04:04:24.560]   So it's not a terrible thing to do.
[04:04:24.560 --> 04:04:27.560]   I wouldn't do it to the level that it compromises
[04:04:27.560 --> 04:04:29.840]   your ability to come back and do your primary training.
[04:04:29.840 --> 04:04:32.480]   So if you're so fatigued, your legs are super heavy,
[04:04:32.480 --> 04:04:35.840]   they're depleted, you now have to ingest extra carbohydrates
[04:04:35.840 --> 04:04:38.180]   to replenish muscle glycogen to be able to handle
[04:04:38.180 --> 04:04:40.720]   both recovery and continued training, et cetera.
[04:04:40.720 --> 04:04:42.100]   That could then lead to a problem,
[04:04:42.100 --> 04:04:44.720]   but in general, we really don't see any reason
[04:04:44.720 --> 04:04:47.880]   why that is going to completely block or make it
[04:04:47.880 --> 04:04:50.000]   such that your training was quote unquote wasted
[04:04:50.000 --> 04:04:50.940]   or it didn't work.
[04:04:50.940 --> 04:04:55.840]   And in fact, actually, a very recent study came out
[04:04:55.840 --> 04:04:59.620]   where they had individuals perform six weeks
[04:04:59.620 --> 04:05:02.920]   of purely aerobic endurance, steady state,
[04:05:02.920 --> 04:05:04.400]   long duration endurance for six weeks,
[04:05:04.400 --> 04:05:06.740]   I think, prior to starting a hypertrophy phase.
[04:05:06.740 --> 04:05:09.600]   Compare that to individuals who did not do that.
[04:05:09.600 --> 04:05:12.600]   And those folks that did these six weeks of just,
[04:05:12.600 --> 04:05:16.660]   I think it was cycling actually, just endurance work
[04:05:16.660 --> 04:05:19.340]   had more muscle growth at the end of their hypertrophy
[04:05:19.340 --> 04:05:21.340]   training than those folks that did not.
[04:05:21.340 --> 04:05:24.900]   So this shows you very clearly there are a lot of advantages
[04:05:24.900 --> 04:05:27.740]   that come with being physically fit to growing muscle.
[04:05:27.740 --> 04:05:31.420]   So folks that also have actually hit plateaus a lot,
[04:05:31.420 --> 04:05:33.580]   one of the things you may actually see some benefit from
[04:05:33.580 --> 04:05:35.480]   is actually doing a little bit more endurance work,
[04:05:35.480 --> 04:05:36.740]   whether it's the steady state stuff,
[04:05:36.740 --> 04:05:39.500]   maybe it's the higher intensity stuff.
[04:05:39.500 --> 04:05:41.500]   Certainly if you're starting a training phase,
[04:05:41.500 --> 04:05:43.060]   it's a pretty good idea to do that.
[04:05:43.060 --> 04:05:45.340]   And there's a number of physiological reasons
[04:05:45.340 --> 04:05:47.120]   of why that's potentially occurring.
[04:05:47.120 --> 04:05:50.900]   But the lowest hanging fruit here is we sort of joke,
[04:05:50.900 --> 04:05:53.060]   you know, like if you're so unfit
[04:05:53.060 --> 04:05:55.180]   that you're tying your shoes in your warmup
[04:05:55.180 --> 04:05:56.720]   and you're already breaking a sweat,
[04:05:56.720 --> 04:05:59.380]   you probably don't have enough fitness
[04:05:59.380 --> 04:06:01.700]   to do enough training to get enough hypertrophy.
[04:06:01.700 --> 04:06:03.980]   So that is in fact your limiting factor.
[04:06:03.980 --> 04:06:06.720]   You're not recovering, you're super fatigued
[04:06:06.720 --> 04:06:10.180]   and damaged and sore because you're so unfit.
[04:06:10.180 --> 04:06:12.600]   So get fit first and then you can actually
[04:06:12.600 --> 04:06:14.480]   get more gains a week later.
[04:06:14.480 --> 04:06:16.640]   So you have to kind of kick the can down the road
[04:06:16.640 --> 04:06:18.660]   for a few weeks, but 10 weeks later,
[04:06:18.660 --> 04:06:20.240]   you'll be in a better spot than you were
[04:06:20.240 --> 04:06:22.000]   by investing a little bit in your conditioning.
[04:06:22.000 --> 04:06:23.000]   - So as you pointed out before,
[04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:25.320]   and I can only assume you're referring to me,
[04:06:25.320 --> 04:06:27.180]   hypertrophy training is idiot proof.
[04:06:27.180 --> 04:06:30.380]   Meaning there's a lot of leeway in the variables,
[04:06:30.380 --> 04:06:34.120]   but not so much leeway that people can do anything.
[04:06:34.120 --> 04:06:36.980]   It's bounded by these general principles.
[04:06:36.980 --> 04:06:39.400]   So with your permission,
[04:06:39.400 --> 04:06:42.700]   I'm going to do a brief overview of my notes
[04:06:42.700 --> 04:06:46.380]   based on your description of the modifiable variables
[04:06:46.380 --> 04:06:49.740]   that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy.
[04:06:49.740 --> 04:06:52.580]   Keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise choice,
[04:06:52.580 --> 04:06:55.800]   exercise order, selecting appropriate volume
[04:06:55.800 --> 04:06:58.120]   that sets in reps, training frequency,
[04:06:58.120 --> 04:07:02.820]   and needing some metric or way to have progression,
[04:07:02.820 --> 04:07:05.360]   either by adding more weight or by more tension
[04:07:05.360 --> 04:07:07.320]   or more metabolic stress and so on.
[04:07:07.320 --> 04:07:09.880]   In terms of exercise choice,
[04:07:09.880 --> 04:07:12.440]   it sounds like the choice of exercises
[04:07:12.440 --> 04:07:16.220]   is not super critical in terms of specificity,
[04:07:16.220 --> 04:07:20.000]   but that the ideal circumstances that people are targeting
[04:07:20.000 --> 04:07:23.200]   all the major and frankly secondary
[04:07:23.200 --> 04:07:26.600]   and minor muscle groups, if you can even call them that,
[04:07:26.600 --> 04:07:28.480]   across their exercise choices.
[04:07:28.480 --> 04:07:31.960]   That they're picking exercises that they can perform safely
[04:07:31.960 --> 04:07:33.720]   and that they can generate enough intensity
[04:07:33.720 --> 04:07:35.780]   so that they're getting close to failure
[04:07:35.780 --> 04:07:38.960]   without placing themselves into danger, right?
[04:07:38.960 --> 04:07:41.200]   So for some people that might mean
[04:07:41.200 --> 04:07:43.220]   including large compound free weight exercises
[04:07:43.220 --> 04:07:46.560]   like squats and deadlifts and bent over barbell rows,
[04:07:46.560 --> 04:07:48.820]   as well as isolation exercises.
[04:07:48.820 --> 04:07:51.440]   And for some people there might be a bias
[04:07:51.440 --> 04:07:53.660]   toward more isolation exercises and machines,
[04:07:53.660 --> 04:07:55.380]   but of course machines don't necessarily mean
[04:07:55.380 --> 04:07:57.300]   that you can't use heavy loads.
[04:07:57.300 --> 04:07:59.740]   In fact, plate loaded machines like hammer strength machines
[04:07:59.740 --> 04:08:02.420]   will allow for quite substantial loads.
[04:08:02.420 --> 04:08:07.420]   So picking two or three or more movements per muscle group
[04:08:07.420 --> 04:08:09.800]   can be valuable,
[04:08:09.800 --> 04:08:14.800]   but that overall consistency is going to outshine variation
[04:08:14.800 --> 04:08:18.900]   in the sense that you don't need to hit muscles
[04:08:18.900 --> 04:08:20.720]   with a different exercise every workout.
[04:08:20.720 --> 04:08:23.840]   Coming back to the same thing has a benefit.
[04:08:23.840 --> 04:08:25.340]   And we heard about this in our discussion
[04:08:25.340 --> 04:08:27.440]   around strength and power as well.
[04:08:27.440 --> 04:08:30.440]   - Okay, in terms of order of exercises,
[04:08:30.440 --> 04:08:33.280]   there too it sounds like there's a lot of flexibility.
[04:08:33.280 --> 04:08:37.040]   One could do the large compound exercise
[04:08:37.040 --> 04:08:39.920]   for let's say quadriceps and hamstrings and glutes first,
[04:08:39.920 --> 04:08:41.920]   like a squat or a front squat
[04:08:41.920 --> 04:08:44.620]   or could deadlift for that matter.
[04:08:44.620 --> 04:08:46.620]   But then if one deadlifted
[04:08:46.620 --> 04:08:48.220]   and primarily hit the glutes and hamstrings,
[04:08:48.220 --> 04:08:51.280]   then you might want to target the quadriceps
[04:08:51.280 --> 04:08:52.880]   more directly with leg extensions.
[04:08:52.880 --> 04:08:56.240]   Or if one squatted and was loading that squat bar,
[04:08:56.240 --> 04:08:57.400]   carrying the squat bar in a way
[04:08:57.400 --> 04:08:59.580]   that was predominantly quadricep
[04:08:59.580 --> 04:09:02.080]   and less so glute and hamstring,
[04:09:02.080 --> 04:09:04.260]   then leg curls would be a good choice, et cetera.
[04:09:04.260 --> 04:09:07.160]   Okay, and train your calves folks.
[04:09:07.160 --> 04:09:08.000]   Very important.
[04:09:08.000 --> 04:09:09.840]   Unless you're a genetic freak, of course,
[04:09:09.840 --> 04:09:11.160]   that's actually a good opportunity to say,
[04:09:11.160 --> 04:09:12.300]   unless you're a genetic freak
[04:09:12.300 --> 04:09:14.460]   or you just have a genetic predisposition
[04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:15.400]   or you've done sports
[04:09:15.400 --> 04:09:17.040]   and you have a genetic predisposition
[04:09:17.040 --> 04:09:19.400]   that gives you very large calves
[04:09:19.400 --> 04:09:20.720]   that don't require any training at all.
[04:09:20.720 --> 04:09:22.220]   I know people like this.
[04:09:22.220 --> 04:09:24.280]   They're somewhat rare, but they're out there.
[04:09:24.280 --> 04:09:26.840]   And those folks sometimes want to stay away from
[04:09:26.840 --> 04:09:28.040]   or minimize their training.
[04:09:28.040 --> 04:09:30.280]   You told me that even if you have a muscle group
[04:09:30.280 --> 04:09:33.640]   that's a hyper responder in terms of hypertrophy,
[04:09:33.640 --> 04:09:37.660]   getting at least one or two good hard sets per week
[04:09:37.660 --> 04:09:39.600]   is good because you want to keep functionality
[04:09:39.600 --> 04:09:40.840]   in that neuromuscular system.
[04:09:40.840 --> 04:09:41.680]   - Love it.
[04:09:41.680 --> 04:09:42.500]   - Okay.
[04:09:42.500 --> 04:09:43.680]   In terms of volume,
[04:09:43.680 --> 04:09:46.320]   again, we have a large amount of variation
[04:09:46.320 --> 04:09:47.760]   is what I'm hearing,
[04:09:47.760 --> 04:09:50.380]   that the total number of sets per week
[04:09:50.380 --> 04:09:52.440]   is a strong driving force
[04:09:52.440 --> 04:09:55.380]   of program design and selection.
[04:09:55.380 --> 04:09:59.280]   That ideally you're performing 10 to 20
[04:09:59.280 --> 04:10:01.880]   and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per week.
[04:10:01.880 --> 04:10:05.020]   And that can be divided up across multiple workouts
[04:10:05.020 --> 04:10:06.480]   or done in one workout,
[04:10:06.480 --> 04:10:10.960]   but that's 10 to 20 sets per week per muscle group.
[04:10:10.960 --> 04:10:13.760]   Not really taking into account indirect activation.
[04:10:13.760 --> 04:10:17.520]   So that would be 10 to 20 sets for biceps.
[04:10:17.520 --> 04:10:19.780]   Your back work is going to hit your biceps a little bit,
[04:10:19.780 --> 04:10:22.760]   maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection,
[04:10:22.760 --> 04:10:24.420]   but it's really 10 to 20.
[04:10:24.420 --> 04:10:26.980]   And given that hypertrophy can still occur
[04:10:26.980 --> 04:10:30.120]   and maybe even occurs better with more volume,
[04:10:30.120 --> 04:10:32.220]   then don't include the indirect work
[04:10:32.220 --> 04:10:35.520]   unless something about the architecture of your body
[04:10:35.520 --> 04:10:38.740]   and the inability to engage certain muscle groups
[04:10:38.740 --> 04:10:41.500]   makes a pull-up really an arm exercise for you.
[04:10:41.500 --> 04:10:42.340]   Do I have that right?
[04:10:42.340 --> 04:10:43.620]   - The way that I would maybe define it
[04:10:43.620 --> 04:10:45.060]   is typically with movements,
[04:10:45.060 --> 04:10:47.680]   we consider to be there to be primary movers,
[04:10:47.680 --> 04:10:50.960]   secondary movers, and then tertiary movers, right?
[04:10:50.960 --> 04:10:54.040]   If it is a primary or secondary, I'm probably counting it.
[04:10:54.040 --> 04:10:56.960]   If it's tertiary or less, I'm probably not counting it.
[04:10:56.960 --> 04:10:57.800]   - Got it.
[04:10:57.800 --> 04:11:00.560]   So going back to our example of a pull-up.
[04:11:00.560 --> 04:11:01.840]   - So in the example of a pull-up,
[04:11:01.840 --> 04:11:03.640]   I probably wouldn't count the biceps in a pull-up,
[04:11:03.640 --> 04:11:06.200]   but I would probably count the biceps during a chin-up.
[04:11:06.200 --> 04:11:08.640]   - Would you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up?
[04:11:08.640 --> 04:11:10.440]   - Probably not, maybe.
[04:11:10.440 --> 04:11:13.640]   It just depends, probably not though.
[04:11:13.640 --> 04:11:15.880]   - Okay, train the rear delts also.
[04:11:15.880 --> 04:11:16.940]   - Honestly, the reason I answered that
[04:11:16.940 --> 04:11:18.040]   is because most people don't do anything
[04:11:18.040 --> 04:11:19.240]   for the real delts anyways.
[04:11:19.240 --> 04:11:20.120]   - But they should, right?
[04:11:20.120 --> 04:11:20.960]   - Absolutely.
[04:11:20.960 --> 04:11:21.780]   That's why I didn't want to count it.
[04:11:21.780 --> 04:11:22.620]   I wanted you to go out of your way
[04:11:22.620 --> 04:11:24.360]   to make sure you did something specifically
[04:11:24.360 --> 04:11:25.520]   for the rear delts.
[04:11:25.520 --> 04:11:29.060]   - For aesthetics and for functionality and balance
[04:11:29.060 --> 04:11:29.900]   across the shoulders.
[04:11:29.900 --> 04:11:32.840]   - Totally, neck, shoulder, all of it.
[04:11:32.840 --> 04:11:34.320]   - I'm so happy to hear you say this.
[04:11:34.320 --> 04:11:37.560]   I'm a huge fan of people doing rear deltoid work
[04:11:37.560 --> 04:11:38.760]   for all the reasons you described
[04:11:38.760 --> 04:11:40.840]   and neck work for that matter.
[04:11:40.840 --> 04:11:42.040]   I think people forget that the neck
[04:11:42.040 --> 04:11:43.940]   is the upper part of your spine.
[04:11:43.940 --> 04:11:47.240]   And for postural reasons and for stabilization
[04:11:47.240 --> 04:11:48.880]   and safety reasons, it's really critical.
[04:11:48.880 --> 04:11:51.600]   But I think most people aren't familiar
[04:11:51.600 --> 04:11:54.240]   with how best to train the rear deltoids and neck.
[04:11:54.240 --> 04:11:55.920]   And I know a number of people are afraid
[04:11:55.920 --> 04:11:58.080]   of getting a big neck,
[04:11:58.080 --> 04:12:01.160]   which for reasons that are still unclear to me
[04:12:01.160 --> 04:12:02.380]   is referred to as no neck.
[04:12:02.380 --> 04:12:05.920]   But let's leave out that no neck comment for the moment.
[04:12:05.920 --> 04:12:07.760]   What are some good exercises for targeting
[04:12:07.760 --> 04:12:11.100]   the rear deltoids and neck safely
[04:12:11.100 --> 04:12:15.120]   that people can perform for stabilization
[04:12:15.120 --> 04:12:16.800]   and for hypertrophy?
[04:12:16.800 --> 04:12:20.080]   - Yeah, I would recommend people check out Eric Cressy.
[04:12:20.080 --> 04:12:23.200]   He's a wonderful strength conditioning coach.
[04:12:23.200 --> 04:12:25.740]   He actually is, I think, the director of pitching
[04:12:25.740 --> 04:12:27.080]   for the New York Yankees now.
[04:12:27.080 --> 04:12:29.360]   - Is that spelled C-R-E-S-S-I-E?
[04:12:29.360 --> 04:12:32.160]   - C-R-E-S-S-E-Y, I believe.
[04:12:32.160 --> 04:12:35.480]   And he's got a facility in, I believe,
[04:12:35.480 --> 04:12:37.840]   Boston as well as in Florida.
[04:12:37.840 --> 04:12:40.440]   So he's very, very involved in pitching
[04:12:40.440 --> 04:12:42.140]   as well as hockey and things like that.
[04:12:42.140 --> 04:12:47.140]   So he has so many free videos and resources
[04:12:47.140 --> 04:12:49.560]   on so much of the shoulder girdle,
[04:12:49.560 --> 04:12:51.460]   mostly because he's dealt with overhead
[04:12:51.460 --> 04:12:52.300]   and throwing athletes.
[04:12:52.300 --> 04:12:55.040]   And so the precision required there is tremendous.
[04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:57.260]   So you wanna be very careful
[04:12:57.260 --> 04:12:58.780]   when you start playing in this area
[04:12:58.780 --> 04:13:01.620]   because the wrong positioning of your scapula
[04:13:01.620 --> 04:13:03.500]   can cause a whole bunch of problems
[04:13:03.500 --> 04:13:04.680]   in your neck and low back.
[04:13:04.680 --> 04:13:06.200]   And so he would be a great resource
[04:13:06.200 --> 04:13:07.400]   to go take a look at that.
[04:13:07.400 --> 04:13:10.880]   Depending on how your scapulas are gliding and sliding
[04:13:10.880 --> 04:13:14.040]   and the way that you want your rotator cuffs firing,
[04:13:14.040 --> 04:13:17.420]   your rhomboids, it's very complicated very quickly.
[04:13:17.420 --> 04:13:19.160]   So you wanna learn more, go there.
[04:13:19.160 --> 04:13:22.760]   As a very, very quick couple of answers,
[04:13:22.760 --> 04:13:25.840]   one of my favorite exercises is lying on a bench
[04:13:25.840 --> 04:13:27.280]   or putting some bench
[04:13:27.280 --> 04:13:30.220]   and then just doing a reverse fly, basically.
[04:13:30.220 --> 04:13:32.600]   The reason I like stabilizing the rest of the body
[04:13:32.600 --> 04:13:33.900]   is so you can make sure you can focus
[04:13:33.900 --> 04:13:35.560]   on just using those rear deltoids
[04:13:35.560 --> 04:13:37.440]   and putting your scapulas in the right position.
[04:13:37.440 --> 04:13:39.680]   Now there's a specific set of queuing
[04:13:39.680 --> 04:13:41.880]   that you want the scapula to move down and back for.
[04:13:41.880 --> 04:13:44.500]   Again, check out Eric or any number of folks
[04:13:44.500 --> 04:13:45.740]   in that area to do it.
[04:13:45.740 --> 04:13:49.360]   But that's a very simple way, the reverse fly to get there.
[04:13:49.360 --> 04:13:51.560]   - Great, and then in terms of neck exercises,
[04:13:51.560 --> 04:13:53.800]   I was told to avoid bridges
[04:13:53.800 --> 04:13:55.800]   because they can cause damage to the discs.
[04:13:55.800 --> 04:13:56.920]   Is that true? - I will probably never do
[04:13:56.920 --> 04:13:59.400]   a bridge ever the rest of my life.
[04:13:59.400 --> 04:14:02.720]   So isometrics are a great exercise for that
[04:14:02.720 --> 04:14:06.520]   because if you think about what you're asking muscle groups
[04:14:06.520 --> 04:14:08.840]   to do, in the neck, you mostly want it to be able to do
[04:14:08.840 --> 04:14:10.000]   a certain type of rotation,
[04:14:10.000 --> 04:14:13.700]   a little bit of flexion extension and some other movements,
[04:14:13.700 --> 04:14:16.440]   but in general, it should be being stable.
[04:14:16.440 --> 04:14:18.000]   So you wanna walk through these joints,
[04:14:18.000 --> 04:14:18.920]   asking kind of what they do.
[04:14:18.920 --> 04:14:20.920]   Are they a moving joint or are they a stability joint?
[04:14:20.920 --> 04:14:21.900]   In this case, you wanna do there.
[04:14:21.900 --> 04:14:24.760]   So isometrics are gonna put you in a much better position.
[04:14:24.760 --> 04:14:26.560]   There's some actually pretty cool devices
[04:14:26.560 --> 04:14:28.120]   that you can wear and you can put them on your head
[04:14:28.120 --> 04:14:30.360]   and you can do all kinds of movement
[04:14:30.360 --> 04:14:32.040]   and get some great training there.
[04:14:32.040 --> 04:14:34.120]   Those are great starts, but if you don't have any of that,
[04:14:34.120 --> 04:14:37.320]   just basic isometrics are a great way to go about it.
[04:14:37.320 --> 04:14:39.920]   Neck bridges would not be on that list for me.
[04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:41.280]   - No neck bridges, folks.
[04:14:41.280 --> 04:14:45.320]   In terms of sets and repetitions,
[04:14:45.320 --> 04:14:46.440]   we briefly touched on this,
[04:14:46.440 --> 04:14:49.700]   but anywhere from, I believe, six repetitions
[04:14:49.700 --> 04:14:51.120]   all the way up to 30 repetitions,
[04:14:51.120 --> 04:14:56.120]   but probably more in the eight to 15 repetition range
[04:14:56.120 --> 04:14:57.560]   for hypertrophy.
[04:14:57.560 --> 04:14:58.640]   - Most of the time, yeah.
[04:14:58.640 --> 04:15:01.660]   - And I'll just throw in there 'cause I love this idea
[04:15:01.660 --> 04:15:06.660]   that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation
[04:15:06.660 --> 04:15:09.780]   related to strength and hypertrophy, that seven to nine range
[04:15:09.780 --> 04:15:14.780]   that the no woman's land of training repetitions.
[04:15:14.780 --> 04:15:17.240]   - I always joke in class.
[04:15:17.240 --> 04:15:18.800]   I'm like, okay, we go through the whole thing, right?
[04:15:18.800 --> 04:15:21.780]   You're like one to five strength, eight to 12,
[04:15:21.780 --> 04:15:22.880]   hypertrophy, and you're like, great.
[04:15:22.880 --> 04:15:23.720]   And then I'm like, okay,
[04:15:23.720 --> 04:15:25.560]   so six to nine means nothing will happen at all.
[04:15:25.560 --> 04:15:28.740]   And the kids are just like writing it down like.
[04:15:28.740 --> 04:15:30.680]   - Right, a good way for everybody to remember
[04:15:30.680 --> 04:15:32.880]   that there are adaptations triggered
[04:15:32.880 --> 04:15:34.040]   in the six to nine rep range
[04:15:34.040 --> 04:15:35.560]   and it's a balance of strength and height.
[04:15:35.560 --> 04:15:37.580]   - You'll just get thrown out of any gym that I'm a part of.
[04:15:37.580 --> 04:15:39.080]   - Fantastic. - If you do that.
[04:15:39.080 --> 04:15:44.140]   - But the important point is to get close to failure
[04:15:44.140 --> 04:15:45.920]   and occasionally hit failure,
[04:15:45.920 --> 04:15:48.820]   maybe occasionally throw in a forced repetition
[04:15:48.820 --> 04:15:51.560]   or a rest pause where you rest and then do a few more,
[04:15:51.560 --> 04:15:52.400]   something like that.
[04:15:52.400 --> 04:15:54.960]   But those intensity increasing maneuvers
[04:15:54.960 --> 04:15:58.800]   will require a little bit more attention to recovery,
[04:15:58.800 --> 04:16:01.020]   either time or attention in some other way.
[04:16:01.020 --> 04:16:04.120]   - And here's a little bit of carrot I'll throw at people.
[04:16:04.120 --> 04:16:06.480]   Because people generally don't like to be told
[04:16:06.480 --> 04:16:08.880]   to not go to failure that often, right?
[04:16:08.880 --> 04:16:11.120]   So there's a handful of like half the folks are like, sweet,
[04:16:11.120 --> 04:16:13.040]   I don't have to train that hard to get there.
[04:16:13.040 --> 04:16:14.640]   And those folks it's like, well, yes.
[04:16:14.640 --> 04:16:17.100]   But I also said, you just can't like do a half workout.
[04:16:17.100 --> 04:16:19.520]   You have to get pretty darn close to failure.
[04:16:19.520 --> 04:16:21.760]   And most people don't really know what failure means.
[04:16:21.760 --> 04:16:22.960]   So for that group, it's actually,
[04:16:22.960 --> 04:16:25.360]   it's still probably harder than you think you wanna train.
[04:16:25.360 --> 04:16:26.200]   The other group though,
[04:16:26.200 --> 04:16:27.920]   that like wants to completely blow themselves out
[04:16:27.920 --> 04:16:29.560]   every single time.
[04:16:29.560 --> 04:16:32.440]   Dragging them back is more the key.
[04:16:32.440 --> 04:16:34.660]   Now for those folks, here's what I can say.
[04:16:34.660 --> 04:16:37.500]   If you make sure that your hidden stressors
[04:16:37.500 --> 04:16:40.640]   and visible stressors are completely taken care of,
[04:16:40.640 --> 04:16:42.980]   you can go to failure a lot more often.
[04:16:42.980 --> 04:16:45.120]   And so you need to dial those things in
[04:16:45.120 --> 04:16:46.480]   and then now you can go hammer yourself
[04:16:46.480 --> 04:16:48.080]   because you'll recover so much quicker.
[04:16:48.080 --> 04:16:52.160]   And we see this very commonly in all of our programs
[04:16:52.160 --> 04:16:54.620]   with our athletes and our non-athletes.
[04:16:54.620 --> 04:16:56.640]   That when we get that the rest of the hidden
[04:16:56.640 --> 04:16:58.280]   and visible stressors taken care of,
[04:16:58.280 --> 04:17:00.240]   their training volume goes up so much
[04:17:00.240 --> 04:17:01.600]   because they'll just start coming back
[04:17:01.600 --> 04:17:03.800]   and then it's like, oh my God, I'm not sore anymore.
[04:17:03.800 --> 04:17:05.400]   Oh my God, I'm not nearly as sore.
[04:17:05.400 --> 04:17:08.600]   I did this exact workout countless times before
[04:17:08.600 --> 04:17:10.320]   and now I'm doing it and I'm not sore at all anymore.
[04:17:10.320 --> 04:17:11.160]   What the hell?
[04:17:11.160 --> 04:17:12.960]   Like we didn't do anything different with the programming
[04:17:12.960 --> 04:17:14.020]   or really the nutrition,
[04:17:14.020 --> 04:17:17.320]   but we got the rest of that allostatic load under control
[04:17:17.320 --> 04:17:19.440]   and boom, things take off.
[04:17:19.440 --> 04:17:21.120]   - That's a lot like drivers.
[04:17:21.120 --> 04:17:22.960]   So many people seem to be riding the brake
[04:17:22.960 --> 04:17:25.720]   and so many people seem to be heavy on the accelerator.
[04:17:25.720 --> 04:17:27.180]   - Yeah, that's actually one of the ways we describe it.
[04:17:27.180 --> 04:17:28.760]   It's like, you want to go faster?
[04:17:28.760 --> 04:17:31.480]   People's inclination, step one is to hit the gas.
[04:17:31.480 --> 04:17:33.280]   Our step number one is making sure
[04:17:33.280 --> 04:17:35.080]   your left foot's not on the brake.
[04:17:35.080 --> 04:17:37.020]   You'll go faster with less resistance,
[04:17:37.020 --> 04:17:39.380]   which means you'll actually wear down the system
[04:17:39.380 --> 04:17:41.600]   a lot slower by just taking your foot off the brake first.
[04:17:41.600 --> 04:17:42.980]   If you're then not going fast enough,
[04:17:42.980 --> 04:17:44.400]   now we can push the accelerator.
[04:17:44.400 --> 04:17:45.720]   But I'm not pushing the accelerator
[04:17:45.720 --> 04:17:47.140]   while your foot's still on the brake.
[04:17:47.140 --> 04:17:48.560]   You're going to go a little bit faster,
[04:17:48.560 --> 04:17:51.000]   but not as fast as you should be going with that much work
[04:17:51.000 --> 04:17:52.960]   and you're going to start wearing down brake pedals
[04:17:52.960 --> 04:17:53.800]   and things like that.
[04:17:53.800 --> 04:17:56.680]   - So I like that analogy.
[04:17:56.680 --> 04:18:00.800]   So hitting that 10 to 20 sets per week,
[04:18:00.800 --> 04:18:02.980]   repetition range is pretty broad
[04:18:02.980 --> 04:18:04.240]   provided you get close to failure,
[04:18:04.240 --> 04:18:05.560]   hit failure every once in a while.
[04:18:05.560 --> 04:18:07.920]   Could be the final set of exercise
[04:18:07.920 --> 04:18:10.200]   or maybe do one workout where you hit failure on everything,
[04:18:10.200 --> 04:18:11.840]   but then you don't do it for a few more.
[04:18:11.840 --> 04:18:13.400]   Again, it sounds like there's a lot of play
[04:18:13.400 --> 04:18:14.360]   in the system here.
[04:18:14.360 --> 04:18:18.080]   Rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds
[04:18:18.080 --> 04:18:19.600]   all the way up to three or four minutes,
[04:18:19.600 --> 04:18:21.060]   depending on how heavy you're training
[04:18:21.060 --> 04:18:23.620]   and how close to failure or to failure,
[04:18:23.620 --> 04:18:26.480]   maybe even quote unquote beyond failure,
[04:18:26.480 --> 04:18:27.560]   if there is such a thing.
[04:18:27.560 --> 04:18:30.340]   You're training, throwing in negatives and things like that.
[04:18:30.340 --> 04:18:32.300]   We didn't get into really high intensity techniques,
[04:18:32.300 --> 04:18:35.000]   but people, again, varying the extent
[04:18:35.000 --> 04:18:36.420]   to which they're pushing the system.
[04:18:36.420 --> 04:18:38.940]   But there does seem to be some value
[04:18:38.940 --> 04:18:43.700]   to mixing up the rest between set ranges
[04:18:43.700 --> 04:18:45.640]   across exercises and across workouts,
[04:18:45.640 --> 04:18:48.300]   but you could combine them all in the same workout
[04:18:48.300 --> 04:18:49.140]   is what I heard.
[04:18:49.140 --> 04:18:50.340]   - Yep.
[04:18:50.340 --> 04:18:52.860]   - And then in terms of progression,
[04:18:52.860 --> 04:18:56.400]   it sounds to me like the goal when hypertrophy training
[04:18:56.400 --> 04:18:59.280]   is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar,
[04:18:59.280 --> 04:19:01.620]   although that's one way one could do it,
[04:19:01.620 --> 04:19:04.280]   but that the progression actually can arrive
[04:19:04.280 --> 04:19:06.260]   through this really extensive kit
[04:19:06.260 --> 04:19:08.280]   of changing the speed of movement,
[04:19:08.280 --> 04:19:12.320]   changing the number of sets, adding some volume,
[04:19:12.320 --> 04:19:14.040]   maybe changing the split so that you go
[04:19:14.040 --> 04:19:16.880]   from a three day a week full body workout
[04:19:16.880 --> 04:19:21.840]   to more of a body parts, one or two body parts per day,
[04:19:21.840 --> 04:19:23.880]   every other day or two on one off it,
[04:19:23.880 --> 04:19:25.840]   any number of different variations that are out there.
[04:19:25.840 --> 04:19:28.040]   Sounds like all of these can and will work
[04:19:28.040 --> 04:19:31.140]   provided that people are obeying the general principles
[04:19:31.140 --> 04:19:36.040]   of this hypertrophy adaptation inducing protocol
[04:19:36.040 --> 04:19:39.160]   that you described and that they are meeting the necessary,
[04:19:39.160 --> 04:19:42.240]   but not sufficient variables as well,
[04:19:42.240 --> 04:19:46.380]   such as sleep, nutrition and managing the stress
[04:19:46.380 --> 04:19:47.680]   in the rest of their life.
[04:19:47.680 --> 04:19:50.080]   Do I have that correctly?
[04:19:50.080 --> 04:19:52.080]   - Yeah, that's really, really good.
[04:19:52.080 --> 04:19:55.320]   One more thing I'd like to add is this is a situation
[04:19:55.320 --> 04:19:58.080]   for hypertrophy in which there are some exercises
[04:19:58.080 --> 04:20:00.000]   that I actually don't think are good ideas.
[04:20:00.000 --> 04:20:01.440]   So I want to make sure we included those
[04:20:01.440 --> 04:20:02.800]   in the conversation.
[04:20:02.800 --> 04:20:04.880]   That's not necessarily the case for strength.
[04:20:04.880 --> 04:20:07.000]   You can really do kind of whatever you want.
[04:20:07.000 --> 04:20:10.680]   And that is specifically plyometrics.
[04:20:10.680 --> 04:20:12.720]   Although in fact, if you look at,
[04:20:12.720 --> 04:20:14.440]   there's a recent review paper came out showing
[04:20:14.440 --> 04:20:17.520]   that plyometrics are effective as well for hypertrophy.
[04:20:17.520 --> 04:20:19.520]   - Seems like one can do almost anything
[04:20:19.520 --> 04:20:21.960]   as long as it falls within this parameter set.
[04:20:21.960 --> 04:20:23.880]   - The concepts are few and the methods are many.
[04:20:23.880 --> 04:20:27.840]   And the methods for hypertrophy are many, many.
[04:20:27.840 --> 04:20:30.620]   In general though, plyometrics are not my first, second
[04:20:30.620 --> 04:20:34.440]   or even like hundredth choice for hypertrophy.
[04:20:34.440 --> 04:20:36.040]   If they're a part of a total training program
[04:20:36.040 --> 04:20:38.880]   and you get some hypertrophy as a result, cool,
[04:20:38.880 --> 04:20:40.920]   you're lucky, not the first place I'm going.
[04:20:40.920 --> 04:20:43.520]   The other major category are weightlifting variations.
[04:20:43.520 --> 04:20:44.720]   So then when I'm saying weightlifting,
[04:20:44.720 --> 04:20:46.800]   I mean specifically Olympic weightlifting
[04:20:46.800 --> 04:20:49.220]   as in snatch, clean and jerk and their variations.
[04:20:49.220 --> 04:20:51.220]   Those are just not a good exercise choice.
[04:20:51.220 --> 04:20:53.200]   It's not that they don't work.
[04:20:53.200 --> 04:20:55.800]   It's just the risk to benefit ratio starts to fall
[04:20:55.800 --> 04:20:58.200]   pretty fast in the negative favor.
[04:20:58.200 --> 04:21:00.880]   And so it's just not worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch
[04:21:00.880 --> 04:21:03.160]   unless you're in a sport where that's like the competition
[04:21:03.160 --> 04:21:04.000]   or whatever.
[04:21:04.000 --> 04:21:05.800]   But if the goal is simply hypertrophy,
[04:21:05.800 --> 04:21:08.160]   choose different exercises than that.
[04:21:08.160 --> 04:21:09.340]   - Great.
[04:21:09.340 --> 04:21:12.360]   Now I realize that we are going to do entire episodes
[04:21:12.360 --> 04:21:15.440]   related to nutrition, supplementation, recovery, et cetera.
[04:21:15.440 --> 04:21:19.620]   But I'd like to just touch on two or three specific topics
[04:21:19.620 --> 04:21:21.360]   and questions that come up a lot
[04:21:21.360 --> 04:21:26.060]   around the question of hypertrophy specifically.
[04:21:26.060 --> 04:21:29.380]   And that probably also relate to strength training
[04:21:29.380 --> 04:21:31.660]   and training for speed.
[04:21:31.660 --> 04:21:34.980]   So I'm going to ask these in, not rapid fire.
[04:21:34.980 --> 04:21:37.220]   - Sure, I'll give you shorter answers, we'll put it that way.
[04:21:37.220 --> 04:21:38.660]   - So I will ask these questions now,
[04:21:38.660 --> 04:21:41.300]   but with the caveat that we will get into these topics
[04:21:41.300 --> 04:21:44.520]   in much more depth very soon.
[04:21:44.520 --> 04:21:47.280]   The first question is about the use of cold showers
[04:21:47.280 --> 04:21:49.740]   and ice baths and cold water exposure,
[04:21:49.740 --> 04:21:52.660]   which I know many people use for resilience training
[04:21:52.660 --> 04:21:56.860]   to increase their dopamine, which it does and for recovery.
[04:21:56.860 --> 04:22:01.860]   But there's also this issue of when one should use cold,
[04:22:01.860 --> 04:22:04.600]   that is deliberate cold exposure
[04:22:04.600 --> 04:22:08.080]   relative to hypertrophy training specifically.
[04:22:08.080 --> 04:22:12.160]   And that's because I've heard that
[04:22:12.160 --> 04:22:14.560]   if deliberate cold exposure is done too soon
[04:22:14.560 --> 04:22:19.320]   after a hypertrophy adaptation inducing workout,
[04:22:19.320 --> 04:22:20.900]   all the sorts of things we've been talking about,
[04:22:20.900 --> 04:22:23.700]   that the hypertrophy response can be blunted,
[04:22:23.700 --> 04:22:24.880]   reduced or eliminated.
[04:22:24.880 --> 04:22:25.740]   Is that true?
[04:22:25.740 --> 04:22:30.500]   And if so, when could people do deliberate cold exposure
[04:22:30.500 --> 04:22:32.540]   while still also including hypertrophy training
[04:22:32.540 --> 04:22:35.540]   in their program and still get hypertrophy?
[04:22:35.540 --> 04:22:38.200]   - Great, so you know I'm a lover of the cold.
[04:22:38.200 --> 04:22:41.340]   I still have a deep freezer in my house
[04:22:41.340 --> 04:22:43.000]   that is filled with water at all times
[04:22:43.000 --> 04:22:45.120]   that is plugged in and is a frozen chamber.
[04:22:45.120 --> 04:22:46.860]   I still do the old school style of it.
[04:22:46.860 --> 04:22:48.540]   - Please unplug it before you get in it each time.
[04:22:48.540 --> 04:22:50.580]   - Oh yes, absolutely.
[04:22:50.580 --> 04:22:51.880]   And then don't do it by yourself
[04:22:51.880 --> 04:22:53.320]   so that the lid can close on top of you
[04:22:53.320 --> 04:22:55.880]   and then we don't see you sort of ever again.
[04:22:55.880 --> 04:22:56.880]   - The Han Solo effect.
[04:22:56.880 --> 04:22:57.800]   - It's time for me to upgrade,
[04:22:57.800 --> 04:22:58.980]   get one of these new fancy ones,
[04:22:58.980 --> 04:23:00.680]   but I've been using this for so many years.
[04:23:00.680 --> 04:23:02.040]   So I love it.
[04:23:02.040 --> 04:23:06.240]   Obviously I've been involved with XPT and Gabby and Laird
[04:23:06.240 --> 04:23:07.920]   and Brian McKenzie and these folks.
[04:23:07.920 --> 04:23:09.880]   So I've been doing this stuff for a long time
[04:23:09.880 --> 04:23:11.900]   but I don't even know how many hundreds of folks
[04:23:11.900 --> 04:23:13.260]   into the ice and a lot of reasons.
[04:23:13.260 --> 04:23:14.540]   So there are a lot of benefits
[04:23:14.540 --> 04:23:16.640]   and we could talk about those later.
[04:23:16.640 --> 04:23:19.920]   However, that being said, it is very, very true.
[04:23:19.920 --> 04:23:23.280]   You do not want to get in the ice post hypertrophy training.
[04:23:23.280 --> 04:23:25.020]   You wouldn't want to do that immediately after the workout.
[04:23:25.020 --> 04:23:26.720]   You probably don't want to do it before the workout
[04:23:26.720 --> 04:23:29.220]   and you probably don't even want to do it that same day.
[04:23:29.220 --> 04:23:30.340]   It is just not worth it.
[04:23:30.340 --> 04:23:32.860]   It will blunt hypertrophy in specifically,
[04:23:32.860 --> 04:23:35.980]   we've talked earlier about what's driving muscle growth
[04:23:35.980 --> 04:23:39.740]   is that signaling cascade through that gene expression,
[04:23:39.740 --> 04:23:41.620]   through that muscle protein synthesis.
[04:23:41.620 --> 04:23:43.500]   Cold exposure blocks that signal.
[04:23:43.500 --> 04:23:47.220]   Remember, adaptation comes from stress.
[04:23:47.220 --> 04:23:49.900]   You've put in a stressor in, now you've blocked that stress.
[04:23:49.900 --> 04:23:51.880]   You've literally blocked the signal
[04:23:51.880 --> 04:23:54.780]   that tells your body come back and grow larger size.
[04:23:54.780 --> 04:23:56.660]   So not a good idea to do it.
[04:23:56.660 --> 04:23:58.760]   If you're training for some other purposes,
[04:23:58.760 --> 04:24:00.260]   there may be strength.
[04:24:00.260 --> 04:24:04.140]   Maybe there's an argument there, although maybe not.
[04:24:04.140 --> 04:24:05.680]   For speed and power, maybe you can get away with it.
[04:24:05.680 --> 04:24:07.740]   Endurance, maybe a separate conversation.
[04:24:07.740 --> 04:24:09.820]   If you're in season,
[04:24:09.820 --> 04:24:12.620]   I have no problem using it immediately after a game.
[04:24:12.620 --> 04:24:13.900]   The goal is entirely different.
[04:24:13.900 --> 04:24:16.220]   Even if we did a hypertrophy type of training program,
[04:24:16.220 --> 04:24:18.620]   we're not doing it to try to maximize growth.
[04:24:18.620 --> 04:24:22.180]   In that particular case, our priority for recovery
[04:24:22.180 --> 04:24:24.840]   is higher than our priority for muscle growth,
[04:24:24.840 --> 04:24:27.700]   so we choose optimization in that category.
[04:24:27.700 --> 04:24:29.360]   You can only make those choices though
[04:24:29.360 --> 04:24:32.100]   when you truly understand what is the goal for the day,
[04:24:32.100 --> 04:24:33.960]   the week, the month, the phase of training,
[04:24:33.960 --> 04:24:35.540]   and really what part of the year you're in.
[04:24:35.540 --> 04:24:38.460]   We have that all plotted out for all the people we work with
[04:24:38.460 --> 04:24:41.420]   so I know when we wanna choose one over the other.
[04:24:41.420 --> 04:24:43.340]   It's not a, this is the choice you always make,
[04:24:43.340 --> 04:24:45.960]   the situation, that's just not how we operate.
[04:24:45.960 --> 04:24:47.420]   We need more precision in that.
[04:24:47.420 --> 04:24:50.040]   So that being said, we're generally not going to do it.
[04:24:50.040 --> 04:24:52.900]   If we want to do a lot of icing during a phase
[04:24:52.900 --> 04:24:56.220]   in which we're using a lot of hypertrophy,
[04:24:56.220 --> 04:24:57.260]   we're gonna do a couple of things.
[04:24:57.260 --> 04:24:59.020]   Number one, we may just not use it.
[04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:00.820]   So there are phases in our training
[04:25:00.820 --> 04:25:03.320]   where I don't wanna maximize recovery.
[04:25:03.320 --> 04:25:04.940]   I'm not gonna give you any tricks here.
[04:25:04.940 --> 04:25:07.020]   I'm not gonna do ice or any of the other methods
[04:25:07.020 --> 04:25:08.460]   we're gonna talk about, why?
[04:25:08.460 --> 04:25:12.320]   Because the whole point is to cause overload.
[04:25:12.320 --> 04:25:14.460]   That's what's gonna be the stimuli to cause adaptation.
[04:25:14.460 --> 04:25:16.420]   If all I'm doing is blocking that stuff,
[04:25:16.420 --> 04:25:18.300]   attenuating it, smashing it back down,
[04:25:18.300 --> 04:25:19.700]   I'm undercutting myself.
[04:25:19.700 --> 04:25:22.020]   I'm choosing to feel a little bit better,
[04:25:22.020 --> 04:25:24.700]   to have a little bit better performance right now,
[04:25:24.700 --> 04:25:26.620]   knowing that's going to compromise the results,
[04:25:26.620 --> 04:25:29.660]   I'm going to get six, eight, 10, 12 weeks from now.
[04:25:29.660 --> 04:25:30.980]   So I'm not gonna choose at all.
[04:25:30.980 --> 04:25:32.100]   And the reality of it is,
[04:25:32.100 --> 04:25:34.800]   if I really am trying to maximize hypertrophy,
[04:25:34.800 --> 04:25:36.260]   I'm probably not doing any ice work
[04:25:36.260 --> 04:25:37.480]   during that whole phase.
[04:25:37.480 --> 04:25:38.860]   Maybe like my off day.
[04:25:38.860 --> 04:25:40.640]   I know that's similar to a setup you have,
[04:25:40.640 --> 04:25:42.780]   like one day a week when I'm not training,
[04:25:42.780 --> 04:25:43.680]   we'll jump in some ice,
[04:25:43.680 --> 04:25:46.340]   maybe even do some hot cold contrast.
[04:25:46.340 --> 04:25:48.820]   I love the XPT protocol.
[04:25:48.820 --> 04:25:50.980]   We've probably talked about it before.
[04:25:50.980 --> 04:25:54.580]   That's a great setup or just not do it at all.
[04:25:54.580 --> 04:25:56.420]   It's just not something we need.
[04:25:56.420 --> 04:25:58.360]   When we move into another phase of training
[04:25:58.360 --> 04:26:00.620]   where we're trying to maximize adaptation
[04:26:00.620 --> 04:26:02.080]   or maximize the result
[04:26:02.080 --> 04:26:04.300]   and get the benefit of that training,
[04:26:04.300 --> 04:26:06.420]   now we're going to hedge more towards recovery
[04:26:06.420 --> 04:26:08.140]   and we're going to bring in some of these strategies
[04:26:08.140 --> 04:26:10.000]   and techniques and not worry about
[04:26:10.000 --> 04:26:11.420]   causing the most stimuli there
[04:26:11.420 --> 04:26:15.540]   'cause we're trying to actualize the work we did
[04:26:15.540 --> 04:26:17.600]   six, eight, 10, 12 weeks before.
[04:26:17.600 --> 04:26:18.960]   - What about cold showers?
[04:26:18.960 --> 04:26:21.640]   Do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect?
[04:26:21.640 --> 04:26:22.700]   - In general, no.
[04:26:22.700 --> 04:26:24.240]   In general, you can do cold showers.
[04:26:24.240 --> 04:26:25.380]   That's not going to be a problem.
[04:26:25.380 --> 04:26:26.600]   You're not going to be in there very long
[04:26:26.600 --> 04:26:28.860]   and you're not going to get nearly as cold
[04:26:28.860 --> 04:26:32.840]   as you will submerged in 30 degree ice water.
[04:26:32.840 --> 04:26:34.600]   Like the way that we do it nonetheless.
[04:26:34.600 --> 04:26:36.900]   So I have no problem standing in the shower
[04:26:36.900 --> 04:26:39.640]   for a couple of minutes using it for other reasons
[04:26:39.640 --> 04:26:41.500]   if you want to, that's no issue.
[04:26:41.500 --> 04:26:43.340]   - I'd like to talk a little bit about nutrition
[04:26:43.340 --> 04:26:47.060]   and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy.
[04:26:47.060 --> 04:26:50.320]   Dr. Layne Norton, who's been a guest
[04:26:50.320 --> 04:26:53.080]   on the Huberman Lab podcast and we both know,
[04:26:53.080 --> 04:26:58.080]   throughout a number range related to protein intake
[04:26:58.080 --> 04:27:01.620]   on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis can occur
[04:27:01.620 --> 04:27:04.980]   by meal, across the day, et cetera.
[04:27:04.980 --> 04:27:07.260]   A lot of research done there and some important work
[04:27:07.260 --> 04:27:08.500]   by him in particular.
[04:27:08.500 --> 04:27:13.060]   And then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams
[04:27:13.060 --> 04:27:16.880]   per kilogram of body weight being the lower end of the range
[04:27:16.880 --> 04:27:19.760]   up to, I believe it was as high as 2.4,
[04:27:19.760 --> 04:27:23.940]   maybe even as high as 2.7 grams of protein
[04:27:23.940 --> 04:27:25.740]   per kilogram of body weight per day.
[04:27:25.740 --> 04:27:29.660]   That's a pretty broad range, but it's on the higher end
[04:27:29.660 --> 04:27:31.220]   of what I think most people think of
[04:27:31.220 --> 04:27:33.100]   in terms of protein intake.
[04:27:33.100 --> 04:27:35.300]   And then again, some people might already be right there
[04:27:35.300 --> 04:27:36.980]   or maybe even above that value.
[04:27:36.980 --> 04:27:38.680]   Of course, this all depends on whether or not
[04:27:38.680 --> 04:27:43.680]   people are omnivore, vegan, meat-based, et cetera.
[04:27:43.680 --> 04:27:45.440]   We won't even go there.
[04:27:45.440 --> 04:27:48.300]   But assuming people are getting enough protein per day,
[04:27:48.300 --> 04:27:51.140]   so somewhere in that range, and they are spreading out
[04:27:51.140 --> 04:27:54.580]   that protein intake to accommodate the fact
[04:27:54.580 --> 04:27:57.780]   that the body can only assimilate a certain amount
[04:27:57.780 --> 04:27:59.340]   of protein in any given sitting.
[04:28:00.260 --> 04:28:04.540]   What do you like to see people ingest at some point
[04:28:04.540 --> 04:28:09.540]   post-hypertrophy-inducing workout in order to get
[04:28:09.540 --> 04:28:14.780]   the protein synthesis advantage, if you will,
[04:28:14.780 --> 04:28:17.620]   that is stimulated by that workout?
[04:28:17.620 --> 04:28:20.820]   Earlier, you mentioned the post-training feeding window
[04:28:20.820 --> 04:28:22.940]   that in the '90s and probably earlier,
[04:28:22.940 --> 04:28:25.020]   people were talking about, oh, within the first 90 minutes,
[04:28:25.020 --> 04:28:26.300]   you have to get 30 minutes-- - It was 30 minutes
[04:28:26.300 --> 04:28:27.580]   for a while, yeah. - Oh, was it?
[04:28:27.580 --> 04:28:30.120]   30 minutes of, excuse me, a certain number of grams
[04:28:30.120 --> 04:28:32.060]   of carbohydrate and protein, et cetera.
[04:28:32.060 --> 04:28:33.980]   I think now the understanding is that that window
[04:28:33.980 --> 04:28:38.620]   is much broader, and how broad, et cetera,
[04:28:38.620 --> 04:28:40.060]   is still a matter of debate.
[04:28:40.060 --> 04:28:43.880]   But when somebody is training specifically for hypertrophy,
[04:28:43.880 --> 04:28:45.540]   assuming they are getting enough protein
[04:28:45.540 --> 04:28:48.300]   from quality sources in their other meals,
[04:28:48.300 --> 04:28:51.900]   and assuming that their overall macronutrient intake
[04:28:51.900 --> 04:28:53.760]   and caloric intake is high enough,
[04:28:53.760 --> 04:28:55.480]   that is, they have enough of a caloric surplus
[04:28:55.480 --> 04:28:59.980]   that they have the raw materials for hypertrophy.
[04:28:59.980 --> 04:29:05.260]   What do you like to see people ingest at some point
[04:29:05.260 --> 04:29:07.300]   post-workout in order to facilitate
[04:29:07.300 --> 04:29:09.700]   muscle protein synthesis and recovery?
[04:29:09.700 --> 04:29:12.060]   And this could include nutrition and supplementation,
[04:29:12.060 --> 04:29:14.520]   or if you want to divide those answers out,
[04:29:14.520 --> 04:29:15.460]   feel free to do so, of course.
[04:29:15.460 --> 04:29:16.300]   - Yeah, okay, great.
[04:29:16.300 --> 04:29:18.800]   So a ton of work came out of Don Lehman's lab,
[04:29:18.800 --> 04:29:20.560]   was actually Lane's mentor,
[04:29:20.560 --> 04:29:22.660]   as well as Stu Phillips at McMaster.
[04:29:22.660 --> 04:29:24.460]   So a ton of work there, and we can answer
[04:29:24.460 --> 04:29:25.880]   a number of things here.
[04:29:25.880 --> 04:29:28.580]   So Lane's numbers that he recommended,
[04:29:28.580 --> 04:29:30.740]   also known as about a gram of protein
[04:29:30.740 --> 04:29:31.740]   per pound of body weight.
[04:29:31.740 --> 04:29:32.940]   It's a great start.
[04:29:32.940 --> 04:29:34.780]   Now, once you slide below that--
[04:29:34.780 --> 04:29:35.720]   - That's per pound, right?
[04:29:35.720 --> 04:29:36.780]   - One gram per pound.
[04:29:36.780 --> 04:29:38.880]   - Right, and earlier, just to make sure,
[04:29:38.880 --> 04:29:40.300]   'cause we're changing units here,
[04:29:40.300 --> 04:29:44.640]   it was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight,
[04:29:44.640 --> 04:29:46.760]   all the way up to, I think it was 2.4,
[04:29:46.760 --> 04:29:49.620]   but maybe as high as 2.7 grams of protein
[04:29:49.620 --> 04:29:50.900]   per kilogram of body weight.
[04:29:50.900 --> 04:29:53.780]   - So 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing.
[04:29:53.780 --> 04:29:55.460]   - So 2.2 grams per kilogram is the same
[04:29:55.460 --> 04:29:56.540]   as one gram per pound.
[04:29:56.540 --> 04:29:57.380]   - Right.
[04:29:57.380 --> 04:30:00.300]   - So depending on where you're listening to this at,
[04:30:00.300 --> 04:30:02.860]   one of those may be easier than the other for you.
[04:30:02.860 --> 04:30:05.500]   If you start getting below that number,
[04:30:05.500 --> 04:30:07.660]   now you do start running into questions
[04:30:07.660 --> 04:30:10.900]   of protein quality, protein type, and protein timing.
[04:30:10.900 --> 04:30:12.900]   This is one of the reasons why I actually fully agree
[04:30:12.900 --> 04:30:15.820]   with Lane, is just get that number higher than you think,
[04:30:15.820 --> 04:30:18.220]   and then all those other variables don't matter.
[04:30:18.220 --> 04:30:20.220]   If that number is low, then you need to start
[04:30:20.220 --> 04:30:21.980]   paying attention to a bunch of other stuff.
[04:30:21.980 --> 04:30:24.580]   You've added now complexity to your program,
[04:30:24.580 --> 04:30:26.320]   things you've got to pay attention to.
[04:30:26.320 --> 04:30:27.980]   Just stay high and it doesn't matter.
[04:30:27.980 --> 04:30:29.420]   And so you can just leave a lot of those things
[04:30:29.420 --> 04:30:30.820]   off the table.
[04:30:30.820 --> 04:30:32.820]   That seems to be fairly clear in the work
[04:30:32.820 --> 04:30:34.280]   of some of these gentlemen I just mentioned,
[04:30:34.280 --> 04:30:36.300]   that as long as you get to that total number,
[04:30:36.300 --> 04:30:39.520]   the question about timing and types and quality,
[04:30:39.520 --> 04:30:40.740]   it seems to matter a lot less.
[04:30:40.740 --> 04:30:44.900]   In fact, Stu's recent work in non-animal-based proteins
[04:30:44.900 --> 04:30:46.700]   really showed that, to be fairly clear,
[04:30:46.700 --> 04:30:47.780]   that those are quite effective,
[04:30:47.780 --> 04:30:51.260]   assuming total protein intake is high enough.
[04:30:51.260 --> 04:30:53.380]   The amount of leucine and other amino acids
[04:30:53.380 --> 04:30:55.260]   in those actual proteins matter less
[04:30:55.260 --> 04:30:57.460]   if the total threshold is just super high.
[04:30:57.460 --> 04:30:59.280]   So just do that and you're fine.
[04:30:59.280 --> 04:31:01.300]   Now, the other caveat we have to say here
[04:31:01.300 --> 04:31:04.580]   is timing of macronutrients seems to be
[04:31:04.580 --> 04:31:06.040]   somewhat irrelevant for protein,
[04:31:06.040 --> 04:31:08.660]   but that is not the case for carbohydrates.
[04:31:08.660 --> 04:31:10.220]   So that timing does matter.
[04:31:10.220 --> 04:31:13.420]   Replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific,
[04:31:13.420 --> 04:31:15.900]   and you want to make sure that that is around a lot
[04:31:15.900 --> 04:31:18.580]   if you're doing either maintaining training quality
[04:31:18.580 --> 04:31:20.600]   or you're sliding into endurance type of work.
[04:31:20.600 --> 04:31:23.580]   And so nutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates,
[04:31:23.580 --> 04:31:26.780]   maybe less so with protein and certainly less so with protein
[04:31:26.780 --> 04:31:29.520]   if the total protein ingestion is high enough.
[04:31:29.520 --> 04:31:32.800]   So it depends on what we're going after
[04:31:32.800 --> 04:31:34.820]   in terms of a training goal
[04:31:34.820 --> 04:31:36.960]   and where we want to get with all these things.
[04:31:36.960 --> 04:31:39.960]   In general, the way that we like to think about this is
[04:31:39.960 --> 04:31:42.120]   if you're doing a strength type of work
[04:31:42.120 --> 04:31:43.700]   where you're truly targeting that,
[04:31:43.700 --> 04:31:47.740]   then a one-to-one post-exercise protein-to-carbohydrate ratio
[04:31:47.740 --> 04:31:49.040]   is generally what we're going to go after.
[04:31:49.040 --> 04:31:51.340]   So this would be something like 35 grams of protein
[04:31:51.340 --> 04:31:53.540]   and 35 grams of carbohydrate.
[04:31:53.540 --> 04:31:55.940]   It doesn't have to be post, it can be pre,
[04:31:55.940 --> 04:31:58.660]   or my favorite is actually mid or post,
[04:31:58.660 --> 04:32:00.080]   but somewhere in that range,
[04:32:00.080 --> 04:32:01.640]   especially if you're training in the morning
[04:32:01.640 --> 04:32:04.460]   and you have not consumed anything prior to your workout.
[04:32:04.460 --> 04:32:06.060]   - And that's not necessarily eating in the middle
[04:32:06.060 --> 04:32:07.940]   of the workout that's drinking calories.
[04:32:07.940 --> 04:32:08.780]   - Yeah, it's going to be a-
[04:32:08.780 --> 04:32:12.060]   - I have to see someone eating a sandwich in the gym,
[04:32:12.060 --> 04:32:13.540]   although I'm sure it's happened.
[04:32:13.540 --> 04:32:14.380]   - Yeah.
[04:32:14.380 --> 04:32:17.540]   So one-to-one is that like sort of standard number here.
[04:32:18.580 --> 04:32:20.000]   If you're going to do sort of more
[04:32:20.000 --> 04:32:22.400]   of a really hard conditioning workout,
[04:32:22.400 --> 04:32:24.680]   that number slides up to something like three
[04:32:24.680 --> 04:32:25.880]   or even four-to-one,
[04:32:25.880 --> 04:32:28.200]   which would be carbohydrate-to-protein ratio.
[04:32:28.200 --> 04:32:30.520]   So if we want to stay at 35 grams of protein,
[04:32:30.520 --> 04:32:32.160]   we're going to go maybe as high as like 100
[04:32:32.160 --> 04:32:34.600]   or 140 grams of carbohydrate,
[04:32:34.600 --> 04:32:36.880]   again, depending on what type of training
[04:32:36.880 --> 04:32:37.740]   we're sort of doing.
[04:32:37.740 --> 04:32:40.000]   If you're going to do a little bit of a combination,
[04:32:40.000 --> 04:32:41.660]   then you, like a little bit of strength,
[04:32:41.660 --> 04:32:43.700]   a little bit of conditioning and kind of a standard workout,
[04:32:43.700 --> 04:32:45.960]   which is probably something that a lot of people will do,
[04:32:45.960 --> 04:32:48.260]   then you maybe want to go to something like two-to-one.
[04:32:48.260 --> 04:32:51.120]   So, you know, 35 grams of protein,
[04:32:51.120 --> 04:32:53.280]   60, 70 grams of carbohydrate.
[04:32:53.280 --> 04:32:54.960]   And those are kind of just like rough numbers
[04:32:54.960 --> 04:32:56.520]   that you can go by.
[04:32:56.520 --> 04:32:59.240]   - And for pure hypertrophy training,
[04:32:59.240 --> 04:33:01.560]   would you like to see people ingest some carbohydrate
[04:33:01.560 --> 04:33:02.560]   post-training?
[04:33:02.560 --> 04:33:04.200]   - For pure hypertrophy training,
[04:33:04.200 --> 04:33:07.440]   I want to see that as many of those nutrients
[04:33:07.440 --> 04:33:09.400]   around the training as generally possible.
[04:33:09.400 --> 04:33:10.800]   Now, again, I may change my mind
[04:33:10.800 --> 04:33:12.000]   when our fasting study comes out,
[04:33:12.000 --> 04:33:13.320]   but as it stands now,
[04:33:14.760 --> 04:33:19.740]   there is no advantage to not fueling around the training.
[04:33:19.740 --> 04:33:21.300]   And there are some known
[04:33:21.300 --> 04:33:23.640]   and some other potential advantages to fueling.
[04:33:23.640 --> 04:33:26.540]   So I just see no reason to not do it.
[04:33:26.540 --> 04:33:29.860]   In fact, most people are generally going to do better.
[04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:31.380]   Now, this is not science.
[04:33:31.380 --> 04:33:33.520]   This is just my coaching experience.
[04:33:33.520 --> 04:33:34.860]   And this is with our athletes
[04:33:34.860 --> 04:33:37.100]   and all of our non-athletes that we've worked with
[04:33:37.100 --> 04:33:38.260]   and do work with.
[04:33:38.260 --> 04:33:40.220]   They're just going to be better spreading those meals out
[04:33:40.220 --> 04:33:41.620]   generally throughout the day.
[04:33:41.620 --> 04:33:43.060]   And they're going to be better
[04:33:43.060 --> 04:33:46.100]   if they have those nutrients either pre, mid, or post.
[04:33:46.100 --> 04:33:48.600]   And so they're going to get, even for hypertrophy,
[04:33:48.600 --> 04:33:49.600]   they're going to get something like
[04:33:49.600 --> 04:33:52.060]   that three to one ratio of carbs to protein.
[04:33:52.060 --> 04:33:53.980]   Personal preference.
[04:33:53.980 --> 04:33:55.400]   Some people don't like to eat before they train.
[04:33:55.400 --> 04:33:57.140]   Some people have to eat before they train.
[04:33:57.140 --> 04:34:01.360]   Some people can't put food in their belly immediately after.
[04:34:01.360 --> 04:34:02.200]   Work around that.
[04:34:02.200 --> 04:34:03.660]   You can play based on personal preference,
[04:34:03.660 --> 04:34:05.960]   but we want that fueling in there
[04:34:05.960 --> 04:34:07.880]   because we want to maximize the potential growth
[04:34:07.880 --> 04:34:10.240]   and we want to just get a jumpstart on recovery
[04:34:10.240 --> 04:34:12.840]   because we're going to be training again pretty soon.
[04:34:13.480 --> 04:34:15.280]   - Supplementation is a huge topic
[04:34:15.280 --> 04:34:18.200]   and one that we will go into in great depth
[04:34:18.200 --> 04:34:22.240]   in a soon to occur episode.
[04:34:22.240 --> 04:34:24.800]   But if you had to pick one supplement
[04:34:24.800 --> 04:34:28.620]   that can benefit most everybody, if not everybody,
[04:34:28.620 --> 04:34:32.280]   for their training directed toward strength,
[04:34:32.280 --> 04:34:35.200]   power, and hypertrophy, what would that supplement be?
[04:34:35.200 --> 04:34:37.080]   And how would you like to see people use it?
[04:34:37.080 --> 04:34:39.160]   Meaning how much should they take
[04:34:39.160 --> 04:34:41.080]   and when should they take it?
[04:34:41.080 --> 04:34:41.920]   - Sure.
[04:34:41.920 --> 04:34:44.560]   If you don't count protein and carbohydrates as supplements,
[04:34:44.560 --> 04:34:46.740]   they technically are, but we'll just walk out of that.
[04:34:46.740 --> 04:34:47.580]   - Right, sorry.
[04:34:47.580 --> 04:34:48.620]   I should be more specific.
[04:34:48.620 --> 04:34:53.620]   I'm not referring to a non-food form protein and carbohydrate.
[04:34:53.620 --> 04:34:57.940]   So powdered protein and powdered carbohydrate, et cetera,
[04:34:57.940 --> 04:34:59.920]   technically are supplements.
[04:34:59.920 --> 04:35:02.760]   They're highly processed, but I'm not including that.
[04:35:02.760 --> 04:35:06.600]   I'm referring to non-macronutrient type supplements.
[04:35:06.600 --> 04:35:07.440]   - Yeah.
[04:35:07.440 --> 04:35:08.520]   Does testosterone count?
[04:35:10.480 --> 04:35:12.200]   Well, in the context of this discussion,
[04:35:12.200 --> 04:35:14.860]   it's testosterone that people are manufacturing themselves.
[04:35:14.860 --> 04:35:15.840]   - Ah, okay.
[04:35:15.840 --> 04:35:17.280]   The cheating kind, the endogenous kind.
[04:35:17.280 --> 04:35:20.940]   No, I mean, creatine is the answer here without question.
[04:35:20.940 --> 04:35:24.360]   It is the most well studied.
[04:35:24.360 --> 04:35:28.320]   It is the most effective and its benefits are robust,
[04:35:28.320 --> 04:35:32.320]   meaning they're going to confer positive adaptations
[04:35:32.320 --> 04:35:34.640]   across multiple physiological domains.
[04:35:34.640 --> 04:35:36.720]   So we could certainly have a very long chat
[04:35:36.720 --> 04:35:39.120]   about some of the interesting things that people,
[04:35:39.120 --> 04:35:41.620]   in fact, we just had Darren Kandao
[04:35:41.620 --> 04:35:43.060]   on our Barbell Shrugged podcast,
[04:35:43.060 --> 04:35:44.880]   and he went into extensive detail
[04:35:44.880 --> 04:35:46.200]   about all the benefits of creatine
[04:35:46.200 --> 04:35:47.800]   that people have no idea about,
[04:35:47.800 --> 04:35:49.980]   including things like bone mineral density.
[04:35:49.980 --> 04:35:51.160]   You asked about that earlier.
[04:35:51.160 --> 04:35:53.800]   Creatine is actually fairly effective for that,
[04:35:53.800 --> 04:35:57.520]   let alone the benefit in things like cognitive function,
[04:35:57.520 --> 04:35:59.660]   decision-making, memory,
[04:35:59.660 --> 04:36:01.080]   the work that's being done there
[04:36:01.080 --> 04:36:05.980]   for neurological disorders, depression,
[04:36:05.980 --> 04:36:08.640]   a whole host of things that creatine is being studied for.
[04:36:08.640 --> 04:36:11.960]   Some of those studies show a lot of benefits,
[04:36:11.960 --> 04:36:14.280]   some of it show maybe a little bit, some none,
[04:36:14.280 --> 04:36:17.040]   but there's just a lot of things creatine can do.
[04:36:17.040 --> 04:36:18.780]   So when we could talk about muscle recovery
[04:36:18.780 --> 04:36:19.920]   or muscle hypertrophy,
[04:36:19.920 --> 04:36:23.080]   that's where the bulk of the research is,
[04:36:23.080 --> 04:36:25.040]   and it's very effective.
[04:36:25.040 --> 04:36:27.200]   In terms of type,
[04:36:27.200 --> 04:36:29.680]   creatine monohydrate is still the best one,
[04:36:29.680 --> 04:36:32.440]   and that's just because it has the largest evidence base.
[04:36:32.440 --> 04:36:34.880]   You can maybe make some arguments for some other types,
[04:36:34.880 --> 04:36:37.460]   but you're really gonna reach saturation pretty quickly
[04:36:37.460 --> 04:36:39.660]   within a matter of weeks in there,
[04:36:39.660 --> 04:36:43.400]   at a dosage of anywhere between three to six grams per day.
[04:36:43.400 --> 04:36:47.000]   Now, five grams is the very standard number we give.
[04:36:47.000 --> 04:36:49.760]   Reality is I change that number based on size.
[04:36:49.760 --> 04:36:51.200]   That's just the honest truth.
[04:36:51.200 --> 04:36:53.720]   If you're 225 pounds,
[04:36:53.720 --> 04:36:54.960]   you're not gonna get the same dosage
[04:36:54.960 --> 04:36:57.300]   of creatine as a 125-pound girl.
[04:36:57.300 --> 04:36:58.840]   That's just like, this is not what we're gonna do.
[04:36:58.840 --> 04:37:01.100]   So we may slide that number down a little bit closer to three
[04:37:01.100 --> 04:37:03.120]   for the smaller, girl, boy, it doesn't matter,
[04:37:03.120 --> 04:37:05.200]   it's just physical size.
[04:37:05.200 --> 04:37:08.140]   If you're one of our 275 or 330-pound
[04:37:08.140 --> 04:37:10.700]   offensive right tackles in the NFL,
[04:37:10.700 --> 04:37:12.780]   you're not gonna get the same dosage as everybody else.
[04:37:12.780 --> 04:37:14.480]   So that number's gonna go up to seven, eight, nine,
[04:37:14.480 --> 04:37:16.180]   maybe even 10 grams a day.
[04:37:16.180 --> 04:37:17.260]   So that's just kind of the scale.
[04:37:17.260 --> 04:37:18.740]   In general, if you wanted an easy answer,
[04:37:18.740 --> 04:37:20.620]   five grams is the standard.
[04:37:20.620 --> 04:37:22.740]   - Taken after training?
[04:37:22.740 --> 04:37:24.160]   - The timing doesn't matter.
[04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:25.000]   Totally irrelevant.
[04:37:25.000 --> 04:37:26.360]   Take it in the morning with breakfast, take it at night,
[04:37:26.360 --> 04:37:28.140]   take it anytime you want, take it pre.
[04:37:28.140 --> 04:37:31.040]   We tend to put it in a lot of people's workout
[04:37:31.040 --> 04:37:34.860]   shakes just to make sure they get it in throughout the day.
[04:37:34.860 --> 04:37:36.460]   But the timing is irrelevant.
[04:37:36.460 --> 04:37:38.840]   - Great, well, thank you for that very informative answer.
[04:37:38.840 --> 04:37:41.540]   And I look forward to much more discussion
[04:37:41.540 --> 04:37:44.400]   about nutrition and supplementation and recovery
[04:37:44.400 --> 04:37:46.940]   and all the rest in the episodes to come.
[04:37:46.940 --> 04:37:48.540]   This was incredibly informative.
[04:37:48.540 --> 04:37:50.920]   Thank you so very much.
[04:37:50.920 --> 04:37:52.300]   - I appreciate the opportunity.
[04:37:52.300 --> 04:37:53.680]   I had a great time doing that.
[04:37:53.680 --> 04:37:55.580]   I love talking about these things.
[04:37:55.580 --> 04:37:57.500]   I also really liked talking about
[04:37:57.500 --> 04:37:59.280]   what we're gonna get into in our next conversation,
[04:37:59.280 --> 04:38:02.700]   which is the physiology of endurance, metabolism,
[04:38:02.700 --> 04:38:04.080]   and fat loss.
