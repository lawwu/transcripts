[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Monday we looked at doubt. Can we ever hope to experience a deepening joy in God during
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.420]   reoccurring seasons of doubt? And your answer, Pastor John, was yes. We can experience deepening
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.800]   joy in God during recurring seasons of doubt. And you explained how. And in the Monday episode,
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.400]   one of the battles you briefly mentioned was the battle when thoughts enter our minds that
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.680]   make us wonder whether something in the Bible, something the Bible teaches, is really true.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.440]   That's one form of doubt that we face as believers, and today we drill down into Bible doubt.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.920]   So how do we fight off this inner skeptic in our Bible reading? The frank and honest
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.560]   question comes from a listener named Kristen. "Pastor John, I'm ashamed to say that my Bible
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.760]   reading is often hijacked by a sense of doubt. It sometimes even feels more like a spiritual
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.640]   battle than an intellectual battle, and it scares me because it attacks my faith at the
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.680]   foundations—the truth of the Bible." Do you have any advice for attacking a spirit
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.200]   of doubt and cynicism when reading the Scriptures?
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.640]   You know, Tony, I pray, I stop and I pray over every one of these questions as I try
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.560]   to answer them so that in the hundreds of things you could say, "The Lord will help
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.440]   me choose the things that might be most helpful." This one felt like I needed to pray more because
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.320]   when she conceded that it's a spiritual battle and not just an intellectual one, I
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.240]   felt that's really true. And not just for her, but for all of us. The intellectual things
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.960]   that rise up that make the Bible seem problematic are often covering a satanic attack. The devil
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.520]   really hates the Bible. He hates truth. He's a deceiver from the beginning, and he can
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.040]   make things look merely intellectual when in fact some pretty heavy, heavy spiritual
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:18.000]   stuff is going on. So I'll just tell Kristen now what my—the answer is yes, I do have
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.040]   some advice, and I based every one of these six counsels on Scripture, and I'll mention
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.080]   the Scripture. So I'm praying for Kristen and lots of people who, when they read the
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.720]   Bible, find stumbling blocks that get in the way of their enjoyment and their belief. And
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.720]   one of these maybe, if not all of them, might prove from the Lord for her. Number one, pray
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:55.400]   that God would help you, that he would fight your doubts and cynicism with you and for
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.920]   you. In other words, cry out to God, "Fight for me. Help me defeat these obstacles."
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.600]   And we all know where that's coming from. Mark 9, 24, immediately, the father of the
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   child who had this epileptic fit that nobody could heal, and he said, "Do you want me
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.400]   to do anything here?" And the man said, "If you can." And she said, "What is
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.980]   'if' stuff?" And then the man cried out, "I believe. Help my unbelief."
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.240]   And that's a strange way to say it. Help your unbelief do what? Like die, that's
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   what. Which means that Kristen and I need to preface our Bible reading every day with
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:52.720]   prayer, "God help me with my unbelief." That is, kill it, destroy it, get at whatever's
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.880]   causing it. So prayer. Number two, seek in all your reading and praying in the Bible,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.200]   not just to know truth, but to see the glory of Christ. There is a spiritual light shining
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.320]   from Christ that is self-authenticating if you saw it. And I'm thinking here now of
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.080]   the doubting Thomas. I'm glad he exists and is in the Bible for Kristen and me. Then
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.280]   Jesus said to Thomas, remember, Thomas said, "I'm not gonna believe unless I have my
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.480]   finger in his side." Yeah.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.280]   And so Jesus showing up and he says, "Put your finger here and see my hands and put
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   out your hand and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." Thomas answered
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   him, "My Lord and my God." In other words, he did not touch him. He saw him. Something
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.560]   happened when he saw him. He thought that he would need to do more. He would need more
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.320]   evidence for a ghost. You know, he's gonna be a ghost. I'm gonna be tricked. And when
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   Jesus showed up, he didn't need any more. He didn't. He didn't have to push it to the
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.720]   limit of his evidential demands. And Jesus said, "Have you believed because you have
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.800]   seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed." And I think that means
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.200]   not seeing the way you've seen, but believed by the seeing that comes through the Word.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.400]   And so I'm saying to Kristen that when she reads, "Ask the Lord for this," this kind
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.800]   of not physical, but a spiritual discernment, a spiritual sight of Christ that is different
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.160]   than a kind of argument from evidences drawn with inferences.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   So number three, think much about the patience and mercy of God to doubters. Peter said,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.080]   "Lord, if it's you, command me to come to you on the water." He's gonna walk on water.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:17.040]   And Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came to
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:25.480]   Jesus. And then it says, this is Matthew 14, 30, "But when he saw the wind, he was afraid
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.560]   and beginning to sink. He cried out, 'Lord, save me.'" And Jesus did not say, "Tough,
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.320]   man. I don't want... What a jerk. I just told you you could do this and you were doing it."
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:45.280]   No, no, that is not what Jesus said or did. Jesus immediately reached out his hand and
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.480]   took hold of him saying, "Oh, you a little faith. Why did you doubt?" So meditate on
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:01.120]   the kindness and the patience of Jesus to doubters. So Peter's doubting and Jesus reaches
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.160]   out his hand. So maybe that's what Kristen would feel as she reads this. "He is reaching
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   out his hand to me in my doubt."
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.120]   Number four, seek out people of strong faith to read outside the Bible and to be around
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.800]   in person and make them your heroes. So Hebrews 13, 7, "Remember your leaders, those who spoke
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.680]   to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life. Imitate their faith."
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.520]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So he explicitly wants us to
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:48.160]   look to people who are ahead of us in this battle of faith and take heart from looking
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.560]   at the outcome of their faith. And here's another one in Hebrews. Hebrews seems to be
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.960]   really big on this communal nature of fighting the fight of faith. So Hebrews 3, 12, "Take
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.440]   care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving," you could say, "doubting
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.360]   heart leading you to fall away from the living God. Exhort one another every day as long
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.400]   as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:20.240]   In other words, we need to be in groups where people fight with us and help us and direct
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.440]   us to things that will give strength to our faith rather than weaken them.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:33.120]   Number five, "Remember that the body has many members, and some are scholars who have thought
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:41.440]   long and hard about things that puzzle you and have solved many of them." So 1 Corinthians
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:49.400]   12, 21, "The head cannot say to the feet, 'I have no need of you,' and vice versa."
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.520]   And it may be that sometimes those of us who are doing footwork at any given time might
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.840]   need to remember, "Here, there's some heads, and don't let this conflict with Jesus as
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.460]   they head." That's what he says here in 1 Corinthians 12, 21, "Some are heads and some
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.560]   are feet, and the feet should never say, 'I don't need you, head,' when the head has spent
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.580]   10 years solving the problem you're just stumbling over." No, no, no. The point of the body of
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.460]   Christ is there's an answer to our problems. God is a God of coherence. He's not a God
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.960]   of contradiction. There are answers to the issues in the Bible and the issues of culture,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:34.200]   and people have gone before us, and there's a wealth of wisdom in books, and we should
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.800]   befriend those people. And finally, number six, "Don't, don't stop
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:45.480]   reading your Bible because of these doubts and because of a spirit of cynicism." This
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   is one of Satan's main aims in your doubt and your cynicism is to get you to stop reading
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.400]   when in fact the Bible says, "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ."
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.640]   And one last text, "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked or
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.800]   stands in the way of sinners or sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:15.200]   law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.000]   streams of water that yields its fruit in its season. Its leaf does not wither, and
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.360]   in all that it does, he prospers." So the seasons come, the dry desert winds blow, and
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:35.640]   those whose roots are not planted by the streams wither by cynicism and doubt. But the person
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   whose roots have gone down meditating day and night on the word of God are like a tree
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:50.080]   that have roots way down by the water so that they're not killed by the droughts of doubt.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.400]   Amen. Help my unbelief die. Yeah, that's a great word. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:05.280]   for joining us today. If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.680]   Next time we ask why God chose the foolish things of this world and not the wise and
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.720]   powerful. Why not use the wealthiest innovators, the smartest geniuses, the most articulate
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   orators, the world's greatest athletes, the most recognizable movie stars, all to spread
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.360]   his gospel around the world? Why does God prefer to choose and use the weakest in his
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.960]   mission? I'm your host Tony Renke. We'll answer that on Monday. We'll see you then.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   [END]
