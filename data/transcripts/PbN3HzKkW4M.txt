[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220]   The following is a conversation with Kelsey Sharon, Canadian Forces veteran, artillery
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.980]   gunner who served in Afghanistan at 18 years old and came home with severe PTSD.
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.840]   She went on to found Brass and Unity, which creates unique jewelry, large part of the
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.200]   proceeds from which go to help rehabilitate the lives, limbs and mental health of veterans
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080]   and first responders.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.200]   She has a big personality, big heart and an intense passion for life.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.420]   So when our paths happened to cross, I knew we needed to talk.
[00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.120]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.880]   To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.560]   And now here's my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.600]   You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you and that your grandfather
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.160]   was a World War II vet.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.000]   The people that have gone through World War II in my family too, they don't seem to talk
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   about it much.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.360]   Like the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.560]   I mean, it's understandable.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.640]   I can respect that.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.160]   But I don't think people fully understood the value in human stories over time and sharing
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.440]   that that certain civilizations don't have written language.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   The value in that being passed down is extraordinary.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.240]   So we didn't really have that with the World War II vets, it seems like.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.240]   Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.480]   My grandmother went through Holodomor, which is the Ukrainian starvation of millions of
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.800]   people and then obviously went through World War II with the Nazi occupation.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   And same on the grandfather's side who, on my dad's side, the grandfather fought in World
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   War II.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.280]   They seem to not want to talk about those experiences to protect you from the suffering,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.560]   to protect you from the evil that they've experienced, which is sad because the lessons
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.840]   from that history are not then propagated through you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.320]   And also there's something about the strength you carry with you knowing that that's in
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   your blood.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.920]   Those great heroes are in your blood and that suffering, overcoming that suffering is in
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   your blood.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.120]   - I would argue that's exactly correct.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.680]   If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage that has done something super
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.120]   gnarly that's just been a badass in so many different ways, you want to know about that
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.120]   person.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.160]   You have that person's blood in you.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480]   That's important to acknowledge.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.320]   And when that isn't shared, I feel like it's just a detriment to that individual.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.960]   - What do you make of World War II in terms of history?
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.120]   Do you think about those kinds of wars where two times more civilians died than the number
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.680]   of military personnel?
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.080]   So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians and the invasion of homes, the
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   burning of homes, the bombing of homes, all of that.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:06.460]   - World War II for me, I find that was the first experience where I became just obsessed
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.080]   with history.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.640]   World War II really did it for me.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.920]   I'm not sure if it's because of the dramatization of film and TV and the way that our generation
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.800]   has looked at it, but for me it was more than that.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.180]   I felt a deep connection to it and I still can't figure out why.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.440]   Like a pull almost.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.480]   People joke around about those past lives and those things or those connections and
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.360]   there's something deeper within me that feels a pull towards that.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.520]   And I'm not quite sure if it's because I had family that escaped Hungary once the Soviets
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.080]   came in, so thanks for that, or if it was because my grandfather served in it or for
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   whatever reason.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.640]   I just, I have this pull to it.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.840]   And so when you think about the mass casualty of the civilian population, that's very difficult
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.280]   for me to wrap my brain around after being in a war and seeing when you have a small
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.040]   subset of civilians die, how much of an impact that has on that community right there in
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.640]   just a tiny area.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.800]   So to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe and all across and all that, I really
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.680]   struggle with that because I don't know that I can comprehend what that would truly mean
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.960]   to somebody if I didn't experience it or see it for what it is.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.480]   But so first of all, you're right, a lot of people are drawn to World War II for different
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   reasons.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:43.280]   So one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand how it's possible to have that scale of evil
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.160]   in very different flavors of evil.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.200]   It's almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.240]   And then also it's fascinating that so many people can follow leaders like that with the
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.960]   pride and with the love of country.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.200]   And that's like, it's almost like this weird experiment.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.960]   It's like, wow, I wonder if I'm the same, I'm made from the same cloth as those people.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.840]   Like would I be a good German if I lived in Germany and was, you know, during the time
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.240]   of Hitler, would I believe that Germany has been done wrong?
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.640]   I'm Jewish, by the way, which makes me a little bit more comfortable talking about this.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:33.040]   Is, would I believe in the dream sold by charismatic dictator who says that wrongs have been done
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.400]   and we need to correct those wrongs?
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.760]   That to me, this is the compelling thing that draws me to World War II, the human nature
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   question.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   I would agree with you on that.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.400]   I think there's a way to look at people like that.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.960]   And at that time, there was no real, well, there wasn't a full understanding of the psyche
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   the way that we're starting to.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.960]   I mean, we still don't understand any of it, but it seems like the, you know, the time
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.800]   gap back then, there was no real understanding of sociopaths and narcissists and, you know,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.320]   psychopaths and really what those traits were.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.280]   And I feel like you, you know, people will follow blindly if they're given a good enough
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   reason.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.480]   Well, if you have an individual who is ranting and screaming at the top of his lungs in the
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.640]   middle of these town squares and he's getting this attention, it's human nature to want
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.560]   to understand and be a part of a group mentality.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.280]   It's human nature to want to fit in.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.120]   And so I don't know if it's more of people were at the beginning were just, this is the
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.800]   cool thing to do, or if it was they were genuinely terrified, or if there was an aspect that
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.700]   was like, this guy is saying something that resonates with me.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.120]   There could be a lot of different things.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.080]   I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to, or no one got to really, you know, examine
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.680]   this individual's brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.520]   Because that's always been the biggest thing for me is I'm really curious about why people
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.920]   do what they do.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.040]   Like deeply, deeply curious about it.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.080]   I'm not sure who's more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   So, I mean, the question that's coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.880]   ways even if there wasn't a Hitler?
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.280]   You know, it's the people that created Hitler or did Hitler create the events of World War
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.360]   II?
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.680]   I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.600]   That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.800]   The failed artists in the case of Hitler, they're all out there.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.200]   And it's just when there's this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.880]   take over.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.600]   And it doesn't matter if they're evil or good.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.920]   What, how evil, how truly insane they are.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.200]   Like I think Stalin was much more cold and calculating.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.040]   He wasn't as insane as Hitler.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.200]   Hitler was legitimately insane.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.480]   Like especially later on in the war where he would do irrational actions, I would say.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.680]   But that's like a weird roll of the dice.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.320]   You could have gotten a totally different leader.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.960]   Wanting to take over the entirety of Europe and then invading Russia.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   That's like insanity.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.800]   Yeah, that just even, just the first part of that, wanting to take over Europe.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.000]   If you really think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, he want, this one
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.520]   individual was like, I want all of this.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.920]   If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him and his traits that we know
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:47.880]   of into any sort of document nowadays that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   this guy would set it on fire.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.560]   He himself was so, I think so damaged.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.240]   And he reminds me a lot of people now who struggle to find their way.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.480]   or by whatever the sector they're in.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.320]   He reminds me very much of that like, what's the word I'm looking for?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.520]   Just that individual who is just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   And just it's that mentality.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.660]   He really came from that it seems like.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.400]   And when you foster that too long, you get that.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.280]   There's a book called, what is it?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.840]   Man from Underground by Dostoevsky.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.880]   I might be misnaming the book, but it's about the bitterness of a man.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.840]   It's like it breeds within his mind and it just grows that bitterness.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:48.720]   I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you're younger, when you
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:56.120]   have a choice, when you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold it's the Jocko thing?
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.200]   Do you hold it, do you carry the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   of that?
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.760]   That's the decision.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see that's because he took responsibility
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   and leadership.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   - I know you can't say he wasn't a leader.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.400]   - Yeah, so it's not that he's a failure.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.080]   He's not a person, not a failure, but you can't say he's powerless, did not take action.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:29.640]   I think he's just basically embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   But the insanity of obviously many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting them
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.440]   in camps and torturing them.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   But many of those people, Jewish people were also some of the best scientists.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:49.440]   The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans, it makes no sense.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.760]   But so that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.800]   are these the same humans?
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.000]   And also, are there echoes of that now?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.080]   And is that going to happen again?
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.860]   Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.880]   Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we're not
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   yet?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:21.000]   But because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history will allow
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   it to happen again.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.960]   And then obviously it's a very common thing to whatever political leader you don't like
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   to call them Hitler.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   Of course.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.320]   Which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler, the weight
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.320]   behind that has been completely lost in this generation.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.640]   This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   Or Stalin.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.800]   To be honest, the starvation, I've just been talking to a lot of folks recently, especially
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.120]   like North Korea, with the Yonmi Park, starvation.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:05.240]   And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn't, I mean, time and time again, not having food
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.880]   to eat is the thing that people say is the worst.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.120]   Everything.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.320]   It's way worse than murder, not having food, and the places that takes your mind and the
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.000]   actions that forces you to do.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   That's terrifying.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.440]   And all of that seems very distant in our history.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   I love her.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.040]   I watched that interview with her.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad because when she was on Joe and she sat there
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.320]   and said, Joe's like, "Do you, have you done any therapy?"
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   And she laughed.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.440]   I was like, "Oh, that's my girl."
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.840]   It's such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.200]   her mind because we kind of explored her story.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.440]   And that's, there's power and importance to her story, but it's so difficult to understand.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:58.120]   Like how does she become healthier and better even more so than she's already?
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.760]   She's recovered quite a bit.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.600]   You know, she's found herself quite a bit, but I wonder, is she haunted?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.040]   You're saying questions I want to ask.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:13.320]   I mean, that's what I mean, because after being in a war, there are certain things,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.480]   there's certain atrocities that you see that it doesn't matter the therapy that you do.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.440]   And I don't care what all the special ops guys say.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.840]   Like I know plenty of them that have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.680]   But I also know them when they've been out for 10 years.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.040]   There's things that haunt people differently, but there's no way there's not something going
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   on there deeply.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:43.080]   And there's also extra levels of complexity in her case, because I mean, this is what
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:52.800]   just looking at history about family is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   Right?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   We like the water or something.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.760]   We like water or we like this because there is no like individual, like when they said
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.960]   there was no love or anything.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.760]   But there is a love for the...
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   Just that individual.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   Just that individual.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.720]   And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.080]   But it's still love.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.320]   You don't know the alternative.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   So it's not even...
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.840]   It's complicated because like, I wonder if she truly explored it, what you would find.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.720]   Because the trauma, much of her trauma, I think comes from when she was escaping North
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.840]   Korea.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.040]   Treatment by China.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   It's like the...
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   And her mom.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.880]   And when she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.800]   So it's like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her, and doing so nonchalantly,
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.120]   like it's part of just the way of life.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.160]   That I wonder if she sees kind of...
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.480]   Yeah, it's so complicated because childhood...
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.560]   It would be normal to her because she didn't know any different.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.560]   Exactly.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.480]   I grew up poor, but I never sensed that.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.960]   Because your parents didn't make you.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.600]   Well, everyone else around was too.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.880]   And so you don't notice it.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.720]   I mean, it's a cultural thing.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.520]   So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others,
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.320]   when you learn of the alternative.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.800]   That's a dark reality when you're abused.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:29.480]   I wonder, I mean, you truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand that
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.520]   you were being abused.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.720]   That's a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse,
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.600]   if you don't know better, that that's safer.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.760]   That's like, what's a better life?
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.240]   Suffering and then learning that you were suffering or just suffering until your last
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   days.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.680]   There's two ways to look at this.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.600]   I'd argue on one side that suffering and suffering until you die, you know no difference.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   So you can't have hope.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.520]   You can't have this idea that there's better.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.280]   And sometimes that's, keep that in its box.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.900]   But then if you have kind of what you have with Park, where she knows now that there's
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.200]   different, she knows that there's better, then you run into those, what is the damage
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.320]   that has been done?
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.520]   What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.960]   I know she's a mom.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.080]   So it's like now you got to look long term a little bit because now she's an influence
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.160]   on a child.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.600]   And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.520]   And I know that sounds horrible for the living in trauma your whole life and just not knowing
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.920]   any better.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:45.560]   But there's, I don't know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.160]   if it actually would be better.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.880]   Because there's no way to really find that out.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880]   I don't think.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   Yeah, I think.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.160]   But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they're suffering,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.700]   you're putting a burden on them.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.880]   That's the first step on a long journey.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.360]   And so, and obviously now that she knows that there's suffering, she wants to make people
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.720]   in North Korea currently suffer less.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.680]   And that's an admirable goal.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.360]   It's what we do to each other.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try to make it better.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.080]   And unmask is probably in a long arc of history going to make for a better world.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.460]   I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:35.160]   I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave individuals suffering when you know
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.280]   that they're actively suffering while you're just living your day to day life in the Western
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.080]   world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   your mind, like that interview fucked me up a little bit, I won't lie.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.360]   Like, and I had some of the girls in my office listen to it.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.160]   They're just bawling because there's, we're all parents and there's this idea that not
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.080]   being able to feed our children, that just the idea of that damages the psyche.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.240]   It brings up the pain in the chest, like just the idea of it.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.120]   And so going to the grocery store for about a week after that, I just remember standing
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.060]   there looking and just going, "What the fuck are we doing?"
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:17.120]   But then there's that snap reality that comes into play and goes, "So how do we fix that?"
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.800]   You gotta take on China.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.960]   That's never gonna happen.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.520]   And the reason that's not gonna happen, it's happening again.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.280]   So a Connie comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.560]   Iran makes the deal with China for her, the roadway to get the oil.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   Well, that's done in the blink of an eye without anyone knowing.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.980]   There's no way.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.920]   There's just so much at play with China.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   They control such a large aspect of our world.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.840]   Unfortunately, that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have to happen.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.640]   And then your people would come in.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.240]   It would be a mess.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   What do you mean your people?
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.040]   What do you mean your people?
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Your Russians.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.600]   Did you hear what she said about Russians?
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   Did you hear what she said?
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   Russians?
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   I love Russians.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   You know what I didn't love?
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.400]   The Russian recruiting video that came out.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.740]   That shit was terrifying.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   Did you watch it?
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   I told you about it.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740]   I didn't watch it.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   I didn't watch it.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   Oh, shocker.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.080]   The USA put out a recruiting video.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.080]   And then like a day or two later, Russia put one out.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.240]   And the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.040]   moms and she was going to go change the world.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   Right?
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.080]   Russia came out with one.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.620]   It's the character from like Rocky, essentially.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.120]   And there are guys in the mud and just in the rain just fucking doing pushups, just pushing
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   it out.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.280]   They're just like, they see their boot.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.680]   They're just like crushing things.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.880]   And I'm like, and it's all like, and the deep Russian voice.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.820]   I'm like, oh my God.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.820]   Which one is better?
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.820]   Would you say?
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   Which bothered you more?
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   What do you mean by bother?
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.960]   Specify.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.580]   So deception is a funny thing.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.340]   Because when you're young and you're choosing to go to the military or not, it's not like
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.940]   you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory for a life is.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.500]   For many people, going to the military is a really, makes them incredible human beings.
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.340]   Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.340]   So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.780]   I think it's a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don't
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.540]   like marketing people.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.580]   And so this is essentially a marketing effort.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.860]   Yeah, it is a marketing effort.
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.140]   So which one do you like as a marketing effort?
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   Better Russia.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   Yeah, I do.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140]   There you go.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140]   I do.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.500]   Because Canada doesn't, you know what our recruiting videos are?
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.140]   It's like, I love it.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.140]   They're the best.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.140]   Sorry.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.140]   Oh, fuck.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.140]   Here we go.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.140]   It's starting.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   It started.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140]   Awesome.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.700]   So Canada does these ones where it's like, it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.300]   movements and then they'll like snip it together really quick.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.220]   And it'll be like a Navy one and then a guy jumping out of a plane and then it'll be like
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.660]   an artillery and then like an armored and it'll be like, join the Canadian forces today.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.340]   And like, that's like their, their videos.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:16.060]   So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.020]   who don't really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.220]   can to make sure that vets don't get any support when they come home.
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.680]   So they, I can see why that one is acceptable.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.040]   What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic in my opinion.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.100]   I like that style better though.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.640]   I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.540]   I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.220]   a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.240]   and a harder body.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.140]   Because I know when you go to the US, I've also encountered plenty of soldiers that are
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   600 pounds.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.360]   What are you going to do?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.220]   So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.980]   or not maybe incredible.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.980]   I was an incredible shape.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.820]   It was the best shape of my life.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.820]   So I'm okay with that.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   It's okay.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820]   I, you know what?
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.820]   I used to do sit ups.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.100]   Like no, I would do sit ups in the morning when I was little until I could see my six,
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.560]   like I always had a six pack because all I did was train.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:26.240]   But like if I couldn't like see it, I would sit there in morning cartoons and just do
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   sit ups.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.220]   And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.800]   So if you had like Instagram back then, you'd be a David Goggins.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.960]   You would be just like screaming.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   Without the cursing.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.160]   That cursing started once the military started.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   Okay.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   Got it.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.200]   So I mean, people should know, they probably already know that you also competed in Taekwondo.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   Like you were an athlete of all kinds.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   I even saw rugby in there.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.320]   I was good at rugby.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.960]   I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.880]   I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.720]   We were doing an exhibition game.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.240]   I don't do exhibition games well.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.160]   I don't do like for fun well.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   I don't do like-
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   So you're very competitive.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   No, not me.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   So you're being funny.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   Ah, there it is.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   He gets it.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.520]   You see, he's not a robot.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:23.960]   What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960]   was winning.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.400]   The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.680]   And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.840]   to the other and she just kept hitting tries left, right, and center.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   She was fast.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.200]   So I figured if I just aimed her up like she's a target and I just run full force at her
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.440]   because she was a tall individual.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.520]   If I do that, I'll take her out of the knees.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.800]   So I did that.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.960]   But what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.480]   out and she just stayed there.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.000]   But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.840]   My mom was there because mom was my mom's my biggest fan.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.760]   She was supportive of this.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.760]   She's supportive of everything.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   She didn't miss a game.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.920]   She didn't miss in anything.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   And I stood up and I kind of turned around and we already had a girl break her nose that
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   day.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.040]   So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.800]   My mom was like, "I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over."
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.400]   And so I turned around and looked at her and she just she almost vomited on the spot.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.680]   And I was like, "What's wrong?"
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.080]   She's like, "Don't move your eyelids off."
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.080]   I'm like, "But I can see."
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   Like I was trying to blink, but like it was just down so I could just constantly see.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.840]   She's like, "We're just going to go to the emergency.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.640]   We're just going to go there now."
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   Was there blood?
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   Yeah, there's lots of it.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.200]   But I couldn't really tell.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   Okay.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   Were you okay with blood at that point?
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Yeah, I've always been okay with blood.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   I mean I guess you did Tae Kwon Do and all that.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   I didn't get knocked out very often.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.080]   I didn't really, when I was younger in Tae Kwon Do, I was really good.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.440]   I only lost a handful of times.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.120]   So when I did lose, that was bad.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.520]   But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my face.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.280]   Like nothing like that really.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.960]   So nothing freaked me out too much.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.400]   Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.240]   A mix of both.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.640]   This was right after, not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory rape.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:28.280]   And that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like she knew love
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.080]   because of that person.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.480]   That person was like a god to me.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.280]   And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.680]   So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:45.160]   Oh, like it was betrayal that there's just somebody that was a symbol of love for you,
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.680]   could also be a very bad person?
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:52.040]   I used to eat, sleep, and breathe whatever that man said from four years old on.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.600]   I lived with my coaches at a point.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.480]   So I could train that much.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.180]   I helped look after their daughter.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.720]   I was at the club 24/7.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.880]   Just the idea that somebody could do something like that, yeah, that really messed me up.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.200]   Where were you on 9/11?
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.720]   I was 11 and I was in my parents' basement.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   In where?
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   Ontario.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.680]   In Ontario, Canada.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.560]   What did you think of 9/11 at that age from Canada?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:33.840]   Did it have an impact on you in terms of changing the level of evil you thought is there in
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.720]   the world today?
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   Not initially.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.440]   I remember it really vividly.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.440]   I have a decent memory for certain things, it seems like.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.880]   Stuff like that I stick with really well.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   I remember watching it.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.480]   I was sitting on the couch and my mom called my dad because my parents are truck drivers.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.200]   My dad was on the road, if I'm not mistaken, and he would go in and out of cities all the
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   time.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   I think he was on the East Coast.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   My mom was a little panicky.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.760]   She tried to get a hold of him on, I think at the time it was beepers.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.720]   Yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a pay phone and call us.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.160]   He was fine.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:16.440]   I remember my mom being really upset and I couldn't quite grasp why she was so upset.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.680]   I knew something really bad had happened.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:25.320]   It's when I then saw the second plane go into the tower and I remember her just, the stereotypical
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.680]   hand over her mouth and she just felt sick and she just was so confused.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   I knew it was bad, but I didn't fully grasp it.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.760]   We went to school that day and they had talked about it briefly.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.400]   You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:47.560]   There was a point that week that all of a sudden all of the children who were from a
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.720]   Middle Eastern family were not at school.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.440]   I just remember them saying like a lot of people aren't coming to school, but it was
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.600]   in particular.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.320]   I think parents were afraid once it got out that it was of a certain group.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   They were afraid for their own kids and fair enough.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.400]   I mean, you never know.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.120]   You don't know.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.240]   I knew it impacted me enough that I did write.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.280]   I remember the school was doing a memorial for it and I remember they asked, I wrote
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.640]   a poem and a reporter was there and I read it on air.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:28.400]   I remember it was a very short one, but I remember I wanted to do something, but I didn't
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.720]   know why or for what reason.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   I knew I wanted to do something to honor it, but I couldn't grasp why.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.280]   You eventually went to Afghanistan.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:43.840]   Did that begin to plant the seed of thinking about conflict in the world?
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.200]   It's a good question.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.120]   I've never thought about it that in depth.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.680]   I mean, I've done 12 years of therapy.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.960]   You'd think that would have come up, Dr. Pasi, but apparently not.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.080]   We'll work on it though.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.880]   When did the idea of war start entering your mind?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.440]   Late high school, I think it was for me.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.360]   I finished high school at 17.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.160]   I moved away and went to college.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.880]   I went to Algonquin College because I wasn't smart enough to get into Ottawa U. I was like,
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.800]   well, Algonquin she is.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.840]   I just wanted to play sports and frankly, I wanted away from my small town that I was
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   living in.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.560]   I went through a bad high school breakup as a kid and that where you think that's the
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   love of your life and you just can't bear to be anywhere near anybody.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   I moved away as fast as I possibly could.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:36.640]   I didn't grasp it still at that point.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.480]   Love and heartbreak.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.640]   Why did you become a soldier?
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.280]   Why did you want to become a soldier?
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.720]   My parents told me from an early age, they always figured I would either be a cop.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.200]   They didn't think military, but they thought it would be like a type A personality, possibly
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.840]   carry a gun situation.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.400]   I'd never hunted before.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   We never had guns in our house.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.920]   I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.000]   If anything, it was the opposite.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   All the hunters on the property, all the deer would come to our property and all the hunters
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   would be...
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   No, I'm not.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.880]   My mom would put salt licks out so that they wouldn't get killed.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.640]   Your property was the safe space for the deer.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.200]   Yeah, it was 17 acres of forest and we had two turkeys that used to walk up and down
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.480]   the driveway every day.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.920]   We had bears in there.
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.520]   Nobody bothered them.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.120]   There was no aspect of like, "I want to go kill shit."
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   That was not like a thing.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.840]   I had no idea I wanted to take anybody off the face of the earth or anything.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:43.440]   I went to school and because I'm a history person, my parents has always made it really
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.400]   important that Remembrance Day is the thing in our life.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.520]   So that's Veterans Day for you.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.880]   So it's November 11th.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.760]   And it's you go, you honor.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.000]   I don't care if you don't want to go.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.680]   I don't care if it's raining.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.960]   You go.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.320]   And so I went to the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa that year, which was...
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   It's our capital, which is...
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.840]   Yeah, it's our capital and it's really small.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:12.280]   And so I went, but I took the bus and I was on the bus back to Algonquin and I met a lady
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.640]   who was like a World War II vet, really old lady.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.160]   She had an Air Force uniform on and just like this row of medals.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.560]   And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited to extreme interactions we've had over the
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.200]   short period of time, I'm curious and I'll just ask you.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.520]   And so I just got up and talked to her and just started talking to her.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   And she didn't say like, I don't remember exactly her words, but she'd served.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:43.400]   She was one of the first females to fly and all of these kinds of things that stuck in
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   my head.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.360]   And we just kind of kept talking and I missed my stop.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.960]   And then I finished talking to her and I got back on the bus and went back to the college
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:57.760]   and walked into my small apartment where I had two roommates.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.360]   These two guys I went to high school with, one of them I went to high school with, one
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   was from out of town.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.840]   And I just didn't like what I was...
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   I wasn't happy.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.320]   I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.400]   And I didn't know what I wanted to do truthfully.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.640]   Something just said, "Why don't you join the Army?"
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.680]   Like in myself, my self-talk was like, "Let's just join the military.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   Let's do it."
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.400]   Are you in general somebody that just follows the gut?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.280]   Like when your heart tells you something, you go with it?
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:31.360]   For the most part, because I figured out, at least now I figured out what parts I could,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.280]   what feeling I can trust and which one I can't.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.160]   Which one's anxiety versus which one's my actual intuition talking.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.720]   So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   Because they wouldn't let me be infantry.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:48.640]   I mean, why would you want to be infantry?
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.480]   I mean, you're naming a lot of dangerous activities.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.480]   Yeah, but that wasn't a thought in my mind at the time.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.760]   My idea was if I was going to do this and I was going to put myself through the bullshit
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.280]   and the training and all of the hell and the pushups and the getting blah, blah, blah,
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.400]   screamed at, I wanted to do something that I know was actually going to be affecting
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400]   something.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.480]   And what I knew was making change or affecting or on the front lines was infantry, artillery,
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.480]   or armored.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.760]   So I was like, "One of those."
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.000]   Can you explain the difference, infantry, artillery, and armored?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.800]   Do you want like the layman's term or do you want me to actually explain, explain?
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.080]   Well, listen to your conversation with Jocko, especially.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.720]   I love how you get into details.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.560]   Okay, so let's detail this then.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   Okay.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:34.120]   So infantry is your front line door kicking, you know, blasting the door open, running,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.680]   and get the fuck on the ground, just that, that, that, that, that.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.880]   They're the guys that, you know, double tap you in the face and they show up in the middle
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.800]   of the night and put a barrel in your head.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.480]   Like those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches, that are eating MREs, who
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.400]   are being shot at, who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work and not sleeping
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.360]   and carrying the hundred pound pack and are side by side with your buddies in the trenches.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.440]   I wanted that, that.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.920]   They said I was too small for that.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.720]   You were, sorry to interrupt, you were too small, under a hundred pounds?
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.880]   At the time I was about 103 and I'm five foot, like on a, if you roll my back out, like I
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.640]   really try, I'm five foot.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.880]   At the time though, I think my license said 4'11".
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.160]   So you were too small for infantry.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.480]   Yeah, they just, there was no mandate at which they said you can't be, but they said, you
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.160]   know, we don't want to put you through training that you're going to fail out of and then
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.640]   have to recourse you and then find a new job for you.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.760]   And they want to try to, if this is what you're going in for, they want to have you follow
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.600]   through that path.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.880]   So then there was armored, which are your tanks.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:48.200]   So that's your movie like fury where your tank battles in, which we don't really do
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.160]   anymore, but you're rolling around in tanks.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.840]   You got guys in the back or you're a driver, you're a turret gunner, which I would have
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   enjoyed.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:00.440]   But the idea of being in a closed metal box, something about it made me panic.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.040]   So I was like, maybe not for me.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.520]   There's of course power to that kind of a big gun.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.760]   Well, that's why I went for the bigger one.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.760]   Okay.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.720]   By the way, I think Russia leads the world in number of tanks.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.800]   They're still, it's very like, what is it?
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.920]   Alpha demonstration of like force.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.680]   Like, look, we have largest number of tanks.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.120]   You know what takes tanks out though?
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   What?
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.320]   Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.240]   Yeah, but tanks still look bad-ass.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.400]   They look great, but they don't last.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.320]   But so much of the military, like we said, with the recruiting videos, it's a display
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:37.000]   of power versus the actual implementation of power.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Fair.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Okay.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Artillery.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   So I'm doing my best here.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.360]   I don't even know what double tap means, which you said earlier.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.920]   So it's double tap is like two shots to the face.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.160]   Why two?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   To be sure.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   Okay.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   All right.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   You guys, taxpayers pay for the ammo.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   It's fine.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   But you don't want to do three because it's wasting the ammo.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.520]   Well, now that's a waste.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.520]   Okay.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   Double tap to the face.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:02.160]   There's so much awesome terminology here or gruesome terminology depending on your perspective.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   Okay.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   So artillery.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   So that's the hand of God.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   Sorry.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   No, I...
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   That's intensely romanticized version, but okay.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   It is.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   Artillery, the hand of God.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.160]   Because it will reach out.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   It's like F-18 pilots or bombers.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.160]   You won't know they're there until they're there.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   And so for artillery, I really honestly didn't think artillery would be a fit for me.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   I didn't know much about it.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.160]   They were just like, "These are what you can pick from."
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.160]   And I was like, "I'll go here."
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   So in World War II, they used to have a gun.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   They used to have a gun.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   And they would shoot at the enemy.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   And I was like, "I'll go here."
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   So it's the, we're called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the Queen made us
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   royal.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   So Canadian artillery.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   And we shoot these rounds.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   When you're in training, you shoot smaller ammunition.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   They're about 40 pounds.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   They go, I'm going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers, whatever that is.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   They go, I'm going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers, whatever that is.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   You're right.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   You're right."
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   You're right."
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   You're right."
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:37:10.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:34.160]   You're right."
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:38:02.360]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:30.560]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:58.760]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:28.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."

[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."

[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."

[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."

[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:43.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:43:11.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:53.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.160]   And they're like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:45:08.040]   And it's not just like a heat from outside, it's like this radiation within you that is
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   something I've never felt since.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   - You, just to take a small step back to the weapons training, what kind of guns did you
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   train on?
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.040]   Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   - I love Carl Gustafs.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.040]   - What are those Carl G's?
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.040]   - Carl G's?
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.040]   - What's that?
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.040]   - What's a Carl G's?
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.040]   - My only experience with the rocket launchers is from the movie "Combat."
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   - Oh, okay.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.040]   - And I've seen "Commando" with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   - Oh, yeah, and we've all discussed.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.520]   I haven't seen that yet, and I've heard about it, and people have made me tell.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.360]   - I feel like you haven't seen a single movie that's relevant to war and military, because
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.120]   every time anyone brings it up, you say you haven't seen it.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   - I don't have time to watch movies, Lex.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.800]   - "Platoon," you haven't seen "Platoon," which is...
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   - You're the scientist.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   How do you have the time?
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   - I'm not a scientist.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   I just play one on TV.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   - Okay.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   - Sure.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   - So, what...
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   Can you talk about the rocket launcher?
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.800]   - Carl G's.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   - And maybe any other movies?
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   - Any other...
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.160]   - For both engineering, actually, to me, those guns are very interesting from an engineering
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   perspective, too.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:56.160]   - Well, they should be.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.280]   They're fascinating when you take them apart, and you see how small the parts get down to,
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.800]   and how necessary every single little piece is to make that thing run.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.960]   And even without the tiniest little BB smaller than a piece on there, an artillery gun might
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:09.960]   not run.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:17.120]   So, we were trained on Carl G's, I think called M72s, which are disposable rocket launchers.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.360]   I'll back up.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.680]   So, Carl G's are around, I don't know the exact millimeter of the round.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.800]   It's been a while since I shot them.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.680]   We only did those in training.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.560]   But essentially, it takes...
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.760]   Most people, one person can fire it, effectively hold it and fire it.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.400]   It takes another person to load it.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.440]   So, you put it onto your shoulder, and it weighs, I would...
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.640]   I don't know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds?
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.640]   - Oh, wow.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.640]   - Can't remember.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.640]   It's been a minute.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   It's been a minute.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   - But one person can carry it?
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   - Okay.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.440]   - It seems like a rocket launcher is a pretty intense kind of device.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.640]   - It for sure is.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   I mean, it's the diameter, I can't even tell you the diameter.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   They're about that big.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   I mean...
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   - And it goes on your shoulder.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.800]   - It goes on your shoulder, and then it has a little sight that pops out that's almost
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   like plastic-like, which is kind of funny, because it reminds me of like the little Green
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:10.800]   Army men.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.080]   It just felt so flimsy to me.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.240]   I was like, "This is hilarious."
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.520]   And then another person stands behind you and opens the hatch.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:23.040]   And so there's this, there's these two levers, and you just kind of open it.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.320]   And then the back end, which is flared, so it's just a tube, and then it's flared.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.240]   That will open it and drop down, and you load a round into that, and then you load it back
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   up.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   - Got it.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.800]   - And you're never supposed to stand behind it, because the blast behind it will kill
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.040]   you.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.040]   It's...
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:46.040]   But in my case, when I fired it, it was me and another individual.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.640]   It wasn't Sarah Pellegrin, but it was another girl that was smaller.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:54.040]   And the person is supposed to wrap around your waist and tuck low and hold your stability.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.560]   And we were just aiming at tanks that day, and they were just concrete heads, so they
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.480]   would just either, they would hit and bounce off or whatever.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.640]   And so when my sergeant saw that, he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.920]   "No, I'm just gonna..."
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.240]   And he got real low and just like wrapped both of us.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:18.100]   And then we'd fire it, and it feels like you're getting punched in the side of the head on
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.160]   repeat by Jocko.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.080]   You lose all your hearing.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.760]   Snot comes out of your nose, and you're just kind of discombobulated for a minute.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.960]   It's a real mindfuck.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:39.760]   Is there any other kind of guns that, at that time, because you were new to this, you haven't
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.520]   shot guns when you were younger, that were really impressive to you in the training process?
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.760]   All of them, because I've never fired a weapon.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.600]   So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe, the long barrel.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.320]   The cute thing about those is when I have that slung, my barrel drags on the ground.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.280]   So that's fun.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.680]   And they shoot your 7.62 or your 5.56 round.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680]   I loved that.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.200]   I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel, which is what the SF guys use, not because
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:14.080]   it's cooler looking, which it obviously is, but because it was functional for my body
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.880]   height and it didn't drag on the ground when I ran.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.880]   I loved those.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.980]   They're your personal weapon.
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.820]   Being an artillery gunner, if you're not an officer, at least in our unit, you didn't
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:23.820]   get a side piece.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.720]   I didn't have a side piece, Lex.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.840]   So I never had a handgun of any type.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.040]   I fired those in training.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.360]   You can't get over that side piece comment.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   Look at you.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.920]   I was going to say, I know what a side piece is.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   You don't have to explain to me.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   But you're single.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.760]   So how do you even have a side piece if you don't have a main piece?
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.280]   The joke would be the fact that we have a total misunderstanding what side piece is.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   Okay, great.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.280]   So you didn't have a side piece as a non-officer.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.280]   Right.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.240]   So I never fired those much.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.800]   We did grenades in training.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   Oh, cool.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   Yeah, grenades are fun.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   I love grenades.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:56.880]   I have a massive one tattooed on me.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.760]   I have them all over my office.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.520]   How does a grenade work?
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.360]   There's the spoon and the pin.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.900]   So the pin holds the spoon in place.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:11.280]   When you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside, as long as the spoon is up against
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.280]   it, it won't fire.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.160]   As soon as that spoon goes, I believe it causes a reaction on the inside and you've got about
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.640]   five seconds to check it.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.000]   You'd be better to ask that question too.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.320]   I don't want me to get philosophical on this.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:30.480]   But there's something about a grenade, because you're essentially committing suicide unless
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.520]   you get rid of the thing.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520]   There's something like-
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.800]   Or if you're unlucky and it just goes off when you pull the pin, which has happened
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   to tons of people.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.120]   So it just feels like a very kind of leap.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   It's a dangerous leap into the abyss every time you use the thing.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.600]   Because when you shoot a gun, the gun is much less likely to malfunction in terms of all
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.480]   the possible ways it can go wrong.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.360]   It just seems like grenade is like-
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   Primitive almost.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   Yeah, it's primitive.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.880]   It's also real, like in a way that like a bar fight, like being punched in the face
[00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   is real.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.920]   It's like you're here with a weapon of destruction.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.440]   It's just you and the thing.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.720]   You have to get rid of it.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:09.720]   I don't know.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.360]   Is that terrifying to you?
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.760]   Do people still use grenades in warfare?
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.040]   Yeah, those are fantastic.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.080]   The Taliban were throwing them over the wall at the airport in Kabul.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   People use them all the time.
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.780]   Because when you're in Afghanistan, if you're in a rural area, you're going from village
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.160]   to village and they're mud hut walls.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.240]   They're tall, but you're walking through corridors and stuff.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:31.040]   All you got to do is lob one of those.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.800]   It's going to take the whole unit out that just walked by.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:39.760]   They're accurate if you're close enough and they're effective if you're close enough.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.640]   I love them though.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:47.720]   I think they're fascinating to me because they're such a tiny little thing with such
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.320]   devastation.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.180]   They just can cause such devastation.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.900]   But for me, when I had them, some of the Canadians would make fun of me because when I did go
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.320]   outside the wire with the British, I had two right here.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.600]   And I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons because in my mind, I could picture
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.640]   myself searching someone and grabbing me and pulling that.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   And that would be me.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.200]   That would have been like, "Yep, if anyone that was going to happen to, it was her for
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   sure."
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:21.280]   So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   And like we said, you were in great, no, perfect physical shape.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.280]   Fucking epic shape.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   Epic shape.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.560]   Six pack or I mean...
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Okay.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.480]   So you could do a lot of pull-ups and push-ups.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   Yes.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Okay.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.720]   And well-trained, would you say?
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.440]   Were you already what like...
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   No.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   No.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   No.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.800]   I'll argue that point till I'm blue in the face.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.920]   I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my sergeant.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.280]   He's not a sergeant anymore, but Sergeant Mark LeBlanc.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.720]   He's in Africa right now on a deployment.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.840]   He gave me a call the other day and I remember talking to him about this.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.760]   And it's frustrating because we were at an active war.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:04.240]   We were involved in an active war where the units that I were in were dagged red, which
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.400]   meant they needed people.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:11.140]   So when you need people, things go quick.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.140]   Whether or not that's right.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:15.920]   I mean, you could argue that's the similar thing to what's happening in the world right
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   now.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.080]   We needed a vaccine.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.880]   We got a vaccine.
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.600]   Is it the best it could be?
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   Could it be better?
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.040]   Could it do more things?
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   Sure.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   Probably.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.360]   But with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.060]   That's my logic on that.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:35.480]   For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.840]   I was in basic training in January of 2008.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:43.120]   I was graduated basic SQ, which is all your weapons training.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.520]   Your DP1, which is your trade-specific training.
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.440]   So whatever trade you're going to go into, whether it's infantry, armored, artillery,
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.200]   medic, whatever, that's your DP1.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.480]   It's called different things in different units.
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.360]   And then I got posted to my unit in September.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.320]   So January to September, I had done all my training.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.780]   And I'm an English-speaking individual.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:10.480]   I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French and had to learn all of the weapon
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.720]   systems, everything again that I just learned in that short time frame in French.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:21.480]   This part of your story that you're telling this to Jaco is, one way to say it is very
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.880]   impressive that you had to learn all of this in French.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.840]   So there's also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it, which is difficult probably.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   I didn't have any.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.360]   That's, yeah, I didn't have any.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.440]   But it's also making you a more effective soldier to be socially, for that cohesion
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.280]   to be there, right?
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:42.560]   But also just understanding the basic terminology.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.560]   Correct.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.000]   The right way to say something on the radio, the right way to run a gun, the right way
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.200]   to-- because you got to move with those guns.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.520]   You got seven people.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.520]   It's really magical.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.160]   I'll send you a video.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.360]   When we did some live fire in workup training in Texas before we left, we did a competition
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:05.680]   between the other gun to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:12.960]   It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun because it's like a symphony.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.440]   Everyone has their parts and everyone knows and everyone's yelling, but they know why
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.880]   they're yelling and everyone, this guy's got to do this in order for this guy to load the
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.880]   round.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   It's just, it's beautiful.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.960]   It really is.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.120]   It is gorgeous to watch.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.640]   I miss it deeply.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:33.080]   Is there, by the way, for a gun, is there like one person responsible for the aim or
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.720]   like the specification of the location and somebody else that pulls it, presses the--
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   The lanyard.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   Is that the lanyard?
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.720]   The button.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   Is there a button?
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   It's better than a button.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.240]   I'll show you in a second.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.840]   There's your sergeant in charge and then they have their two IC.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:55.720]   The comms come in to the sergeant and the sergeant is the, or your master bombardier,
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.720]   bombardier chef.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   Sorry, what?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   Bombardier chef?
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   What?
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.720]   Bombardier chef.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   Bombardier chef.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.040]   Oh, that's the French.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.760]   Master bombardier.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:11.600]   It goes like private in the north, like in infantry or in a regular unit, it's like private
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.320]   corporal, master corporal sergeant.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:21.440]   In artillery, it goes gunner, bombardier, master bombardier, sergeant, warrant, and
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.680]   off like that.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.440]   So you have two people, but the serge is like, you don't move till he says move.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.160]   You don't fire till he says fire.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:30.160]   Like he's your guy.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.160]   He'll give you the coordinates.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:35.000]   He'll feed them to the guy that's doing the GPS, that portion.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.160]   I really never did it much.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:38.280]   I wasn't tall enough to see it.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.840]   Like legitimately the way, how high it is up on the gun, like it was, I couldn't see
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   clearly enough.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.500]   It was not good.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.040]   So obviously you have a big personality, you're a strong person.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   You don't say.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:51.840]   And you have a big hat currently.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.640]   I always wear a hat, Lex.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.640]   You always, okay.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.560]   It seems like your height and your size was a factor.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.600]   Oh, for sure.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.720]   How were you able to step up in all those moments?
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.600]   How difficult was it?
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   I don't know that I realized it was difficult while I was doing it because that's just the
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   way it's been.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.000]   I've always been the short person.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   That's life.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.580]   I would, nothing I can do to fix that.
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:13.580]   So there was no point.
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.580]   When am I going to whine about it?
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:18.040]   I'm going to break my femurs and insert things to make me grow a little bit.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.560]   Maybe, maybe since you're in robotics, you can figure that out.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.440]   That's your task now.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.200]   Make me be five foot three.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.640]   That'd be great.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:33.520]   For artillery, really what it came down to was the unit, when I got there, there was
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.960]   only a couple people who spoke any sort of English and my sergeant was not one of them.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:43.920]   But once he kind of started to get to know me a little bit, the best that he could, he
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   started to put effort into making sure I could lift the rounds, make sure my capacity to
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.840]   do my job was there.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.320]   And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:01.120]   So he would take me to the gym with him and he would show me exercises that would specifically
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.800]   help me load the rounds.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.880]   So pick the round up from the ground, pick it up like a trick to put your knee under
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.480]   it, use your legs.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.400]   Instead of just pick it up, use your back, pull your back out.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.860]   He would work on that.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:18.840]   And then depending on the position I was running the gun in, if I was running the side that
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.120]   had the charge bags, I'll explain that in a second.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:28.860]   But if I was running the side that had the charge bags, I could step up onto the gun
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:34.640]   and if I leaned inward enough with my right hand with the charge and I kind of kicked
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:40.360]   off, I could kind of jump and shove it up the tube.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.900]   Got it.
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:42.900]   Almost enough.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:47.360]   If I was running the lanyard, which is the thing that makes it go boom, it's really easy.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.160]   It's a long rope.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.400]   You hook it on and you put it, your right hand on your hip and on your left and you
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.400]   hold it there and you just stare at your sergeant like this and you just wait for him to yell
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.600]   fire.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.940]   And he points at you when he does it.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:03.320]   And when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:08.880]   And when you do that, it alleviates the, a misfire essentially because if you just pull
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.240]   it sometimes that's not enough.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.740]   You got to really give it your whole body into it.
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:18.800]   And so he would train me on how to do things differently so that I could do them effectively.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.800]   And I wasn't a shit pump.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.140]   A what?
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:26.040]   So shit pump is a term that we use in Canada to call somebody useless.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:32.120]   A shit pump is a useless soldier who is just, you're there and that's the shit pump.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.000]   And so we all just deal with it, but somehow they're still there.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   What were we talking about?
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   The lanyard?
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Okay.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   We were talking about artillery guns.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.160]   So those things though, what you would find fascinating is just how they break down when
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.560]   you have to take one of those apart.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.400]   I think your mind would really find it fascinating how a breach comes apart all the way down
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.760]   to like ball bearing size.
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.880]   And the only, and there's a way to just make that gun complete ineffective and all you
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:07.040]   have to do when you're on the charge side, there's a magazine that's a long linear magazine
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.240]   and it holds like 15 little rounds.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.080]   If you just take that thing out, that thing's not firing.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.840]   How many people does it take to move that?
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.440]   Like how easy it is to move that thing?
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.560]   To move a triple seven?
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   Triple seven.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   I like it.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   That's what they're called.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.560]   M777.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.280]   Is a lot of the terminology crossover the same in English and French?
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Okay.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.760]   I mean, M777 does, because it's an obvious howitzer I'm sure has a separate word, but
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.520]   like if you're running it, you're running it in French.
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:40.200]   So like when I'd be running the, when I'm doing the charge bags and I'm doing, I'm doing,
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.920]   you know, I'm loading everything and I'm getting that ready and that's my position that day,
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.800]   I'm also controlling the breach.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.360]   So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.860]   And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.
[01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.760]   So you're yelling like, "Me libe, culasse, au revoir."
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.140]   Like you have to yell all these things, you have to learn them though.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.600]   And so for a long time, it's, it was a little frustrating.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   I won't lie.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.600]   It's really exciting.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.880]   I took a lot of French, but I forgot all of it.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.280]   But I think it's a beautiful, romantic language.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   It's a good language.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   If it's from Paris.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   If it's from Quebec, it's a...
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.280]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.360]   It's a good language to fall in love with.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.120]   Not as good as Russian, but I mean, English is, all right.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.320]   I mean, Russian, is that like a love language?
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   It is to me.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320]   I mean, because you're Russian.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.400]   But like if somebody walked up to me, it was like, "Hey, Kelsey, I like you."
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.140]   I'd be like, "Oh God, he's gonna put me in a camp."
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.360]   That's because you don't understand love, Kelsey.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   I don't.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   We'll talk about that.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   Okay.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   How many people does it take to move the M777?
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   It depends.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.040]   If you're moving it by ground, you're moving it on a truck.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.840]   And when you're moving it on a truck, you're hooking the back of it onto, you're hooking
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.680]   the front of the barrel onto one of those big transport looking trucks that has those
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.000]   cargo tents that's got soldiers in it.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.040]   You don't wanna ever move an M777 by that way if you don't have to.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.680]   The barrel's worth a million dollars.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   Wow.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.120]   Okay, so this is like a serious piece of equipment.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.440]   You don't wanna move them.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   Okay.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.840]   When we got to Kandahar, we were there for a couple of days.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.120]   We got flown out to the FOB we were gonna be at, Forward Observation Base.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.880]   Kandahar is the safe space or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:19.160]   There's things like Tim Horton's there.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.940]   There's Canada House.
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.320]   There's a British side, an American side, a Canadian side.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.960]   And that's where you see all the different countries in the world kind of come together.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.520]   You would see Italians, you would see Germans, you would see French, you would see all these
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.640]   different uniforms and you never know who to salute 'cause you don't know what each
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.080]   thing means.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.400]   It doesn't feel like a war zone.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400]   No.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.400]   Oh God, no.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.400]   There's a boardwalk.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.880]   There's hockey there, floor hockey 'cause Canada had to have that.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:46.920]   There's a Tim Horton's, a Subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.880]   I think there's a restaurant there somewhere but I never, I didn't get to go.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.960]   You know, stuff like that.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   There's gyms.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960]   You can run around it.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   You feel fairly safe.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.160]   You always have a weapon on you but you can, you know, live your life.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.680]   When you get out to the FOB, the guns are already there.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.600]   So those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.800]   Normally if they're going by air, they go by Chinook 'cause they're heavy as hell.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.200]   And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom and they fly them and then they'll drop them
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200]   down.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.520]   They have wheels on them but you don't need them if you're gonna leave it in place.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520]   Got it.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.680]   And you're getting information about IEDs.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.000]   You're getting a lay of the land as to what's been going on in the country for the past
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.360]   six months.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.520]   And this, you know nothing.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.320]   You're just like, this is your first time.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   You're getting deployed.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.680]   So what was your deployment like?
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.840]   Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.120]   Like the whole deployment?
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.200]   Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.600]   What's the difference between the two?
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.520]   Well actually getting ready to deploy is a little different.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.240]   So I mean the emotional buildup to it.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240]   Got it.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.960]   And some of the memorable things that kind of you remember from that experience both
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.640]   on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get to be part of this and the fear and also
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.720]   like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons and all those kinds of things.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.440]   So like the lead up before everything hit the fan.
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.440]   Okay, cool.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:13.560]   So you're such a fascinating person, but yes.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   Something like that.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.760]   I've been called many things.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.280]   That start with the letter F. Yeah.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.520]   No, I don't know.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.400]   I don't know many words with F. Okay.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.400]   So the buildup to the deployment.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.760]   So for the buildup for the deployment, I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.900]   And at that time you kind of get your marching orders.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.900]   You know you're deploying.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:38.600]   I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.960]   That's how much they needed people.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.240]   So once I did all that training on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.040]   came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted to Bakhia Tse and you're
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.080]   going to deploy with us in April.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.680]   So that's how I found out I was deploying.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.520]   Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.880]   That was a well known thing that there's a scaling up of troops.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.960]   2007 on Canada really started taking a combat role.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.600]   Before it was very much more a UN type deal where doing what we normally do in most wars
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:10.780]   where we just we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.220]   And so we're there to help.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.960]   And so they were really, they were scaling up.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.760]   And there wasn't a lot of people in those trades initially, I think when the war kind
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   of started.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.700]   So Canada really started to scale.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.980]   And so when I got to Quebec, we've kind of found out, yeah, we're deploying.
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:31.280]   And it was a weird situation because I've never actually been at a unit on a non deployable
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280]   unit.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.720]   I don't know what they do day to day that's different from what I did.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.620]   I just know what I did.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.660]   So we would do things like in the morning, we would get up and we would meet for PT at
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.760]   5am.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:48.180]   And that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours in
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.700]   the gym or lifting weights together or, you know, just going on a ruck march, a long ruck
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.460]   march, just stuff like that.
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:59.840]   You would have a shower, you would meet, and then you would just sit around the regiment.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:04.800]   You would just sit around the regiment and you would, if there was busy work, you'd mop
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.160]   the floors, you would clean weapons.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.860]   There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.120]   We did a lot for a while.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.260]   And then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:23.560]   We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was going to be with
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   us.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.840]   Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:34.400]   And so we all would go down to Texas and we did live fire here for a week.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.960]   And I ended up getting gastro, which was awesome.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   So thanks for that.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:43.080]   Oh, apparently there was, they were having water problems and sanitary problems.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.600]   So everyone was getting it on the base.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   Okay.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.880]   So it just makes your life way harder.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.160]   I didn't get it towards the end, till towards the end.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.560]   So that was fortunate.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.360]   So we would fire live fire.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.400]   We would go out to the middle of nowhere.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:01.840]   The guns would be there and we would get offloaded truck of rounds and we would do live fire
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.680]   and we would practice just constant practice.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.920]   What's that saying?
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.120]   Perfect practice makes perfect.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.840]   So this is essentially like a shooting range for artillery, for artillery, for long range.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.240]   So what does practice look like?
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:21.600]   So you roll up in your trucks and you're, you know, you've got each group of people,
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.720]   you've got two trucks and then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.520]   an officer vehicle and a comms vehicle and you, you go to your perspective guns and then
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:36.920]   you offload your ammo and then you basically wait for them to send you like a, a fire mission.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920]   Wow.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   Get that together.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.280]   They would call, they would say, "Mission, sit."
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.560]   So it'd be a fire mission.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   So we'd wait for that.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.360]   And once we got that, then you all run like a bunch of scattered rats to the gun.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.360]   Like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.680]   And then you just wait.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.040]   You wait for the call for the sergeant to say, and then you'll hear it because it's
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040]   not headphones.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.520]   You can hear it on a speaker and it'd be like, I'm not going to do in French, don't ask.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:08.100]   It'd be like, so-and-so 10 rounds, fire when ready.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.280]   And then you would get your rounds ready and everyone would have them ready.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.440]   It would be in their perspective, respective positions and then you would wait and then
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.640]   they would say, "Fire when ready."
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.680]   And as soon as they say fire when ready, that means just start going.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   Just start.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.200]   And then that's when the magic starts.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.400]   You go to like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever.
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   There's a reloading process.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400]   Yep, there's a loop.
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.440]   So what you would do, you get the fire mission, you would find out the rounds.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.120]   The 2IC would be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount of
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:37.720]   rounds that was told would be the only rounds that would go down range.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   And so he'd stand there and on each round, depending on the type of round, is a fuse,
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.240]   which gets screwed onto the top of the round.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.040]   So they're about that big and it's just a point.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.260]   And then you would have to put it on, give it a spin.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:58.080]   And depending if it was a time release, you had a little, what do you call it?
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.120]   You get those at Ikea when you have to build everything.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.120]   Allen wrench?
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   Allen wrench.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120]   But like a big one or something?
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   No, just a little one because it's a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.840]   where it's supposed to go.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.560]   And it depended on what the call was for.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.220]   And it was a timer.
[01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.540]   When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then?
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.540]   Is that what we're talking about?
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.100]   No, no, I'm talking about the round itself.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.500]   So you would put a fuse on top of the round.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.380]   So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:28.620]   And the fuses are on the top and they're like a little, like an ice cream topper kind of
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.620]   thing.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:30.620]   And you would spin those on.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.620]   Oh, okay.
[01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:32.620]   Okay.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:35.260]   And then once they're on, depending if it's a time release or not, you would take this
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.860]   little thing and you would move it, the top.
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.620]   And that would, it's almost like a little timer.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.620]   Cool.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.620]   Yeah, it depended.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.980]   So you were assembling a bullet.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:44.980]   Essentially.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.380]   A very big one that goes up to my waist.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.380]   Cool.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.380]   This is very cool.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:51.380]   And you're a fascinating person.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.380]   Okay.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.740]   So just that you still, even years later, have all this in your memory.
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.140]   It's not all perfectly accurate.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.300]   And that's what irritates me though, is because it bothers me when I can't remember things
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.300]   accurately.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:08.700]   But I've had a lot of memory issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.260]   And this is from earlier in childhood or later?
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   Both.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.260]   Okay.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.260]   Both.
[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:15.260]   The military did not help it.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.860]   Where was the hits in the head in the military?
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.740]   Well, when you have a car, it'll go stuff beside your face like this and it shoots around.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.460]   It gives you a concussive blast.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.700]   Also there's new research being done.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.740]   I'll find out exactly what it is, but there's new research that's being done that shows
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:33.500]   that if you're an artillery gunner and you stand within a certain range of that gun,
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.300]   you get the same amount of concussive blasts.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:36.300]   And there's a range.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:40.140]   I had no idea, but you feel it when it goes off.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.140]   You get hurt.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.820]   Your whole body feels it.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.220]   Your mind is fascinating because it's like literally the opposite of mine.
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.420]   One, you're able to speak very quickly, very clearly, very sharply.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.460]   No, what?
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.700]   I talk too fast and I'm really loud because of my hearing.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.540]   I admire that.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:58.180]   I can't do any of that.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.580]   And you listen extremely well and you're extremely attentive and you have a good memory.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.100]   So anyway, it's just fun to watch you.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.020]   I can tell you were a great soldier in just all different aspects of it.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.020]   Thank you.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.020]   I appreciate it.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.580]   But what the heck we're talking about?
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.020]   Oh, build up to the deployment.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.460]   How did we get to Texas?
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:18.340]   Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.740]   And live fire, you got to...
[01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.740]   Did that feel good?
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:21.740]   Oh yeah.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.740]   It's so good.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:23.740]   What's the favorite?
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:33.420]   What's the best part about shooting artillery?
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.380]   What's the thing that feels good?
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.380]   Which part?
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   Power.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.700]   Well, the feeling of power.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:43.660]   When is the best moment of the highest moment of the feeling of power?
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:48.620]   Is it the whole process that you love or is there like when you actually shoot it?
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:49.620]   It's symbiotic.
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.860]   It's a beautiful thing to watch.
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.500]   To know that a gun can fire and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.940]   There's something about that to me that just got my heart racing.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:06.260]   When you actually shoot the round and you see it go and you hear it, it's unlike it.
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:07.260]   You can't describe.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:09.820]   I've never felt another feeling.
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:14.300]   I've also never been in like an F-18 or an F-16 or like any...
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.420]   I've never been in anything like that.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   And I've never...
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.500]   I'm trying to think of something else that would be comparable.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.460]   I've never been in like a Formula One car.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:27.060]   Those are the only things I can picture being that much for me.
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:32.700]   Because to shoot one of those and to know that you've done your job right means that
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.580]   you've helped.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.840]   And that to me was really what did it for me.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.620]   When you hear your sergeant say, "Mission accomplished.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620]   Target hit.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.620]   Tired acquired."
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.700]   Then you're like, "That's a good feeling.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.060]   That's the stuff."
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.060]   Quick pause.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.060]   Take a break, Lex.
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.060]   Okay.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.860]   So live fire in Texas.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.300]   We're in Texas, by the way.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.020]   Fort Worth or Fort Hood.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.020]   One of them.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.020]   Okay.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.020]   So like it's...
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.020]   Is that close to a big major city?
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:02.140]   Do you remember visiting a city?
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.260]   Oh, God, no.
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:07.380]   We fly right into the tarmac and they're like, "Don't touch the snakes."
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.620]   And then they send you out to the field.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.620]   Got it.
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.620]   Must see the only instructions.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.620]   No, really.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.900]   We went into a classroom and they're like, "These are the animals that are in the wildlife
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   in Texas.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.740]   If you see any of them, do not approach.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.940]   Do not go pee outside.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.940]   Do not squat down.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.220]   It is snake season, people."
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.820]   And I was like, "I have to pee and squat down."
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   Why Texas and from like Canada?
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.820]   Is it a simulation of Afghanistan?
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.820]   Yes.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:32.820]   Okay.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.820]   So then that's...
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.820]   Okay.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:35.820]   So you're getting...
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.220]   And that's the way the live fire was seen in artilleries.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.900]   Like you're trying to simulate certain aspects of what you might actually see in Afghanistan.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.900]   I would think so.
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.740]   I mean, we...
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.340]   It looks like it's hot.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.380]   Like you're out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.820]   Very similar terrain.
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:56.340]   That's the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots and our tan, like our combat
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:58.340]   tan stuff before you couldn't wear that.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:02.100]   So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in how we were going to be doing this, what
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.540]   it was going to look like, how the guns were going to work and all of those lovely things.
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:10.220]   How do you go from there to being deployed?
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.280]   What was the next part of the journey?
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.340]   So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta, often called or referenced as Waynecock because
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:19.700]   it sucks so bad.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:25.020]   It is a massive open space in Alberta, which most of Alberta is.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.320]   And it's outside of a small town called Wainwright.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.800]   And it is a Field X training area for all of the Canadian military.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.120]   And it's where you do live fire, but you also do workup training.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.500]   So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.180]   I don't remember the exact time we were there because it was just...
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.940]   You sleep in a tent, you're in your cot, you're in like full mission mode.
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:53.940]   And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:59.500]   And you put on these little suits, these haptic...
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.040]   You can feel when you're shot.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.900]   And then there's a little screen in the front of it and it's got button options.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:10.620]   And so it's to mimic, if you get shot, it'll say gunshot wound and then you have to choose,
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.420]   "Okay, do I do this or do I do this?"
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.540]   And depending on your response, person dies or lives.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.860]   And they have other people who aren't on a rotation for deployment come and act as the
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:25.980]   Taliban and attack you in the middle of the night.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.580]   - Is there a good understanding of the tactics that the Taliban used to attack?
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:38.500]   I mean, this may be fast forward to our conversation a little bit, but is there predictable strategies
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.340]   on the other side that are being used in Afghanistan?
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.340]   - By the Taliban?
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   - By the Taliban?
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.340]   - Oh, 100%.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:50.780]   They used suicide bombers, vehicle-borne IEDs.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:57.220]   Their standard way to hit people really was IEDs and vehicle-borne IEDs, suicide bombers.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:03.940]   They'd put backpacks full of an IED and then put toys around it and then just be like...
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.340]   - So they would conceal it certain ways and probably use civilians.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.940]   - Oh, 100%, yeah.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:13.300]   And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers because women seem non-threatening.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:18.940]   When you see a burka walk up to you, you're not expecting an AK-47 to roll out of that.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.340]   But there are great ways to get close.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.340]   - Okay, so what is it, Wayne something?
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.340]   - Waynecock?
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.340]   - No, that's not how...
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340]   - Or Wainwright.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.340]   - Wainwright.
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.340]   - Okay, correct.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340]   - Let's go to Alberta.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.340]   - Okay.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.340]   I mean, we don't have to go to Alberta.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:33.340]   No one wants to.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:37.100]   - No, in our minds, in our imagination.
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.820]   So okay, so that's getting you closer to Afghanistan.
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.820]   - Right.
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.100]   - What was that like?
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.060]   I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:45.060]   Is there a buildup?
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.060]   What are you thinking?
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.940]   Or is this just all part of the training?
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.820]   - For me, it was more part of the training.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.700]   I was excited to go because I did know that we were gonna do some live fire.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:17:00.340]   I did know that we were going to be doing more of the military type job I thought we
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:03.900]   were gonna be doing because up until that point, I had just done training.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:07.580]   So I was learning how to march and salute and who to salute and not salute.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:08.620]   That was the focus of...
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.620]   That was my experience of the military.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:14.860]   And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going
[01:17:14.860 --> 01:17:16.380]   for breakfast a lot and drinking.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   Like that was...
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:18.780]   I was like, "This is the army."
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:23.740]   So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well,
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.740]   there's fire picket duty.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.540]   So one person gets picked every night to do sentry.
[01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:30.220]   There's a little less sleep.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.620]   You're eating out of a canteen now.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.620]   You're drinking in a canteen.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.620]   You're in your kit more.
[01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:35.700]   You're in your deployable kit.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:37.320]   Now you're in your...
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.260]   You're wearing your tack vest.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.260]   You're getting ready to practice having plates on.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.340]   You're having ammunition on you.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.020]   You've got your weapon with you all the time.
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.580]   When you're on base in Vacquezay in Quebec, you're just like an everyday job.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:54.140]   Maybe you can paint a clearer picture to me.
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.540]   When was there an understanding that you're actually getting deployed?
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.780]   Was it just a sense that you're getting deployed or was this officially told to you?
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.540]   I was officially told on graduation day, "You're deploying in April with Vacquezay."
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.540]   Oh, there was...
[01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.540]   Okay, there's a date.
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:07.540]   No.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:08.540]   I didn't even knew.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:12.700]   What had happened is the reason that Vacquezay unit needed more people.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.620]   They came to that and they picked five people.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.820]   There was five English speaking people that went to Vacquezay.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.020]   It wasn't just myself.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:21.340]   There was a couple other people I knew that were English speaking that got put on other
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.320]   guns within the regiment.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.880]   I wasn't with any of them.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:29.420]   We all got split up.
[01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:34.220]   There was an understanding that we were going to always be deploying next year.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:36.140]   It was like 2009, you're deploying.
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:41.580]   Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying because that was the rotation time.
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:44.580]   Each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:49.500]   Then you knew right around that point, another base of individuals would then deploy.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.020]   You would go on these rotations.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.580]   Even when I was on my deployment then, I was slated to go again the following year, but
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:58.900]   towards the end of the year.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.020]   There was always a rotation.
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.220]   If you were in a combat arms unit and you were in one that was a deployable unit, so
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:09.660]   if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI, which were the Princess Patricia's, which were their
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:10.920]   infantry unit.
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.400]   If you were RCR out of Petawawa, Ontario, you knew you were deploying.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.060]   If you were at Vacquezay, you knew you were deploying.
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:22.020]   There's combat arms bases and then there's like naval bases.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.540]   I didn't know their deployment structure.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.260]   I didn't know how they worked.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.260]   I'm on the ground.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:27.780]   Don't worry about the boats.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:29.300]   I didn't know how the Air Force deployed.
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.260]   I knew Vacquezay was deploying in April.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:36.060]   You were going, get ready.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.060]   That was that.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.060]   So you show up to Afghanistan.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:43.340]   What is a combat arms unit look like?
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.220]   What's the situation look like?
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.660]   How much chaos is there?
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.460]   How much clarity about mission is there?
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:52.340]   What are your feelings about the whole thing?
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:57.660]   So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec, we got driven to the airport and then
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:01.780]   we walked onto the tarmac and we load our own bags and we got on a plane and it's just
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.780]   empty.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.340]   It's just, it's our plane, right?
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.220]   And you don't go right to Afghanistan.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:09.900]   You go to a stopover point, which I don't know if I'm allowed to say where that is,
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.900]   frankly.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:15.580]   So I just say it's somewhere overseas and you go there and you go there for a couple
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:16.580]   of days.
[01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.780]   I think it's like a day or two and that's where you get like your kit.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.380]   That's where you get your bulletproof plates for the first time and realize how heavy those
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   fucking things are.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.580]   It's where you get your weapon and your ammunition, your first few mags.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:31.340]   It's where you get your helmet and your vests and you get everything that you need while
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.460]   you're there.
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.140]   It's pretty nonchalant.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:35.140]   It's hot as hell.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.020]   It's your first time being in that kind of heat.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.860]   So you just never stop sweating.
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:42.200]   The place we were in, it's just the second you got out of the shower, you were still
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.420]   wet after you got out.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:44.540]   What the hell is happening?
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.100]   It's so humid.
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.660]   And I'm like, "Is this going to be like this in Afghanistan?"
[01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.180]   They're like, "No, it's not humid there at all."
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.180]   I'm like, "Why is it so bad here?"
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.420]   They're like, "It'll be fine.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.940]   Don't worry about it."
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:58.540]   So and where we were there, it was kind of cute.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:04.620]   We were like in a base within a base and they had like turf and we had like ice cream and
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.920]   fruit and you could go get on a computer.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.980]   You could go make calls.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.980]   You had showers.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.980]   You had a real bed.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.560]   It was very kind of okay for that point.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.020]   And then you got all your stuff and then, okay, we're rolling out, which is about a
[01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.020]   five-hour flight.
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:23.380]   Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie,
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.380]   The Predator.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:29.660]   Do you want me to say I've never seen it?
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.660]   I've never seen it, Lex.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.860]   Do you feel better about yourself?
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:37.860]   You want to tell the audience all the excellent shows that you mentioned me offline that you
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.980]   watch instead, instead of Platoon?
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:40.980]   Listen.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.940]   Is Sex and the City, was that more important than Platoon?
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.940]   Oh, no.
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.940]   I've never seen that.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.940]   Don't put me in that category.
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.620]   Did you just put me in a box?
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620]   I did.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   I watch like Homeland.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:56.060]   I watch a lot of documentaries.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.500]   I like to watch real things more than just film.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:05.420]   I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.860]   And I was like, once you've seen how it's made, I'm like, I don't want to do that.
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.740]   I mean, I'm the same way with superhero movies.
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:15.860]   It doesn't, I want something closer to reality.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.180]   But then movies like Platoon reveal some deep aspect of reality without it.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.900]   I did Superman, Man of Steel.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.940]   Wait, sorry, what do you mean you did?
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.220]   I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert, even though I didn't actually have
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.220]   to do any stunts.
[01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.780]   It's just because I had previous military experience and they were going to have me
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:36.620]   as an extra as a military person.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.540]   But if you have previous experience, they have to make it as like a stunt role, like
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.540]   so you get paid more.
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:41.540]   Got it.
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:46.780]   So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that, like, you'd see me like for like two seconds.
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:50.260]   So what you're saying is you were the mastermind behind that movie?
[01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.260]   For the entire thing.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.260]   You're so accurate.
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.260]   Okay, great.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.420]   Your representation of me is just fantastic.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:02.460]   The combat arms unit in Afghanistan, the ice cream machine.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:08.060]   What like when you actually get closer and closer to the mission, when does that happen?
[01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:12.620]   When I got to where we were before we were leaving to get on the plane, I don't really
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.580]   realize, I don't think I realized what the hell I was doing.
[01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:18.420]   Truthfully, like you're asking me all these, like, what did you feel?
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:23.740]   I was like, when I really think about it, if I sit there and really think about it,
[01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:27.860]   I was deploying, I was aware, I knew what I was going to do, I knew my job.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:33.500]   But once we actually stepped onto that Herc to leave to get into the Afghan airspace,
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:34.900]   I think that's when it hit me.
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.260]   I think it smacked me in the face so hard.
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:46.180]   And that's when the overwhelming just reality was that, oh, fuck.
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:54.060]   Oh, oh, oh, when they said, make weapons ready, put the barrel to the ground, put your helmets
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:57.780]   on, that's when they start flying tactically, which means they're going between the mountains.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:01.900]   That means we're going to land soon, which means if you're flying like this, it's because
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.460]   RPGs can hit you.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.740]   So that was my first moment of, oh, I could like just be shot down right now.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.620]   Like, I couldn't, I didn't grasp it.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.740]   I was, how old was I?
[01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.740]   19.
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.740]   19, yeah.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]   Wow.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740]   Okay.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.260]   So that's why I feel bad when I'm trying to explain to you, because it's hard because
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:25.420]   I don't know that I actually did grasp it until I was in the air getting ready to land
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   in Kandahar.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:33.300]   When was the first time you heard bullets, enemy bullets or enemy explosions?
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:38.860]   Well, when you're in Kandahar, when you're at CAF, you're fairly insulated away from
[01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:39.860]   the main walls.
[01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:43.900]   You would hear stuff go off or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.340]   So you would hear the and everyone just kind of got down on the ground and just waited
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.800]   for the all clear and then got back up.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:58.160]   I didn't hear any actual live fire until I got to the FOB.
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.340]   It was more just a lot of noise.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:04.260]   You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes going in and out of the base.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:06.900]   So there was that sense you could feel the ground shake when they took off.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.300]   But there was that sense, you know, things were going around, things were happening.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:17.020]   You just weren't far enough, you were not close enough to the edges of CAF to see it.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.020]   What's the FOB?
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:25.100]   FOB is a forward observation base, which is a small little base out in the middle of wherever.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.380]   And that's specific to artillery?
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.380]   No.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:32.580]   That's in general just an observation base from which combat...
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.540]   For infantry to go in and out of, for armor to go in and out of, special ops go in and
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:37.540]   out of them.
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:38.540]   They fly, they'll stop there.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.140]   They'll pick people up or do whatever, then they'll go out.
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:45.940]   So it's a forward observation base is used essentially to have eyes in that area without
[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.260]   having to be doing patrols every five seconds.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.660]   But there's not, is it like, is there like medics there?
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.700]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.700]   So it was...
[01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.700]   Actual base?
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.820]   Yeah, I was, it's a, I don't call it an actual base.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:01.580]   These sleep in tents and cots and it is, the walls are this mesh material that are filled
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:05.500]   with gravel and that's the walls.
[01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:08.980]   And then you have towers, you had five, I think we had five towers because the Americans
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.860]   ran four and we ran one.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:14.780]   And so it was an American FOB, it's called FOB Ramrod.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:17.940]   And there was a, were there Marines?
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:20.380]   No, I think they were the 101st.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:22.020]   They were out of there.
[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.620]   This is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.020]   So when people are like, "Who are you with?"
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:29.140]   I'm like, "I know what their patches looked like.
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.820]   I don't know the full ins and outs."
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:34.140]   And so I'm working on getting that back so that I can tell it accurately because I believe
[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.820]   it deserves that type of respect.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:40.100]   But that being said, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around all of this.
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:46.740]   Yeah, you almost have to go back and do research to understand the full details of all the
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:47.980]   things you were experiencing.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.900]   And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people even before I wrote the book and I
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.900]   didn't get a lot of answers.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.180]   Well, once I did Jocko, all the people have reached out to me and were like, "Hey."
[01:26:55.180 --> 01:26:56.740]   And I'm like, "Called you."
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:00.420]   So now I'm worried, that's why I'm doing the rewrite is I'm working on making sure that
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.780]   things are exact.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:08.380]   And so there was infantry units going in at that FOB and it was a really tiny FOB.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:14.220]   It was run by the Americans and then there was a tiny little corner that was the Canadian
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:15.980]   artillery unit.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.740]   And the Americans, normally it's Americans shooting for Americans, Canadians shooting
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.740]   for Canadians.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:26.020]   The rest of the regiment that deployed, so Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian FOBs,
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.380]   Massim Guard and another one.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:29.260]   And these were huge FOBs.
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:35.980]   Yours was this tiny like three kilometer around place and we had this tiny little subsection
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:40.340]   of it and the rest was, so it was like this and then all American here.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.380]   And when we got there, we landed, the guns were already there.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.180]   So you ripped out the unit before you.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.380]   So those guys were just leaving and we were just replacing them.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:55.160]   So we knew the guns, they were Canadian guns, we understood how to run those, that was fine.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.880]   When we got there though, we had come in on Chinook and Chinooks are super loud and they're
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.120]   like, "We're hearing protection."
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.300]   They don't, no, this is not reality.
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.600]   This is why I'm partially deaf now, it's not reality.
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:15.920]   - Sorry to take a tangent, but do you usually wear ear protection in any aspects of warfare
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.500]   of this whole process?
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:23.060]   - You wear comms, like you have a comm on and a radio if you're outside the wire.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:25.160]   - So comms is that like a Bluetooth headset?
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.040]   - Yes, it's a Bluetooth headset.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.040]   - Okay.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.040]   - No.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.040]   - Like from Nike or like from AirPod?
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   - I was gonna say Adidas.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.040]   - Okay.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.040]   - Maybe Apple was involved at some point.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.040]   I don't know, this equipment looked like it was from World War II.
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.520]   - So it's comms, but is that having ear protection?
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.520]   - No.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   - No.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520]   - And I didn't wear them.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.720]   That's just what some people wore.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:47.080]   People when you were as low as me, like we weren't privy to conversate, like we were
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.000]   just told what to do and you do it.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.860]   So when you're doing like on the OP tower, you have a radio you pick up and you call
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.420]   in and then you put the radio down.
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:59.560]   But for hearing protection, I mean, I would put in earplugs, but those things are so violently
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.620]   loud that earplugs, they don't do it justice.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:09.780]   - I feel like when you go shooting, there's certain kinds of earplugs that it blocks out
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:15.220]   the gut, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear other types
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220]   of stuff.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.100]   The ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here, but you
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.780]   have to wear your helmet when you're firing.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.340]   - Right, so you can't have both on.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:29.260]   Okay, so how much are you aware of the logistics of the whole thing?
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:34.580]   That's always fascinating with warfare, like in terms of setting up, you mentioned gravel
[01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:37.740]   and the fobs, like setting all those bases up.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:41.940]   Were you seeing any of this or again, it's a 19 year old kind of just-
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:43.620]   - Well, it's not that I was oblivious.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.580]   That's the one thing I would say I wasn't.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.180]   I'm very aware of my surroundings.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:50.500]   That's something that's always been taught to me from a very early age, 'cause I traveled
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.140]   a lot with my dad in the truck.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.940]   And so my dad would be like, "You're gonna go into that bathroom and I'm gonna watch
[01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.980]   you come out and you're gonna watch everyone around you because people get kidnapped."
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:00.700]   Like that's just the reality.
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.300]   I was always very paranoid.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:07.060]   - So you were paying attention to surroundings.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.640]   - But the fob was already built up when we got there.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.220]   - This is already like well-established bases already.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.220]   - Established enough.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:20.060]   - And that is one of the first times you've heard actual fire.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:25.060]   - Yeah, that was like the, I mean, I'd heard it when we shoot and when we zero in weapons
[01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:29.980]   and we do all that stuff, but I had never heard it like that before.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:34.420]   And then you would see the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and go on patrol
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.060]   and come back, roll up, come back, come back.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:40.060]   And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those types
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:45.660]   of things, but I never experienced it because we never got attacked, like our base never
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:46.660]   got hit.
[01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:48.740]   We were really lucky that way.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:52.140]   There were other ones around us that were getting hit, but we weren't getting hit.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.780]   But we were very fortunate.
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.340]   At least we didn't get hit when I was there.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:00.580]   I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.660]   There was an attempt at some point in the past, but I wasn't privy to that.
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:08.180]   But we were in the OP towers, so we had to do our own security.
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:12.020]   But because we were such a small subset of Canadians and we always had to have people
[01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:16.540]   running the guns and ready to run the guns at all times, we only had to man one tower.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:20.700]   So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever,
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.220]   but you would do it every day.
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:26.980]   So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.300]   Otherwise it was just like your walls.
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.700]   What did it look like?
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.100]   Is it beautiful?
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.020]   Just the full landscape?
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.020]   Or is it-
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   It was just where I was.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.540]   There was mountains in the distance.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.540]   It was just very sandy, very flat.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.940]   And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.
[01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.780]   It wasn't a lot to look at.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:47.180]   There was a long road that you knew that got hit all the time.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:49.940]   There wasn't a lot to look at.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:56.060]   Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers over the decades.
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.900]   It really is.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:03.340]   And the fact that the populace, the civilians are almost completely clueless to the full
[01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:08.060]   history of things in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:09.060]   Yeah.
[01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:12.260]   Well, if you look at the location of it, right, on a map, it makes more sense.
[01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.260]   Right.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.460]   You can wrap your brain around it.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:18.540]   But I met plenty of people who had never even seen a picture of themselves when I was in
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.540]   that country.
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.980]   So I mean, how much more are they going to understand if they don't know what even exists
[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:24.780]   outside?
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:31.460]   You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl and showing it to her, an Afghani
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.460]   girl.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.460]   We were, I was with the British at that time.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.580]   And we were on that operation that gets highlighted quite a bit.
[01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:42.740]   And we had stopped and we, the ICOM radios were pinging.
[01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:49.980]   And ICOM radios are a radio that we have an interpreter on that the Taliban, basically
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.420]   we can hear what they're saying.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   It's their comms.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.420]   It's us tapped in.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:56.160]   When it's really clear, they're close.
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.500]   When it's scatty and it's, they're far enough away.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:04.180]   Normally, you know, they're not planning an attack, although you never know, really.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:09.340]   And we were going door to door, kind of like what they're doing now.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.180]   And we were pulling people out of their houses.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:14.060]   And we knew there were, there was people in there that were active Taliban.
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.420]   And we knew the ICOMs were pinging.
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:18.940]   When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids and locked them inside
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:20.460]   the house.
[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:24.980]   Because often nowadays, women, the women, they would hide things on them that they shouldn't
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:28.580]   have because no one would be ever there to search them because there isn't a lot of women
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.340]   on the front lines.
[01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:33.580]   But I got borrowed to go specifically search women and children.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.540]   So they had me.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:39.540]   And one of the little girls kind of snuck out and was kind of sitting near me.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.020]   I was eating something.
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.140]   And I had like these little, these little candies.
[01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.640]   They're called little sweeties.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.020]   The British have them in the ration packs.
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.020]   I don't know.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.020]   They're good though.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.020]   And she saw me eating them.
[01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.900]   And so I gave them to her.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.940]   And then her brother came over and slapped her upside the head and took them from her.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:56.740]   So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head and just pointed my gun at her while
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.740]   she ate them all.
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:01.180]   Because I was like, "No, you can have these.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.940]   I'm going to stand here and make sure you do."
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.780]   And I remember asking, "Can I take a picture with her?"
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:10.620]   I asked the chirp, "Can you ask her, can I take a picture with her?"
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.460]   And she was very confused.
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.940]   When you look at the photo, you see her face.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.940]   She's very stunned.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.940]   She's very stunned.
[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.620]   And it wasn't my camera.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:18.620]   It was my officer's camera.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:22.260]   It was a hot pink, fluorescent pink camera.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:27.420]   So I pulled this huge pink thing and I'm like, "Let's take a picture."
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.300]   And so she stood there and took a picture, but then she grabbed the camera because I
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:32.140]   flipped it and showed it to her.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:36.140]   And her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.980]   And they're like, "Oh, that's gone forever.
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:40.140]   That's over for you."
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.040]   And then she came out and she kind of snuck out.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   And I went in and grabbed it.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.940]   And the mom lifted up her burka and was showing me that she like shaved her legs to be more
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.340]   Western.
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:35:00.260]   And I was just, at that moment, I don't know that I could have realized how much that moment
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:08.240]   affected me, how much that moment would affect me later on in my life until it's been later
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.240]   on in my life.
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:16.900]   There's little like glimmers like that in parts of the world that are basically, you're
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.780]   taking away everything from the populace, like freedoms and so on.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:30.180]   And when you see that glimmer of humanity, like yeah, shaved legs or using technology
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:35.500]   for the first time, it's magic or like food, being presented with certain kinds of foods
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.900]   that you've never tried.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:46.140]   You want to see true joy of discovery is you bring basically the American supermarket,
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.060]   anything from it to most parts of the world.
[01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:56.620]   And I remember even, I mean, we weren't like in poverty in Russia, just poor, but just
[01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.420]   the supermarket was full of joy.
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.980]   I thought I could just die happy in an American supermarket when I first saw it.
[01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:04.700]   And how old were you when you came here?
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:05.700]   13.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.700]   Did you speak English?
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.940]   Yeah, not well.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:11.420]   I thought I never was good at languages.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:17.420]   So it was very much like, why would I need to learn another language?
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.420]   It was that attitude.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:21.420]   It was very like, doesn't, I don't need.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:28.560]   Well, no, I think culturally, not in America, but everywhere else in the world, it's constantly
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:34.980]   kind of seen, it's a good thing to do to learn other languages, especially English, because
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.620]   it's like, that's the language of the world.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:43.100]   And I just thought like, I don't need English to discover the beauty of the world.
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.140]   Like what it is, doesn't like I enjoy life.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.140]   I enjoy soccer.
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:52.220]   I enjoy, I don't remember what else I enjoyed in life, but math, like, why do I need English
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:53.220]   for this?
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:57.460]   So that kind of attitude got me in a lot of trouble when I came here because I couldn't
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:59.220]   You were reluctant?
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.300]   Yeah, but also just couldn't speak well.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:06.180]   And when you move 13 years old, it's middle school, you get made fun of a lot, you get
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:11.260]   bullied and all those kinds of things, which in retrospect is a very positive thing because
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.260]   makes you harder.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.300]   I thought being Russian would be like hard enough.
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.660]   No, well, me, everyone is different.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:23.980]   I mean, the part of the Russian thing is, it's kind of, I'm joking because if you know
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:27.780]   me, I admire being hard.
[01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:31.340]   I admire fighting and these kinds of things, right?
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.780]   These, what would you call them?
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:37.060]   People in all of its forms, martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.
[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.020]   But ultimately, I'm so much about love.
[01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:46.460]   I'm clearly sensitive to the world in some weird genetic way that it was important for
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:52.260]   me to harden up when I came here and I was in love with people and it's like, and everybody's
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:53.260]   being mean to me.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.260]   And it's like, what?
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:38:01.740]   It's a little like, slap, like, okay.
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:03.020]   Life is not often fair.
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:07.660]   And then that's when for me personally, everybody has different journeys of hardship that are
[01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:09.020]   much, much more difficult.
[01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:12.820]   Like your story is much more difficult.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.620]   I started to read a lot.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.860]   It's like something happens, some kind of challenge where you start to think about the
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:21.220]   world, start to think about yourself.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.740]   That can ultimately create really interesting minds.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:28.620]   It can break some people, it can create interesting minds and it's ultimately your choice.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.940]   But those people are weak and then they just need to be weeded out.
[01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.260]   I thought we talked about this.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:35.780]   The strong will survive, the weak will die off.
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:38.620]   Now you're talking Russian to me.
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.860]   I'm not speaking Russian.
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:43.860]   I'm just giving solid life advice.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.860]   Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.460]   That's your inner David Goggins coming out real quick here.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.460]   Okay.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:52.460]   The Fob.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.300]   And then I was just explaining to you that the way it is run, you're going to love this.
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:01.820]   When we walked up to those tents for the first time, the people that were there before us
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.100]   left us a noose.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.100]   I have a photo of it.
[01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:11.820]   Like hanging from the tent, like at the front of the tent, like, "Welcome."
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.180]   So you were also mentioning the dark humor of it.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:17.500]   It was basically a funny joke.
[01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:18.500]   Correct.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.500]   It was funny at first.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.500]   That's pretty funny.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.660]   It was funny during the time.
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:26.660]   Now when I look back at it, I was like, "Come on."
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:30.220]   I mean, I get it because they had already been there.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:34.520]   So afterwards I can see how it's funny.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:39.180]   Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community now, I'm like, "Oh, I don't post
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.180]   that photo."
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.180]   Really?
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:45.580]   So doesn't that dark humor still somehow help even when you're considering suicide?
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.580]   Doesn't that, some of it, somehow-
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.580]   Makes it copable.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.580]   Somehow, yeah.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.860]   It's like you're not hiding it.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:59.980]   It's like humor is one of the way to reveal the reality of abuse, of suffering.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:04.060]   If you look at, there's this photo that generates right around suicide prevention month, which
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.900]   is September.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.860]   And it's always like a photo of Robin Williams and Bourdain and all of these other individuals
[01:40:10.860 --> 01:40:13.780]   who were comedians who all took their lives.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.580]   And they're all smiling.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:19.120]   And they're like, "This is the face of depression."
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:26.500]   There's a way our brains work where humor is a necessary part of survival, whether it's
[01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:31.800]   used for joyous things or it's used for ways to cope through life.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.260]   For me in the military, humor was one of the things that helped get me through.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:43.620]   And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor makes some of the horrific things I
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:47.140]   say not seem so horrific.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:52.740]   And people can digest it rather than being like, "You need to be locked up somewhere."
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:41:01.620]   Yeah, that's why one of the aspects of Russian humor, there's a darkness to it because through
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:06.380]   it reverberates all the millions of people who died.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:10.300]   And it seems like the only way to make sense of it is to joke about it.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.300]   I still love it.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.740]   Because if you don't, it'll break you.
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:14.740]   Something like that.
[01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:22.060]   Or also humor just seems to be the highest form of us humans and the human experience.
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:28.580]   It just seems to somehow accumulate the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:29.580]   of it.
[01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:36.180]   Because ultimately all of the suffering, it's all just apes fighting for power and love
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:39.940]   and somehow torturing each other in the process.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.660]   Hello podcast listener, Lex here.
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.620]   Quick intermission to say that some of the names in the following story have been silenced
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.900]   out to protect their privacy.
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:42:01.660]   The story of witnessing, I think your first, somebody you met, somebody you saw, somebody
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:08.380]   you began to be close with, his life, him dying.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.300]   Can you tell the story?
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.060]   Sure.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.540]   That's no problem.
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:20.940]   I will tell you that I am going to leave some of the names out of the people because they
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.980]   have reached out and asked that I do such.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:28.460]   I've also been informed of other things I forgot that happened during the thing that
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.140]   were way worse than I thought.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:34.660]   So I'll try to add those in because that's new information to me because my brain has
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:35.660]   blocked it out.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:39.740]   But I've been told, which is good because it's better detail.
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:47.020]   So we were doing a movement that morning and we were going from compound to compound.
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:49.740]   I was never told what we were doing.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.180]   I knew what my job was.
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:53.860]   I didn't know the operational overview.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:56.900]   I didn't know who we were looking for.
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.060]   I wasn't there for that.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:03.340]   My job was specifically to look after the women and children and to provide support
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.060]   if need be.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:11.460]   And when you have certain people, so the IE, the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog, and
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:16.500]   then you have the medics, and then you have like a female searcher, there's only one of
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:20.020]   those in each unit or if there's even one in each unit.
[01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:26.180]   I got passed between units so that they could have access to me for both.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.500]   And we were kind of sitting and we were waiting for the all clear to move.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:37.740]   And at that time, the compound wall I was leaning up against, I had my back up against,
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:42.180]   I wasn't facing the direct direction where it actually blew up.
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:46.940]   I had my back to it and I had happened to turn and look to the left.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:52.060]   And on the right hand side, across the road of where we were leaned up against, was another
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:59.720]   compound two stories high, people inside, a sniper on the roof, and a spotter.
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:02.780]   There was a handful of us on this wall.
[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:07.660]   And in front of me, there was a road.
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.580]   The road went straight.
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:10.580]   That compound's here.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:13.380]   There's another road here on the right hand side in front of it.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.340]   And then this road went along here.
[01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:21.200]   And this was a wide open space, just a huge, we hate those.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.800]   You hate those because it's too much space.
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:24.800]   It's too easy.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.440]   It's like fish in a barrel.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.740]   You don't want to be in that field.
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.100]   Because there's too much line of sight.
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:33.660]   Line of sight, could be IEDs.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.140]   It could be anything.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:46.100]   And so when I was leaning up against the wall, we had sent a couple people ahead to go and
[01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.500]   clear the road so that we could all go along it and then clear the grape hop off to the
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.460]   left hand side.
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:57.360]   And you're doing that because they use those locations to put IEDs so that when you're
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:03.160]   going to search it, it's a better chance of you blowing into a million pieces, essentially
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:04.640]   why they love that.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.000]   Put bombs in small places, send people into small places, small places go boom, they paint
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.580]   the walls.
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.560]   So we were just kind of sitting and waiting.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:19.120]   And then I happened to turn and I was looking in that direction and I heard the ground shake
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.400]   before I even realized what I was seeing with my own eyes.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:30.420]   The ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body.
[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:37.820]   I think it was the torso just kind of fly through the air and land into the field.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.880]   And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.980]   It was like they were sitting and watching and waiting and they do that.
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:45.980]   And I say they, I mean the Taliban.
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:46.980]   They do that.
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.060]   They love that because then they can record it for propaganda and they can use it against
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:55.260]   us and they just love being able to take our people out.
[01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:59.940]   And we had the interpreter sitting beside me and he had the Icom radio on.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:05.260]   And as soon as the blast went off, I heard just the scream of "Allah, Allah, Allah."
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:06.980]   Like I just, I heard it.
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:13.940]   And I knew what that meant, but I couldn't, I didn't understand what was about to happen.
[01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:20.780]   I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my brain around what was about to happen because I had never
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:23.980]   been outside the wire.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:29.260]   And people are like, people say to me now, they're like, "No, no, there's no way that
[01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.260]   shit's true.
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:33.420]   There's no way that she was involved in that and then that and then in that and then in
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:34.420]   that."
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:35.580]   Well, let me explain.
[01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:37.780]   I was one person.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.260]   I was being passed around to units.
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:46.140]   I was with a ton of different people.
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:52.740]   I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.940]   And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet, it felt like.
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:02.300]   And then I found out later it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.860]   So that made me feel better because then I was like, well, I have a lot of survivor's
[01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:06.860]   guilt.
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:08.380]   That's like a thing that's still stuck with me.
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:13.140]   I've worked through a lot of shit, but survivor's guilt, that's a big one for me.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.660]   Certain food is a big one for me.
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:16.220]   Certain food.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:21.260]   Yeah, skin on food.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:24.700]   So like chicken with skin on it?
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:27.260]   Just because of the biology of death?
[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:28.260]   Just what's-
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:32.100]   Well, when you hold people's bodies in your hands with no gloves on, you know what that
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.100]   feels like.
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.180]   And when you touch raw meat again, it's the same thing.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:40.380]   That's what that feels like when it's a dying or dead body?
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:45.660]   Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces, so I just had pieces of him.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:55.500]   So there was no differentiator of like, this was his thigh or this was his torso or there
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:58.020]   was like, there was none of that.
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:02.860]   There was only one instance with the boot.
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:07.580]   But at that point, we had been in some firefights.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:14.740]   We had been taking some rounds, but it was more like, we'd get hit and then we'd duck
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:18.500]   into a compound and we would set up and then we'd be firing.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:21.620]   I wasn't really involved in a lot of the firefights until after this.
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:25.820]   After that, the rest of the week, I was angry and I wanted them all to go.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.580]   And I wanted to be in every position to take them out myself.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.660]   So I put myself in every position.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:31.940]   So I made sure I was on the roof.
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:33.020]   I made sure I was there.
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.420]   I made sure, "Hey, you need something?
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   I'll fucking run it.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.460]   I don't care if I die anymore."
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:38.820]   Because as soon as that happened, my light switch went off.
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.900]   It didn't matter anymore to me.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:42.500]   - Can you go through what happens?
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:46.260]   - Yeah, so- - Akbar, you were hearing these screams.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:54.340]   - Yeah, so the IED went off and what had happened was they put an IED inside of a grape hut
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:58.580]   and the grape hut has rectangular holes in the wall.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:03.260]   And there's just like one door and it's this tall mud hut with just all these like holes
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:05.020]   in it.
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:11.220]   And they had put an IED underneath a pile of sticks and had a metal detector.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.220]   The Brits carry them.
[01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:15.980]   I've never seen, I think other countries have them, but I've only ever seen them use it.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:19.180]   And that's how we were kind of detecting if there was an IED.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.700]   We must have hit it, the sticks or something, and it set it off.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.620]   And it just, it was over.
[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:25.620]   There's no way he felt anything.
[01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:30.900]   And then there was another guy at the door, bent down on one knee, and he was facing and
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.900]   kind of watching for, and then a blast hit him on this side.
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:38.660]   And so it took him out and pulled his kit off, pulled his helmet off, pulled everything
[01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.260]   off, fucked him all up, big time.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:43.300]   - This is one IED.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:49.940]   - Yeah, but it was in a contained area and he was in the doorway, up and out.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:54.260]   - Can you explain what an IED is and how does it work?
[01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:55.260]   - I can do my best.
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.420]   They're improvised explosive devices.
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:00.780]   They can be used pretty much out of anything to make anything.
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.780]   So garbage.
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:05.740]   When we got to Afghanistan, they did the IED meeting with us.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.420]   They're like, "These are what we're finding."
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:09.380]   They would show us diffused IEDs.
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:14.260]   So they would see those big blue drums filled with gasoline buried in the ground.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:15.560]   You would see a wire.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.020]   It would go to a pressure plate.
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:20.660]   You hit the pressure plate, that would hit that, and it would go.
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:22.540]   You would see IEDs.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.540]   Some of them are ridiculous.
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:29.700]   The engineering that went into some of these was hilarious because they were thinking.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.940]   They were thinking to use everything they could.
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:34.740]   There was a cigarette pack they had used.
[01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:37.180]   They lined the inside with tin foil.
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:40.300]   And when you stepped on the tin foil, it had a piece of wire and it was enough of a spark
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.860]   to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown out that were all dead.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:47.260]   When you fuse them all together, there was enough juice to make it go.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:52.100]   Then they would attach that to like phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they could that would
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:53.980]   make a big boom.
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:54.980]   They would use...
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.900]   Yeah, that's why you never kick garbage on the ground.
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.940]   You'll never see me kick something on the ground.
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.340]   You'll see me walk around it always.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:05.860]   If I ever see a pile of rocks or something that looks like it shouldn't be there, I won't
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:11.900]   walk near it, even now, because they use that pile of rocks to remind people there's something
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:12.900]   there.
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:14.900]   We don't know what that means, but we know that something's there.
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:20.100]   Very often, they would use anything, garbage, wires.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:24.260]   We had to burn everything for a reason.
[01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:33.180]   It's so terrifying for the source of death to be little parts of the environment and
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:38.500]   then people that don't look like they're not dressed as soldiers.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:39.500]   No, they are.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.820]   It's like civilians and regular...
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:47.460]   Because then when you have to come back or even there, you're just surrounded by danger
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:50.540]   and then you distrust everything, essentially.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:54.780]   That's the problem and that's why you have such PTSD issues with the soldiers we have
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:52:02.500]   now because you're in the environment in which it's very similar.
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.980]   There's this one IED.
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:10.020]   This one IED, I still don't know what it was, went off, body flew.
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:13.420]   The guy at the door, he kicked out.
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:19.420]   He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:22.340]   At that point, the radio started going crazy.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:25.340]   I could hear the guys yelling and screaming, trying to figure it out.
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:27.140]   Then you could hear the numbers being called.
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.660]   KIA, number, number, number, number.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.180]   I don't know anybody's service number.
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:33.780]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:38.980]   Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down and live fire starts happening.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:42.580]   I'm like, "Holy fuck, things are popping off."
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:45.740]   I remember just looking at it and being like, "We need to go.
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.740]   We need to go now."
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:50.900]   I just got this like, "We're going."
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.900]   They're like, "Hold on, Burns."
[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:53.940]   I'm like, "We're fucking going."
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.740]   I wasn't dealing with it well.
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.780]   They're like, "All right, all right, go.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.860]   Go, go, go, go, go."
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:09.500]   We went and I helped out with that other individual, held him down, started doing medic work on
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:10.500]   him.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:11.500]   He just kept saying, "Where's the medic?
[01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:12.500]   Where's the medic?
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.500]   Where's the medic?"
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:14.500]   He was in such a state of shock.
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.700]   I've never seen somebody's eyeball so big in my life.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:17.700]   He's going, "Where's the medic?
[01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:18.700]   Where's the medic?
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:19.700]   Where's the medic?"
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700]   I'm like, "He's good, buddy.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.700]   He's good.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:22.700]   He's good."
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:26.420]   Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though because these guys were just, oh, and
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:29.140]   when they talk fast, it's even worse.
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:33.300]   And then so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch along the side of the road
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.540]   because the road hadn't been cleared.
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:42.300]   And we're running through these tall, they look like cannabis plants, but they're not.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.900]   But it's just very thick bush.
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.420]   And I felt like I was running in slow motion.
[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:51.300]   So if you picture one of your video games where like the tunnel vision and you can hear
[01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:56.500]   your breathing is like that and you're running and you can't move fast enough and you're
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:00.420]   like trying to get there.
[01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:05.420]   And we hit the road and the rounds are coming down and mortars are coming down.
[01:54:05.420 --> 01:54:06.740]   And they're like, "Okay, on three, run."
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.660]   So we run on three and we run into the compound, I mean, into the Great Putt.
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:17.460]   And I remember looking around and very seriously going, "Where is he?"
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:21.140]   Just genuinely asking, I think it was...
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.780]   Been messaging me and he's been incredible.
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.960]   He's one of the best soldiers I've ever served with.
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:30.020]   He was a higher up, so he was running part of this.
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.300]   He's messaged me and he was giving me some information.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:34.500]   And he's like, "I was in there with you."
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.660]   And he goes, "I remember because you handed me the boot."
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:40.380]   And because I walked over and all the rounds were...
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:44.700]   We were being shot at, mortars were coming down, but it was this slow motion.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:53.900]   And I remember walking over to the hole in the ground and seeing his boot in the ground.
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:54.900]   But it was...
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:58.900]   His leg was still hanging, just below his knee was still in it.
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:01.500]   But the boot was perfectly laced up.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.860]   The boot was fine.
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:09.220]   And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys and I was like, "We could reuse
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.220]   the boot."
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:16.420]   - Now, that wasn't even...
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:17.420]   What is that?
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:26.500]   Was that actually an intelligent attempt at humor or was it some kind of deeply lost,
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.740]   like you were completely just lost?
[01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:29.940]   - I think my brain broke.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:35.180]   I think that's the moment I call my light switch went off.
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.700]   - Did you understand that he was dead at that point?
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:45.180]   Like intellectually, you were just something that just broke?
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:48.700]   No emotion, like it just broke.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:52.620]   - It just shattered.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.620]   It shattered.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.620]   I felt it happen.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:55.620]   Felt.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:56:06.020]   I didn't feel anything.
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:08.500]   It just broke.
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:15.140]   - And at that moment, because later there's some anger almost, at that moment, none of
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.140]   that.
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:17.260]   - I couldn't comprehend what happened.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:23.020]   I knew he wasn't there anymore because they looked at me and said, "What's here is here.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.300]   Start grabbing pieces.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:26.460]   We need to fucking move."
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:32.780]   And so I handed the boot over, they took it, and then I started just grabbing anything
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:38.700]   out of the walls because those little rectangulars just had flesh hanging from it.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:43.020]   And I didn't have my gloves on because I only used them to search.
[01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.380]   - So you want to bring everything back.
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.380]   - Everything.
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.820]   You didn't want to leave.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:55.180]   - This is what, even if they're dead, do you want to save those you served with?
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:57.220]   - Yeah, because they deserve that.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:00.420]   They don't deserve to have a piece of them drugged behind a truck for propaganda.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.420]   It's not fair.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:07.300]   - What did the others, I mean, was there just a focus on mission or was there a panic?
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:08.980]   - No panic with these guys.
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:13.660]   These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers I've ever seen in my life.
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:19.660]   We started grabbing and remind me, he said, "You know, you," that's not, he goes, "When
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:21.980]   people say that's the worst part of your day, that wasn't even the worst part of your day.
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:27.180]   Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?"
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:29.700]   No.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:34.700]   No, I do though.
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:36.300]   Thank you for that.
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:39.060]   - So there's parts you don't even, they're just not.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:42.340]   - They don't register.
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:45.780]   Because I had some people contact me and be like, "You didn't tell it right.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:51.660]   And war is subjective and war is from your perspective and war is messy and horrific
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:58:03.340]   and war is graphic and violent and painful."
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.300]   Your brain remembers what it wants to remember and your brain allows you to remember what
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:12.660]   it allows you to remember and there's reasons that you don't remember everything.
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:17.660]   And so we were getting, we were really getting hit.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.860]   We were getting, it was bad.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:23.340]   And some of the guys, machine gunners had come up to do cover fire.
[01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:30.340]   And I know we were calling in for air support to come pick up the guys because they had
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:32.420]   to go.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:37.580]   And we just collected everything we could.
[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.460]   But I did remember screaming, "We didn't get them all.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:40.460]   We didn't get them all.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:41.460]   There's no way we got them all.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.460]   We did not fucking get them all."
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.540]   And I remember one of the guys looking at me being like, "We got them.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.540]   We got them."
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:46.540]   I'm like, "We didn't fucking get them.
[01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:47.540]   We didn't get them."
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.540]   He's like, "No, we got them."
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.780]   And I couldn't say it enough.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:56.300]   And so I grabbed as much as I could.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:58:59.100]   I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap.
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:03.480]   And I had his helmet and someone else's helmet in my arm.
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:09.980]   And then I had my weapon in front of me and I was carrying it.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:13.700]   And then we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:16.700]   Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:20.060]   And there was a couple guys in front of us and there were a couple behind me and I was
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.540]   kind of in the middle.
[01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:24.380]   And we said, "Okay, we're just going to have to run.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:25.380]   We're going to have to fucking run the road.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.380]   We're going to have to run it.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.380]   We're going to have to chance it."
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:28.380]   So we ran it.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:30.380]   And that was the closest...
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:36.100]   Well, I guess not the closest, but it felt like it was the closest I could hear the whiz
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:39.020]   of the rounds going by me.
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:44.020]   It's a weird noise when they're coming at you than when they're leaving you.
[01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:47.900]   And so that slowed everything down for me.
[01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:51.460]   And then one of the guys accidentally dropped the edge of the stretcher and everything fell
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.020]   off into the ditch.
[01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:56.420]   And then we had to go back down and get it back up.
[01:59:56.420 --> 02:00:01.100]   So we kept running and we finally got back into the compound that that sniper was sitting
[02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:05.220]   off on the right hand side and we got all in there.
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:06.220]   And I know the...
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:09.020]   I think he said there was two flights.
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:12.660]   I only thought there was one, but apparently there was two flights.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:15.380]   So he went on one, his body went on one.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:19.060]   And then I think he said went on the other.
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:21.460]   And then they took off.
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:25.660]   And then when they leave, though, they rain hell down on anything they can see on the
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:26.660]   ground.
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:30.460]   And that is a beautiful sight because they had mortar rounds coming down and it just
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:33.100]   was getting really, really bad.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:41.220]   And then as soon as the Blackhawks took off, all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet,
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:44.820]   like deafening quiet.
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:48.660]   And we were sitting inside the compound and one of the medics looked at me and you could
[02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:53.580]   see and I still do it now and I'm working on not doing it, but I do it when I get really
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.700]   overwhelmed because I didn't have any gloves on.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:00.460]   I had blood all over my hands and just like body and stuff.
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:05.340]   So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer and I started rubbing.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:11.180]   And so I rub, I do this when I'm stressed, I'll rub my hands.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:15.580]   And I still can't do...
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.940]   I still can't eat food with skin on it.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:20.420]   And I can't like salmon and stuff.
[02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:21.420]   Like I can't...
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:22.860]   Anything with skin, I can't touch it.
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:28.420]   And if I'm making meat at home, like for my husband and my son, I have like meat gloves
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:31.420]   and then I have like a fork and a knife and I'm like cutting it.
[02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:32.420]   Like I never touch it.
[02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:34.700]   I can't touch it.
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:43.540]   So there's something almost like the texture of the biology of a human flesh that just...
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:45.440]   That's at the level of...
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.140]   That's the level of your trauma.
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.140]   And it's been...
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:50.140]   I mean, it's 2021.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.420]   This was in '09.
[02:01:51.420 --> 02:01:57.180]   And I've worked on this like, and I mean, I've been in like treatment religiously just
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:00.460]   to be able to keep me alive for this decade.
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:04.060]   And so it's not like it's like, "Oh, I've never even tried to get better."
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.420]   It's like, I never used to leave my house.
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:10.260]   I used to call people that look like that horrific names in public.
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.640]   I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.380]   I'm a fairly happy individual now.
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:19.140]   What about...
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:25.580]   You're talking about sort of skin and parts, but there's also just the fact that we're
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:31.140]   mortal and there's somebody close to you who dies.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:34.260]   Who you watch walk up and then never come back out again?
[02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:35.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:40.580]   It's like you're facing mortality in a very real way.
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:46.020]   In a way that's not the same as somebody dying from cancer in a hospital, although it has
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:52.020]   echoes of that because that's also absurd and it doesn't feel like there's justice to
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:56.300]   it in any kind of way, but it's so sudden.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:03.540]   Have you been able to make sense of that, of your feelings about it?
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.380]   How do you feel about it?
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:14.220]   Or is everything just shrouded in this trauma that you're not able to just feel for the
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:19.700]   loss of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:22.380]   I think I had...
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:28.540]   When I realized he wasn't there, when I realized that he...
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:31.900]   That was what was left of him.
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:37.740]   I found out afterward there was other parts that were outside and went back.
[02:03:37.740 --> 02:03:40.660]   I think he said went back and they got...
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:43.180]   They ended up getting the rest of him.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:50.060]   So that made me happy because I just found this out this week.
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:57.860]   So that means you have a feeling like you still feel like parts of him were left behind.
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:07.900]   On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind, literally I lost my mind and I was screaming
[02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:10.260]   that he wasn't all in there.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:19.940]   I'm happy now knowing that he was, but I held onto that for 10 years.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:28.940]   The sandbags, the bulk of the weight is not from human flesh.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:33.620]   He was a young kid too.
[02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.620]   I think it was his first deployment as well.
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:45.620]   He was a young kid and he was just going to clear the road for the rest of us.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.060]   You know you're in war and you know that you're outside the wire and you know things could
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:50.860]   happen.
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:56.620]   You understand that to the extent you can understand that.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:59.700]   When it's happening, it's something very different.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:09.060]   Also maybe you can correct me, but there's something much more brutal about an IED versus
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:11.220]   like a bullet.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:14.220]   Because a bullet, you still...
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:21.500]   Watching somebody close to you die from a bullet, you still get the basic humanity.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:27.100]   So IED basically converted a human being into biological parts.
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:33.620]   Yeah, I mean, I don't...
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.580]   That's tough.
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:43.620]   That's tough because it's hard for you to remember them as a human.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.980]   You remember them as parts.
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:48.420]   For me, that's how I remember him.
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:49.780]   I would like to...
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:52.780]   I have a picture that I post every year about him.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:06:00.660]   I see that, but I don't put two and two together.
[02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:01.660]   Does that make sense?
[02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.220]   Yeah, no, it does.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:08.660]   So even I, listening to your story, thank you for sharing it, first of all.
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:09.660]   It's fine.
[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:10.660]   It's not my...
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:11.660]   It's...
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:12.660]   Well...
[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:13.660]   I'm just the one to tell it.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:14.660]   I was just involved.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:19.420]   One set of eyes on this particular human being.
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:20.940]   But even I get angry.
[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:24.060]   I can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger.
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:25.060]   I'm sorry.
[02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:26.060]   I look always exhausted.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.060]   Oh, that's okay.
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:30.740]   You're into robotics, isn't that like your guys' thing?
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:32.340]   You guys are just always working on tech?
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:36.900]   I think because I feel so much for the world, I just don't do...
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:39.540]   We were talking about resting bitch face earlier.
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:45.280]   I just don't feel the need to maintain all the effort of the musculature for presenting
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.620]   myself to you visually.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:47.620]   It's exhausting.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:48.620]   It's exhausting.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:49.620]   So I just focus on the feeling.
[02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:50.620]   No, hey, I...
[02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:51.620]   I'm gonna move back.
[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:52.620]   Face show, whatever the hell it shows.
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:53.620]   Fair enough.
[02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:55.060]   Okay.
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:56.340]   Was there anger?
[02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:57.340]   Was there hate?
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:06:58.340]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:03.060]   Can you just talk through your feelings of what you remember?
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:04.060]   Yeah.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:10.940]   So after that operation with the British, I went back to the Canadians.
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:16.540]   And I didn't go back as even remotely close to who I was when I left.
[02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:22.180]   And that was really troublesome for a lot of people around me because the level of anger
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:28.580]   and hate that came out of me was palpable when I just walked by.
[02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:31.660]   I got shockingly quiet.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:33.780]   You understand how you're learning how...
[02:07:33.780 --> 02:07:36.940]   You'd be terrified if you were quiet.
[02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:41.740]   And I don't know if hate and anger do that justice.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:47.820]   I don't know another word, but I don't think those two words do it justice to the extent
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:48.820]   that I was feeling.
[02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:54.780]   Like I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman with some scissors.
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:59.100]   Like the idea crossed my mind, like I could bootstomp her to death and not feel anything
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.860]   about it in front of her, all of her family and her kids.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:06.780]   Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity or was it legit hatred?
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:08.940]   No, it was legit hatred.
[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:13.420]   But also I no longer saw those people as humans.
[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:14.740]   It took one event.
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:21.180]   And when that happened, the rest of the operation, that was echoed in the way I was to those
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:22.180]   people.
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:27.020]   But to what level can you see those people as human?
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:28.020]   So this is where...
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:29.020]   Now?
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:30.020]   Well, like this is where things...
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:32.340]   Jaco shut down.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:34.780]   Oh God.
[02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:37.300]   I still think I'm right.
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:42.380]   There's a Dire Straits song called Brothers in Arms.
[02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:48.620]   And actually, anyway, we're fools to make war on our brothers in arms.
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:55.860]   And I brought that up to Jaco because it's humans on both sides.
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:09:00.900]   But he said, not in Iraq.
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:04.580]   Like to him, he's like, no, that's the enemy.
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:07.700]   These are people who use the civilians.
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:13.980]   They rape, they torture, they'll do anything and they put evil onto the world.
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:21.460]   And then it's like, so there stood at that moment, like these two were humans and it's
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:26.620]   politicians waging war and it's kids on both sides.
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:29.260]   But then Jaco's like, no.
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:31.260]   He's not wrong.
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:32.700]   So which...
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:36.220]   Can you carry both things with you as a soldier?
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:40.300]   I think when I was a soldier, I could only carry one thing with me.
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:48.020]   I think my perspective has changed drastically, but not because I've lost the reality that
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:54.020]   they are the enemy, but I've gained my humanity back again.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:55.940]   And that's what I lost when I was there.
[02:09:55.940 --> 02:09:57.140]   I lost all humanity.
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.540]   I lost all hope for humanity.
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:01.260]   He's not wrong.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:08.460]   When he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq, but for me, the Taliban are evil.
[02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:15.220]   I still hold a spot of hatred for them that could set this building on fire.
[02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:16.220]   You don't...
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:18.580]   I don't know that anybody can fully understand that.
[02:10:18.580 --> 02:10:26.940]   When you watch what they do to women and to kids and they do it in the name of God, they
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:28.080]   are the enemy.
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:32.220]   They are less than, they don't exist.
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:36.300]   They're barely worth the bullets we put into them.
[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:38.420]   But then because they use civilians-
[02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.780]   It gets dicey.
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:47.100]   So like then everybody becomes the enemy and how are you supposed to make sense of that?
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:48.100]   Like what...
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.100]   But here, Lex, you can't make sense of it.
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:51.260]   This is why.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:54.340]   They've done a really good job of blending into the civilian population.
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:55.420]   They've done it intentionally.
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:57.740]   They've done it on purpose.
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:10:59.420]   So they're brilliant.
[02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:01.060]   This is why you guys couldn't beat them.
[02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:03.420]   This is why we couldn't fucking beat them.
[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:07.380]   They use their people so effectively.
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:08.840]   They have no shame in that.
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.260]   They have no issue with that.
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:15.460]   They take no qualms with wiping a kid off the face of the earth if it means they can
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:20.260]   get close enough to a soldier to throw a fucking bomb into their tank.
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:22.100]   This is why they're effective.
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:23.820]   How do you beat them then?
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:30.900]   There's no winning that you just basically do policeman type work or you do your best.
[02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:33.260]   I mean, that's one way.
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:38.620]   So the other is you come from an artillery background.
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:42.500]   A fucking Hellfire missile hits the whole place off the face of the earth.
[02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:45.220]   You can't beat radicalism like that right now.
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:48.820]   The problem is we've let it go unchecked.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:52.280]   We had it kind of in check for 20 years.
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.820]   We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest, and the face.
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:12:07.320]   So the problem with force is it creates long-term hate because young kids and propaganda and
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:09.140]   like propaganda works.
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:14.340]   So you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.
[02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:19.400]   It's very easy to convince that person that they died because of evil Americans and tell
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.180]   whatever story you want about America or Russia.
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:23.380]   That's the biggest problem.
[02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:30.020]   So it seems like there got to be better solutions because I mean, I talk about love, but it's
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:38.940]   honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways of empowering women, of educating people,
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:39.940]   and not in a--
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:43.620]   Not a cheesy way, but in a realistic.
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:49.400]   In the same level of mass warfare, but with love.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:56.020]   So you're talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets, but do that where you educate and
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:59.620]   empower women by force.
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:00.620]   They want to learn.
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:01.620]   Right.
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:03.420]   I mean, you're not forcing anybody.
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.100]   You're setting them free.
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:06.180]   That's exactly it.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:07.460]   Combat Flip Flops does this.
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:08.460]   They do this.
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:10.040]   They give literacy.
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:15.860]   They teach girls to read, nothing else, to read because as soon as you can read, you
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:18.220]   know what happens then.
[02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:19.580]   What's Combat Flip Flops?
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:23.440]   That's the scarf right there that's made in Afghanistan.
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.320]   So when you buy something from them, the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.760]   They've given literacy to 800 girls over there.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.640]   Yeah, they're really cool.
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:37.080]   Griff owns the one, he was an army ranger and his buddy, Lee I think is his name.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.160]   They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they do shoes and I think they're called shamongs.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.760]   I don't know how to say it properly.
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.040]   Built in Afghanistan.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.040]   Yes.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:48.360]   So the proceeds go back there.
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.980]   They do great work for literacy and you know as well as anyone, if you can teach someone
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:54.980]   to read-
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.080]   Good color.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:58.080]   Dark like your soul, Lex.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.080]   On the inside.
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:00.080]   Just on the inside.
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.080]   All right.
[02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:02.080]   The outside is just the suit.
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:09.700]   I feel like you think that's your suit of armor, but I feel like it's- See?
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:10.700]   What were you saying?
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:11.700]   Sorry, what were you saying?
[02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:12.700]   I was saying-
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:13.700]   Go on, I will allow this.
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:14.700]   All right.
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:15.700]   I think-
[02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:20.940]   I think there is room if you teach education.
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.820]   The problem is we've taken a massive step backwards.
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:31.160]   I know that the Taliban have just instituted this week, honor killings will be back, stonings
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.260]   are back and dismemberments as well.
[02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:37.980]   Holly McKay is the reporter that's been reporting that from the ground.
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:39.340]   She's still there.
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:45.220]   The way to pull people, in my opinion, out of something like that is through education.
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:52.700]   We just took all of that away, which is pretty horrific in my opinion because you've taught
[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:54.420]   over 20 years.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:55.560]   You're perfectly right, Lex.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:15:01.580]   When you say that hate and violence won't work, it won't because you see dad get killed
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:02.580]   on the battlefields.
[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:06.340]   Well, that 14-year-old little boy is going to pick up an AK-47 and go avenge dad's death.
[02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:07.500]   That's just the way it's going to be.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.500]   Well, you think about it.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.340]   You were there for 20 years.
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:11.820]   There's a couple of generations in there.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:16.940]   There's another generation that's either grown up in this or has seen enough of this.
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:20.540]   They're always going to be a subset that think that we're the enemy.
[02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:24.420]   And fair, we haven't done always the greatest things.
[02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:28.820]   But the one thing that we have done that I did participate in was giving literacy, giving
[02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:33.820]   girls an opportunity, letting them know that you aren't second-class citizens.
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:35.700]   You can do things too.
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:40.660]   And that's why we have to look at war differently.
[02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:43.220]   There's times for violence.
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.980]   There's time for violence.
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:48.100]   And there's time for missiles.
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:50.980]   And there's time for detainees.
[02:15:50.980 --> 02:15:54.180]   And there's times for bag and tags and double taps to the fucking face.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.940]   There's times for all of that.
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:15:59.500]   But there needs to be more time to educate.
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:04.420]   The problem is you can't educate if you're in a country where their culture doesn't believe
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:05.420]   in that.
[02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:08.700]   You're fighting so many different things.
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:12.700]   It's an almost an impossible situation.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:17.300]   When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan and we just pulled out, there's a sudden pull
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:18.300]   out of troops.
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:21.780]   What do you think about those 20 years?
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:31.180]   Let me ask a hard question, which is, was it worth it going into Afghanistan?
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:33.500]   And you're sort of, you're one person.
[02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.140]   My limited capacity.
[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:41.500]   You have experienced specific set of extremely difficult things.
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:44.020]   You've met a lot of humans.
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:47.460]   You understand certain aspects of the way this war is carried out.
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:52.460]   But if you zoomed out at the big story, like you like history too.
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:59.380]   When you think of the history, a hundred years from now, we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.
[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:04.600]   I don't even think you need to go far that back to know that it was, we went in on false
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:06.320]   pretenses.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.320]   We did.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.460]   That's not a good start.
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:11.660]   What's that saying?
[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:18.340]   Future behavior is a good, was it past behavior is a good indicator of future behavior?
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:27.900]   So I struggle with that because when I first found out that the pull up was going to happen,
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:33.740]   I got really angry because my government skated the whole situation because he's having a
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:34.740]   snap.
[02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:35.740]   Canada's having a snap election.
[02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:38.220]   It's happening on the 20th.
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:46.900]   So that was beautifully planned by my government to hold no accountability, zero accountability.
[02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:49.140]   And the media won't talk about it.
[02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:51.300]   They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan.
[02:17:51.300 --> 02:17:54.820]   And then I told them what was going on after I talked to my people that were on the ground
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.860]   and then they canceled the interview.
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:18:00.780]   When you say my government is American, you better at this.
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:02.420]   Like it feels like there's no accountability.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:04.620]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:08.860]   The American government is a dumpster fire.
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:16.420]   I'm not saying I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is at least they sent people to
[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:20.300]   pull people or pull some people.
[02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:24.420]   We sent no one to pull anyone.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:28.420]   And I know for a fact, because I helped move a family, I was fortunate enough to be given
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:33.620]   an opportunity to help move a high value nine person family out of that country that worked
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:38.940]   in the government, that worked in prosecuting the Taliban, that were on the top of the list.
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:41.700]   I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things.
[02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:42.980]   And I'm really disgusted by it.
[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:48.700]   I learned that Canada had the one email address that all Canadian Afghani or visa holders
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:50.180]   were supposed to email.
[02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:54.020]   Ottawa put two people on that email address.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:56.140]   That's confirmed.
[02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:59.860]   Ottawa put no more than 70 people on the ground for that pullout and they were not allowed
[02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:02.380]   to leave the airport and they left well before the pullout date.
[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:04.300]   They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday.
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:07.340]   That was the 31st.
[02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:11.340]   There were high value Canadian visa holders that are still in that country that are on
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:12.860]   the top of the kill list.
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:17.020]   Canada's not doing anything about it.
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:21.740]   I'm disgusted in the way my government has acted because number one, there's an active
[02:19:21.740 --> 02:19:27.540]   lawsuit with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.
[02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:33.420]   We are leaving our vets and our Canadians stranded over there and we are leaving the
[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:38.020]   vets that have been maimed by this war in Canada.
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:39.020]   They're turned down for everything.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.300]   I've been turned down for hearing loss.
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:42.820]   They're saying it's not military related.
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:45.180]   They have PIs follow me.
[02:19:45.180 --> 02:19:47.500]   This is normal behavior.
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:52.860]   There's a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau in a meeting that after he lost
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:57.180]   his leg, he was just trying to get a new prosthetic because it was just killing him.
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:00.620]   Trudeau stood up in a meeting and said, "You're just asking for too much."
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:05.420]   Less than six months later, he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist that was in
[02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.540]   the Canadian prison system.
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:11.820]   He won and got $10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.
[02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:15.740]   So I don't know that American government's any better, but what I do know is that the
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:21.140]   absolute fucking machines of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command
[02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:25.260]   to pull my family out for me, I know they were there.
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:30.620]   The British that stayed on the ground that I contacted to literally confirm my biometric
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:33.740]   data and passports to get that family moved, they weren't there.
[02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:35.720]   That family would still be there.
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.560]   That three-year-old that got the shit kicked out of him by the Taliban that I was trying
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:44.140]   to exfil, Canada left him.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:50.620]   What is it about politicians and governments not willing to-
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:52.140]   Do their job?
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:21:03.300]   Well, not willing to do a big part of the job, which is you send people to war, these
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:12.900]   are heroes, and then you should spend most of the time repaying the debts to those.
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:15.780]   What is it about, why can't we-
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:20.140]   Because we're disposable numbers and we hire them out of high school when they're stupid
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:24.500]   enough to not understand what they're going to get themselves into.
[02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:27.980]   And then we blame it on themselves for making that decisions by volunteering.
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:32.100]   Yeah, but I mean, that still doesn't make sense to me.
[02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:33.100]   No, it's a cop-out.
[02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:40.220]   I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being that wants to do good for, I mean,
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:45.860]   I want to believe that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world.
[02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:54.420]   And I don't understand the system of delusion you have to live in to not understand who
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:55.420]   the heroes are.
[02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:58.620]   I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.
[02:21:58.620 --> 02:21:59.620]   You haven't met him though, have you?
[02:21:59.620 --> 02:22:05.340]   I don't actually, I'm speaking about Trudeau without knowing, but I mean, in general, think
[02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:06.620]   that way about leaders.
[02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:10.700]   I just think they surround themselves by people who delude them, who like-
[02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:12.420]   They're yes people.
[02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:18.820]   Yes people that lead them into a kind of reality that becomes detached from actual reality.
[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:21.940]   And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.
[02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:28.900]   They think maybe some kind of special interests, they focus on that versus like the humans.
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:34.500]   If you look back, was there a way we could have done something better in Afghanistan,
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:36.540]   assuming we do the invasion?
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:45.660]   So is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans, like investing more money in the
[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:53.940]   education of women and liberating people who are suffering injustice in those parts of
[02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:54.940]   the world?
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:56.060]   Like what's the better way to do it?
[02:22:56.060 --> 02:23:02.980]   And one other aspect is on the US side paid over $6 trillion for the wars in the Middle
[02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:03.980]   East since 9/11.
[02:23:03.980 --> 02:23:06.260]   So the financial side as well.
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:11.900]   Is there something you can comment on things we could have done better?
[02:23:11.900 --> 02:23:16.620]   That's a loaded question because you're talking to someone who had no hand in what happened
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:18.500]   other than do this and do that.
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:22.700]   So I can go from my perspective, which is there was probably plenty of things that we
[02:23:22.700 --> 02:23:24.900]   could have been doing better.
[02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:27.620]   I think there was a lack of leadership from the get-go.
[02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:34.580]   I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me was nowhere sufficient for
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:37.340]   a deployment of that level.
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:38.900]   Mind you, things happen.
[02:23:38.900 --> 02:23:43.820]   They didn't realize things would happen, but yet they happen.
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:50.460]   With little to absolutely no cultural idea was what I was walking into.
[02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:55.140]   Like when a male in the family grabbed the back of my vest because my hair was tucked
[02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:57.780]   and he thought it was a man going into a room with a bunch of women, I couldn't understand
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.300]   why he was attacking me.
[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:05.580]   There was no real breakdown of this is what you're going into, this is the culture, this
[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:10.580]   is why they do what they do, this is how they do it, this is how you should handle a situation
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:11.580]   like that.
[02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.220]   There was none of that.
[02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:17.140]   And something I speak about frequently and I think it's important to acknowledge is when
[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:20.860]   you're doing any of that training, we are giving none of our soldiers proper mental
[02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:22.820]   health training.
[02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:28.780]   Tools in that fucking toolbox or ways or things to look for on their buddy.
[02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:34.060]   Because we've created a system and a problem where if you say that you're ill or that you're
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.980]   struggling with PTSD, you're done.
[02:24:36.980 --> 02:24:38.180]   No one's going to say that.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:39.780]   They're going to keep struggling with it.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:40.780]   And that's when you get loose cannons.
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:42.580]   That's when you get problems happen.
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:47.140]   So you get fractures start to happen in leadership.
[02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:50.660]   And that's being seen and has been seen now for a while.
[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:59.820]   So in terms of what we could have done, say for a better way to go into the country, a
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:07.180]   better way to help the country, I can't speak to that as much as I wish I could.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:09.220]   Because I don't know that I would have all the answers.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.220]   What about withdrawal?
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:14.220]   Oh my God.
[02:25:14.220 --> 02:25:15.220]   That's a cover.
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:18.980]   Do you think more gradual?
[02:25:18.980 --> 02:25:24.260]   You think it's better to maintain presence there for indefinitely?
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:26.060]   I don't know about that.
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:29.180]   But I do know we have bases.
[02:25:29.180 --> 02:25:31.020]   We I say weeks I serve with them.
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:32.860]   Americans have bases in Japan.
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:34.580]   Americans have bases in Korea.
[02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:36.360]   Americans have bases in Germany.
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.420]   There's reasons there's bases everywhere.
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:40.420]   There's a smart there.
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:42.400]   There's an intellectual way to look at this.
[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.340]   You want to be able to have eyes and ears.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:49.180]   And have eyes and ears when you do things like you just did.
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:50.900]   The way that we pulled out of that country.
[02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:51.900]   That's right.
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:54.980]   The way that I hate saying American British because it puts like a blame on them.
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:57.260]   I say we because I'm a soldier.
[02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:58.940]   I'm a NATO soldier.
[02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:01.700]   The way we pulled out of that country.
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.900]   My five year old could have done it better.
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:07.820]   He could have said, Mommy, why are we not keeping that Bagram base?
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:12.580]   Mommy, why are we not keeping that base just until we get everyone else that we need?
[02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:16.300]   Why are we going to a civilian airport that we don't control, that we don't understand?
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:20.740]   Mommy, why are we doing this when there's only one road to it?
[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:24.660]   My five year old would have that conversation with me.
[02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:27.280]   It was so poorly done.
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:31.740]   It was so poorly executed and no fault of the soldiers on the ground on their own.
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:35.020]   My God, I can tell you there's operators.
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:38.460]   I just call them A. I don't say who he is because he's told me not to.
[02:26:38.460 --> 02:26:42.540]   There's a guy named A. And there's another guy named R. And there's a few other names.
[02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:51.460]   There's a guy named D. And these guys, they gave everything to try to pull my family when
[02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:54.580]   no one else would pull my family for me.
[02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:56.740]   They just got me on the phone and said, I don't know who the fuck you're talking to.
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:59.400]   I don't know how many people you're trying to get a hold of here, but you've got everyone
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:00.400]   looking for your family.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:02.580]   It's like I've gone to everyone I know.
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:04.060]   I've done stuff on Instagram.
[02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:05.060]   I've got a contact.
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:06.060]   The contact called me.
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:07.060]   I called them.
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:10.100]   I got, I was handling this family.
[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:13.900]   And when they call you and say, we can't go back to the gate, my three-year-old just got
[02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:15.800]   beat up by the Taliban.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:17.700]   And they say, what do we do now?
[02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:20.500]   I'm in Vancouver.
[02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:23.300]   Why am I being left to deal with this?
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:27.740]   Why is the civilian and ex-military population being left to deal with this?
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:29.580]   Why was this not thought out?
[02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:31.920]   We knew this was coming.
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:33.420]   We knew the time frame.
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:38.500]   Yeah, I ultimately blame, it almost starts at the top, always at the leadership.
[02:27:38.500 --> 02:27:41.940]   Sorry, this is the civilian leadership.
[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:46.460]   I think probably the generals know the right thing to do here.
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:51.460]   Even if they're sometimes overzealous in terms of being, wanting to increase, I think the
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:53.620]   great generals understand what's needed.
[02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:57.420]   And then it takes great leadership on the civilian side to listen to the generals and
[02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:01.020]   understand that war is not just about like-
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:02.380]   It's not binary.
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.380]   Yeah.
[02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:07.620]   And it's not about the invasion and saying mission accomplished.
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.780]   It's not about the PR.
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:12.500]   It's about the full complexity of geopolitics.
[02:28:12.500 --> 02:28:13.500]   Can I ask you this?
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:16.340]   You can ask me whatever you want.
[02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:18.620]   I'm looking at a book that you gave me, Do the Fucking Work.
[02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:19.620]   It's very motivating.
[02:28:19.620 --> 02:28:20.620]   Good Fucking Design Advice.
[02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:24.820]   That's their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:25.820]   That's great.
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:26.820]   I know, they're great.
[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:27.820]   What's the website?
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.820]   Good GFDA.
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:32.380]   Okay, so the F is for friendship.
[02:28:32.380 --> 02:28:33.380]   Something like that.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.420]   They are a design company.
[02:28:35.420 --> 02:28:37.620]   They've worked with Apple and Nike and this is their book.
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:39.420]   It's been published by HarperCollins.
[02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:44.900]   And it is really just, it's an incredible, they're an incredible company.
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:47.420]   They're artistically, like they're a design company.
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:49.580]   So you can see that.
[02:28:49.580 --> 02:28:50.740]   You can see it's a design company.
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:52.460]   Oh yeah, they signed it for you.
[02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:58.780]   And the pages are beautiful, but they have a saying and then a paragraph about each saying.
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:00.740]   Get fucking started.
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:02.620]   Obstacles are fucking opportunities.
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:05.300]   Fail, fail, and fucking fail again.
[02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.340]   Ask for fucking help.
[02:29:07.340 --> 02:29:10.020]   Show some fucking passion.
[02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:11.860]   Finish the fucking job.
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:12.860]   That's right.
[02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:13.860]   So we should send that to Biden.
[02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:15.380]   So I am...
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:16.660]   She said it, I didn't say it.
[02:29:16.660 --> 02:29:17.940]   Lex said it.
[02:29:17.940 --> 02:29:19.060]   I didn't say it.
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:20.060]   Lex said it.
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:21.060]   It's fine, I'll say it.
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:22.060]   I should also send it to Trudeau as well.
[02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:23.980]   So, but I mean, he probably wouldn't know how to read it.
[02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:25.940]   He just taught drama instead.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.980]   So I'll send it to the previous four presidents.
[02:29:28.980 --> 02:29:30.100]   How about that?
[02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:31.100]   That's fine.
[02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:33.660]   We can also send it to them too, because they're all just as much at fault.
[02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:38.740]   And they, most of them have all the same last names, but okay.
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:42.060]   Let me talk about them quickly, because we did a mug with them and I was really excited
[02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:43.060]   about it.
[02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:47.060]   Not because it was a mug, I'm a mug person, but I'm a mug obsessive.
[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:48.460]   I'm obsessive about my mugs.
[02:29:48.460 --> 02:29:50.260]   What's your favorite mug?
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:52.500]   Currently it's mine right now, the one that I have with them.
[02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:53.500]   Okay.
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:54.500]   The GMT mug.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.500]   What does it say on it?
[02:29:55.500 --> 02:29:57.620]   Do you want me to read what it says on it?
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:29:58.620]   Yeah, please.
[02:29:58.620 --> 02:29:59.620]   Okay.
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:04.620]   I was really excited about it because we created this with them, with GFDA.
[02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:09.740]   I found out about them because my husband's office, Atlas Neck Brace, he had his very
[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:14.300]   first office, he had one of their prints done and it was their original like, do the f-ing
[02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:15.860]   work.
[02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:20.980]   And I was really excited about them once I found out because I'm like, well, f- is my
[02:30:20.980 --> 02:30:28.140]   middle name and I want to make sure that I am going to-- whoever I work with, I want
[02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:32.500]   to make sure that I'm working with people that I believe in, that I believe what they
[02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:36.340]   stand for and I just think they're brilliant.
[02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:42.020]   So I got on the phone with them and I said, "Hi, I would like you to sponsor my podcast."
[02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:44.340]   And they said, "Cool, what's your podcast?"
[02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:49.540]   And I was like, "It's called Brass in Unity Podcast and I want to work with you guys somewhere."
[02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:52.300]   And they're like, "Okay, so like what are you thinking?"
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.900]   And I said, "You know, I'm looking to do-- I would love one day to do something with
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:57.900]   you.
[02:30:57.900 --> 02:31:00.420]   I don't know what it is, but I would like it to be something."
[02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:03.660]   And they said, "You know, we do like-- we have this book, but we also have like shirts
[02:31:03.660 --> 02:31:06.340]   and mugs with our sayings on them and prints."
[02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:11.140]   And so I was thinking to myself, I was like, "Well, if I just did like a mug with them,
[02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:15.260]   well then I could, you know, that could work for what my company does, which is it's a
[02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:19.500]   jewelry company and sunglass company, but it could be like an add-on kind of deal."
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:22.540]   These guys are really good designers, I can already tell.
[02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.380]   Yeah, I knew you would like this, that's why I brought it.
[02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:27.180]   So I'm like, "Certain people would appreciate this."
[02:31:27.180 --> 02:31:34.580]   And so my whole thing, my like hashtag is #WorkHardHelpHarder, and that's the whole
[02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:35.860]   concept of what I do now.
[02:31:35.860 --> 02:31:40.380]   And so we did a mug and it's called #FuckingHelpSomebody, that's their like first tag.
[02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:47.460]   And then the rest is, "Kindness is a wealth that increases as it is given away.
[02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:51.180]   What you get in return isn't passed between hands but felt between hearts.
[02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:55.500]   It's precisely because you've been at the bottom that you can raise others up.
[02:31:55.500 --> 02:32:00.260]   It's because you've," sorry, I'm reading a photo here, "You've been lost in the dark,
[02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:02.500]   you can lead others to the light.
[02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:07.900]   It's because you've fought with yourself that you can bring peace to someone else.
[02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:10.420]   You now have the strength because you've once struggled.
[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:16.940]   The best you have to come from is the fucking worst you've had to take."
[02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:20.660]   So this is the mug there, and we're sold out of them, we just got a bunch of-
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:22.300]   What does it say, "Fucking Help?"
[02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:23.740]   Fucking Help Somebody.
[02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:25.020]   Fucking Help Somebody.
[02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:29.900]   And so we did, they were so gracious enough to sit with me and be like, "What do you want
[02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:30.900]   the copy to be like?"
[02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:33.340]   And I said, "What do you think I want it to be?
[02:32:33.340 --> 02:32:35.060]   What would you, if you could write one for me, what would it be?"
[02:32:35.060 --> 02:32:37.340]   And they're like, "It's going to be around lifting people up."
[02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:39.060]   And I was like, "Okay, cool."
[02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:40.380]   And they're like, "Do you want 'fuck' in the title?"
[02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:43.460]   And I was like, "Every other word if we can have it."
[02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:44.660]   And they said, "We'll just do once."
[02:32:44.660 --> 02:32:46.540]   And I was like, "Okay, compromise."
[02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:49.940]   And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug and we're going to be doing a
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:50.940]   shirt with them.
[02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:58.860]   The whole thing to me was that embodied what I stand for now and the healing I've gotten
[02:32:58.860 --> 02:33:05.100]   to now and the point I've gotten to now in my life because that fucking sandpit almost
[02:33:05.100 --> 02:33:06.100]   broke me.
[02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:11.020]   Like, off the face of the earth broke me.
[02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:17.380]   First of all, can we go through the full journey of that in terms of your psychological development?
[02:33:17.380 --> 02:33:19.780]   Who were you before?
[02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:20.780]   Who were you after?
[02:33:20.780 --> 02:33:22.460]   Can you think about that?
[02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:23.460]   Like, what was your...
[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:29.580]   If you had to put a brain on the table before and after and try to analyze it.
[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:31.140]   Well, they both have CTE.
[02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:38.700]   So we know that they're both bruised and gray matter is a little dicey on them.
[02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:40.860]   And it may sound the same and it's not.
[02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:42.700]   So I'll try to explain it to you.
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:47.300]   Before that, don't you laugh because I know it's coming.
[02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:52.540]   I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.
[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:54.100]   I know it's hard to believe.
[02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:57.460]   This is you humble and quiet right now.
[02:33:57.460 --> 02:34:01.180]   This is normal me now.
[02:34:01.180 --> 02:34:03.020]   This is who I am now and I love that.
[02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:12.500]   But who I was before, I was, you know, motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.
[02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:14.900]   I didn't know how to dress.
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:18.020]   I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans and t-shirt all the time, that was like
[02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:20.380]   acceptable behavior as a woman.
[02:34:20.380 --> 02:34:21.940]   I wore skate shoes.
[02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:25.580]   I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear a skirt at.
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:26.580]   I wore pants.
[02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:27.820]   I played hacky sack.
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:30.340]   I was so into sports.
[02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.580]   I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.
[02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:34.380]   We heated our house that way.
[02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:37.260]   I would go in the transport.
[02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:42.020]   I stayed out of trouble for the most part.
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:43.260]   I think I was a fairly good kid.
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:46.740]   I was pretty angry though for most of my teenage life after my coach.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:49.660]   I lost my way a little bit there.
[02:34:49.660 --> 02:34:52.660]   I was just crazier.
[02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:54.420]   But happy?
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:55.500]   I don't know if I was happy.
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:56.940]   I'm realizing that now.
[02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:01.940]   I think I was, I think anger overtook who I was and I think that's why I was such an
[02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:04.620]   angry individual towards my parents when I was in high school.
[02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:08.860]   So parents, was it a little rough relationship with parents?
[02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:09.860]   I mean, yeah.
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:12.620]   I mean, my dad was gone a couple weeks at a time.
[02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:16.100]   So my mom, stay at home mom, had to handle me and my brother.
[02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:19.580]   We're both competitive athletes at the time by herself.
[02:35:19.580 --> 02:35:23.260]   And when you come home and you have a daughter that just calls you like a bitch to your face
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:29.140]   because she can't, she's being bullied so bad that she can't understand why, but also
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:34.980]   doesn't know how to fix it, but has no other outlet anymore to kind of get rid of it.
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:36.060]   I was not nice.
[02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.300]   I was a really mean person.
[02:35:37.300 --> 02:35:38.300]   I broke my mom.
[02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:40.260]   I remember the day she stopped yelling.
[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:41.260]   That's the day I know I broke her.
[02:35:41.260 --> 02:35:42.260]   I broke her.
[02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:46.220]   Did you have a source of discipline in your life?
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:51.300]   Maybe your dad, somebody who says you're being a bitch?
[02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:52.300]   Who would call me?
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:53.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:35:54.300]   Oh no, no, no, no.
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:55.300]   My parents were incredible.
[02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:59.580]   My dad came from a family of a bajillion kids who lived in a farm with no running water,
[02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:01.100]   with super...
[02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:03.680]   My dad was brash and abrupt.
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:05.560]   So I've caught myself doing that once in a while.
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:11.500]   So if I did one thing wrong, if he was just in a mood, I would know it.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.500]   So you weren't...
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:13.500]   Okay.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:15.820]   So that anger just took different forms?
[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:19.860]   It took different forms, but it mostly would be directed at my mom because I know she would
[02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:22.660]   take it and that was who I had.
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:25.740]   I feel bad about it to the day.
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:28.180]   She listened to the Jocko podcast and so did my dad.
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:31.700]   My mom promised me she would never read my book because there's certain parts.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:35.380]   My dad on my deployment, when I called him and told him some of the stuff, he started
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:36.380]   crying.
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:37.380]   My dad doesn't cry.
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:40.540]   He just said, "Please never tell your mother this.
[02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:41.660]   Don't do that to your mom."
[02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:44.540]   My mom, my grandfather came from Hungary.
[02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:49.420]   He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.
[02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:53.300]   He wasn't great as a dad.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:59.860]   My mom went through a lot as a kid and that was because her dad was in the war.
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:03.140]   That was because her dad didn't know any better.
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:06.500]   And she knew she couldn't be like that.
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:10.340]   So her way would be yelling.
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:13.140]   And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down.
[02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:14.140]   I broke her.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:20.140]   I shattered her ability to think that she could have any sort of relationship with me.
[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:23.900]   You wouldn't want to have had a relationship with me.
[02:37:23.900 --> 02:37:26.500]   The funny thing is you've rediscovered that now.
[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:29.380]   Are you guys close now?
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:30.380]   Yeah.
[02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:31.860]   She's so funny.
[02:37:31.860 --> 02:37:33.380]   She's coming out to help out again.
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:38.100]   She comes out to help out with Jack all the time.
[02:37:38.100 --> 02:37:39.980]   My dad, they're still truck drivers.
[02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:40.980]   They're still on the road.
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:41.980]   They team drive.
[02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:45.100]   They have their little dogs and they go and they do their thing.
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:47.740]   I've had that relationship now.
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:49.540]   It's still strenuous.
[02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:52.820]   When I'm having a hard time, she'll be the person I'll take it out on because I know
[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:55.280]   she can take it even though I know I shouldn't.
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:38:00.580]   It's like she's my safe space to be like blah about everything.
[02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:01.940]   And she'll just be like, "Well, that's not nice."
[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:02.940]   I'm like, "Well, you're not.
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:03.940]   Fuck it."
[02:38:03.940 --> 02:38:04.940]   And I'll take it out on her.
[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:07.940]   She knows I don't mean it and I try.
[02:38:07.940 --> 02:38:11.860]   But for whatever reason, she just takes it and-
[02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:14.380]   And it brings it out of you.
[02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:21.020]   Can you describe sort of the various characteristics, the shape of your PTSD, the trauma, how the
[02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:30.900]   anger and hate took shape in you in the seconds, minutes, hours, months, years after the full
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:34.700]   trauma of all the things you've experienced in Afghanistan?
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:38.060]   It's funny because Draco asked me something and it's made me – I've really been thinking
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:39.060]   a lot about it.
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:45.220]   And he's like, "Do you think if somebody of a leadership would have just sat you down
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:49.900]   and said, 'Hey, Burns, what you're feeling is okay.
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:51.660]   What you're feeling is normal.
[02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:56.740]   What you're feeling is what happens when you're in something like this.
[02:38:56.740 --> 02:38:58.140]   Do you think you would be where you are?'"
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:02.340]   And I said, "Well, I thought about it and I'm like, you know, I don't think I would
[02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:05.700]   be because I wouldn't have been medicated out of my mind.
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:10.620]   I wasn't able to process anything because I was just given medication right from the
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:11.620]   get."
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:16.340]   So for me, what happened was once that light switch was off, I was sent back to Kandahar
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:22.460]   to – Once the operation was over, we flew back to Kandahar like with the Brits.
[02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:26.900]   And then because there was deaths and we lost people on that operation, I had to go to the
[02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:33.140]   British side for the next, I think, three or four days and recant word for word what
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:36.340]   happened to a British MP who hand wrote statements.
[02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:38.980]   But we had to do that on repeat to make sure we all had the same story.
[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:42.500]   And so nobody shot anybody in the back.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:47.560]   And so that I don't think is a great way to do that after an after action.
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:52.060]   After action reports happen, but I don't think beating a dead horse and having somebody repeat,
[02:39:52.060 --> 02:39:55.660]   repeat, repeat, and then just imprint more and more and more.
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:59.300]   I don't know that that is a great way of doing that.
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:05.220]   And especially from a perspective of what are they, liability almost like legal, that
[02:40:05.220 --> 02:40:10.140]   perspective as opposed to the full perspective.
[02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:18.340]   For people who don't know, one is the over medication that you had to undergo.
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:25.020]   And then the other is the social isolation in terms of – I mean, more than what Jaco,
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:32.540]   you just mentioned, you also kind of mentioned that just being with other soldiers you're
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:39.660]   close with, just sitting there in silence and just sitting in that shared understanding,
[02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:45.540]   even that in itself communicates like these feelings are normal.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:46.540]   Like you don't have to talk.
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:48.620]   You don't have to talk at all.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:51.780]   And you were robbed of that as well, essentially.
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:56.100]   Yeah, because I was borrowed, I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.
[02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.220]   It was like – there was like a – I don't know what they call us, but it's like when
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:01.660]   you take a person and you put them in another unit, there's a name for it.
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.200]   I don't remember what it was.
[02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:05.380]   You never see those people again.
[02:41:05.380 --> 02:41:10.420]   But because I was in Kandahar, the doctors gave me the medication because I think I was
[02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.020]   the one who said, "This isn't right.
[02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:13.020]   I don't feel right.
[02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:14.020]   This is wrong."
[02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:17.220]   Because when I got back that night, there was supposed to be somebody there to pick
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:20.300]   me up to take me to the other side of the base and no one showed.
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:26.660]   So I humped on my kit back to the Canada house and I remember getting in the shower.
[02:41:26.660 --> 02:41:29.860]   And the rule was quick fucking showers.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:32.660]   No water.
[02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:37.980]   I must have sat on that floor of that shower for half an hour, 45 minutes.
[02:41:37.980 --> 02:41:39.740]   I just held myself and cried.
[02:41:39.740 --> 02:41:41.460]   I didn't even know why I was crying.
[02:41:41.460 --> 02:41:44.220]   I just knew I needed to cry.
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.220]   I still this day.
[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:53.700]   And when they sent me back to the FOB, they sent me back with all this medication after
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:57.900]   spending that time with the Brits.
[02:41:57.900 --> 02:42:01.340]   And they put me back on the guns, medicated it on my fucking tree.
[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:02.740]   I almost shot someone.
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:07.060]   But they didn't tell my staff that I was on meds.
[02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:11.340]   So when the artillery gun was going off and I didn't run to the gun and I was still asleep
[02:42:11.340 --> 02:42:16.940]   inside the tent with the gun beside my head, they didn't know I was just drugged.
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:20.180]   They just thought I was fucking off somewhere, hanging out with some Americans.
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:24.060]   They just thought I wasn't doing any of what I should be doing.
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:28.900]   And then I remember the moment my sergeant, we did a night shoot and he's so funny because
[02:42:28.900 --> 02:42:32.460]   he called me, goes, "Ah, fuck, Burns, I remember this.
[02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:36.700]   Yes, you were standing there with me and I look at you and go, 'Hey, Burns, are you
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:37.700]   OK?
[02:42:37.700 --> 02:42:42.380]   Because your eyes are all fucked.'"
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:46.820]   And I looked at Sergeant LeBlanc and I just remember going, "Yeah, I'm good."
[02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:51.100]   And he's like, "I still remember that."
[02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:52.100]   And I'm like, "I know."
[02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:54.340]   And he goes, "They never tell me anything.
[02:42:54.340 --> 02:42:57.140]   Fuck, Burns, I did not know the drugs you were on."
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:01.100]   And as I was on all of them, he goes, "I know I walk in, you show me the bottles.
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:05.340]   Ah, fuck, Burns, you should not have been there."
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.940]   I guarantee he sounds just like that.
[02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:07.940]   You'll find out.
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:08.940]   He's brilliant.
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:09.940]   He's brilliant.
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:18.820]   Yeah, so what, I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way of dealing with trauma.
[02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:21.580]   And it's for the military in some sense.
[02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:24.940]   If you don't have a good program in place, this makes sense.
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:26.500]   But you should have a good program in place.
[02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:30.020]   Just like you said, on the mental prep side.
[02:43:30.020 --> 02:43:32.060]   Just any prep.
[02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:38.140]   Like training people, training people on the, I suppose to, I guess, train the fact that
[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:42.140]   you're going to have somebody close to you blow up.
[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:45.020]   Like you have to probably visualize that.
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:46.020]   You have to think through that.
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:50.180]   You have to have a process of how to deal with something like that.
[02:43:50.180 --> 02:43:51.180]   With that kind of trauma.
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:52.180]   And then that's it.
[02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:54.180]   So what's in the toolbox of a doctor's colleague?
[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:55.180]   Exactly.
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:58.140]   I mean, and it's not like weakness, it's actually strength.
[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:04.060]   It's like, you have to be mentally strong enough to process that.
[02:44:04.060 --> 02:44:08.660]   That probably takes a lot of training, but it's a great training.
[02:44:08.660 --> 02:44:12.860]   It's well worth it to protect your investment training.
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:13.860]   Right.
[02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:16.780]   That's a very cold but correct way to put it.
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:17.780]   I mean, it's cold.
[02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:22.380]   I thought you would appreciate the coldness of the way I articulated that.
[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:23.380]   Well, yeah.
[02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:25.580]   I mean, I'm of two minds on this.
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:32.500]   I don't, I sometimes wonder what I would be like as a soldier, actually.
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:33.500]   I don't know.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:36.540]   Because I love country and I love all the things you're mentioning.
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:42.060]   Like I could see myself probably dying for my country and also enjoying the skill of
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:43.060]   it.
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:45.580]   The very like OCD.
[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:48.100]   Be very proficient.
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:49.100]   Yeah.
[02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:53.340]   But then also the human side, I fall in love with people.
[02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:54.540]   I fall in love with everything.
[02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:57.100]   So I don't know.
[02:44:57.100 --> 02:45:01.500]   I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain when you're executing a mission
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:09.940]   that cares about other humans outside your close knit group.
[02:45:09.940 --> 02:45:11.860]   There's no time for philosophical thinking.
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:12.860]   I don't know.
[02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:16.180]   I suppose that's why it's better to be young.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:17.180]   Young and dumb.
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:19.260]   You're not necessarily dumb.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:27.620]   It's just like you were over that energy of excitement of proficiency and excellence is
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:30.740]   just higher than it is later in life.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.660]   You're not dumb.
[02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:46.620]   I was not dumb, but I was naive, uneducated, not well trained and had an arrogance because
[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:50.020]   we were told we were the fucking shit.
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:51.020]   You're amazing.
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:52.780]   Okay, I'm amazing.
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:56.260]   So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training-
[02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:57.540]   That makes you weak.
[02:45:57.540 --> 02:46:00.380]   Do you think the military thinks that makes you weak?
[02:46:00.380 --> 02:46:01.380]   Yes.
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:05.820]   And the reason I can say that is because it's obvious in the way that they handle it now.
[02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:09.620]   So if a soldier says, "Hey, I'm really struggling with that last op we were on, man.
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:11.300]   It's just really, it's getting to me.
[02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:13.220]   I'm having a hard time sleeping."
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:19.780]   They're going to go, "Okay, well, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?"
[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:23.540]   And then you get that and you go, "Oh no, it's not that bad.
[02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:24.700]   I don't need anything for it.
[02:46:24.700 --> 02:46:26.340]   I'm just like once in a while I'm losing some sleep."
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.340]   They're like, "Okay."
[02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:31.460]   Because you know that pen moves, it's all getting written down and then you're degged
[02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:34.100]   red, which means you're not deploying again.
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:36.660]   And then you're not able to do the thing you love the most with the people you love the
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:37.660]   most.
[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:38.660]   Right.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:40.940]   But also, this is really difficult.
[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:43.580]   And I'd love to talk to you about PTSD.
[02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:44.580]   Okay.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:47.580]   Sorry, yes, I keep going off.
[02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:50.860]   No, please.
[02:46:50.860 --> 02:47:01.260]   So I'm hoping to launch a company in the engineering space.
[02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:05.140]   And I currently lead a few people.
[02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:11.020]   And it's always this kind of, like how much are you supposed to push people?
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:14.340]   Because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.
[02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:17.580]   Are you quoting our text messages from earlier?
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:18.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:19.580]   Exactly.
[02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:21.300]   All I have is just quotes from you.
[02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:22.300]   That's okay.
[02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:27.540]   Tells me how much we've spoken in the past week, poor soul.
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:31.580]   I don't know what to do because sometimes people are really struggling.
[02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:37.980]   Really struggling in a way, it's the Goggins thing.
[02:47:37.980 --> 02:47:43.020]   Where's the line to where you're actually breaking the human being versus where you're
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:48.700]   breaking them at the places where they will grow back stronger?
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:52.300]   And that line is tricky to truly understand.
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:59.420]   I think the military errors on the side of like, they push them beyond all limits.
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:00.780]   Physical limits.
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:03.900]   Physical, but mental, they need to respect the mental more.
[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:06.100]   They fuck with the brain a little bit.
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:09.660]   I mean, in basic training, they like scream in your face and to see who's going to crack.
[02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:13.980]   And they put you on sleep deprivation to see who's weak enough that they can't handle sleep
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:14.980]   depth.
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:16.300]   They do stuff to you.
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:20.380]   Like I know if you're a downed pilot, you have to go and you have to do this training
[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:22.300]   and you'll get captured.
[02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:26.300]   It's like this whole thing and they fuck with your brain.
[02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:27.900]   But there's a line.
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:29.660]   There's a line.
[02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:37.300]   My issue is go to the line, cross the line, give them the tools to come back from the
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:38.300]   line.
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:39.300]   Right.
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:40.300]   Yeah.
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:41.300]   We don't do that.
[02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:42.300]   We don't.
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:43.380]   We know there's PTSD.
[02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:44.940]   We know there's such a thing.
[02:48:44.940 --> 02:48:46.500]   We understand there's anxiety and depression.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:48.100]   We understand there's major depressive disorder.
[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:51.100]   We understand that there are precursors.
[02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:52.360]   There are signs and symptoms.
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:54.300]   We understand that.
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:49:00.820]   So why are we not building enough of a toolkit, whether that be, I'm not talking medication,
[02:49:00.820 --> 02:49:06.220]   I'm talking, it sounds woo woo, but fucking trust me, it works.
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:08.220]   I'm talking meditation.
[02:49:08.220 --> 02:49:09.780]   I'm talking yoga.
[02:49:09.780 --> 02:49:11.940]   I'm talking about peer group support.
[02:49:11.940 --> 02:49:16.780]   I'm talking about if you go to your doctor and report this, you're not automatically
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:18.940]   going to be losing your job.
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:22.320]   Why aren't we giving the proper tools and the education needed?
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:24.720]   These things are not difficult to teach.
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:25.720]   They don't take a lot of time.
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:27.540]   They don't take a lot of money.
[02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:30.420]   The only time it takes a lot of money is when you want to medicate.
[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:32.480]   We don't need to medicate you yet.
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:35.380]   You only need to be medicated if you're a danger to someone else or yourself.
[02:49:35.380 --> 02:49:39.420]   And most of the time, because of the way the system is set, you'll lie about it through
[02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:42.660]   your fucking teeth just so that no one touches you.
[02:49:42.660 --> 02:49:47.660]   - So from the perspective of the military, do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker
[02:49:47.660 --> 02:49:50.140]   and do all the mental work?
[02:49:50.140 --> 02:49:51.140]   - Yes.
[02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:55.780]   Some of the baddest dudes I've ever known are like, I gotta go to yoga.
[02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:57.780]   I gotta go meditate.
[02:49:57.780 --> 02:49:59.420]   I go do Aya with those guys.
[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:00.420]   Why?
[02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:04.980]   Because they know that that's not okay to be like that in your life.
[02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:10.140]   - Can you answer the ridiculously big question of what is PTSD?
[02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:13.820]   Do you understand the basic characteristics of it?
[02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:20.460]   Is there universal characteristics from your own unique experience, from what you've understood
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:21.460]   about it?
[02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:22.460]   - Yeah, of course there are.
[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:27.420]   So there's the basic things that a doctor looks for when they're diagnosing PTSD.
[02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:28.420]   I'm not a doctor.
[02:50:28.420 --> 02:50:30.060]   Let me make that fucking clear.
[02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:32.280]   But there are things that you look for.
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.020]   You look for insomnia.
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:36.060]   You look for anger and aggression.
[02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:38.220]   You look for people to fly off the handle.
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:40.660]   You look for avoidance.
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:42.800]   You can tell in somebody's body.
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.140]   People who can't sleep, if you can't sleep, you know that after a certain amount of time,
[02:50:47.140 --> 02:50:49.500]   they're just going to deteriorate.
[02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:52.340]   You know, sleeplessness triggers.
[02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:54.380]   - When you say avoidance, do you mean-
[02:50:54.380 --> 02:50:55.380]   - Avoidance.
[02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:58.960]   So like when I first got back to Canada, I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:00.760]   at all costs.
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:04.400]   No matter how much of a difference it made in my day, if I had to not go somewhere for
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:07.640]   one of the greatest events of my life, I wouldn't have went.
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:11.500]   - But isn't there some aspect there combined with the triggers?
[02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:16.040]   Maybe it's wise to avoid triggers even for your own personal health, well-being.
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:17.040]   - Well, that's it.
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:19.020]   For me, that was one of my triggers.
[02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:20.680]   So you have triggers.
[02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:24.480]   And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:25.480]   You can tell.
[02:51:25.480 --> 02:51:26.640]   You can tell when someone's triggered.
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:28.120]   A lot of vets don't like fireworks.
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:31.640]   It's like, "Okay, well, remove yourself from the situation."
[02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:39.640]   So there's other things within PTSD that kind of rear its head that with PTSD kind of attach
[02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:40.640]   other things.
[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:43.560]   So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD, I think it was like four years later, I was
[02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:46.200]   diagnosed with major depressive disorder.
[02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:50.800]   And that was kind of a compilation of things that was just like a shit show there.
[02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:52.160]   - What is major depressive disorder?
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:53.160]   - Good question.
[02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:56.080]   - Is there an answer?
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:57.080]   - I don't have one.
[02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:58.880]   I was told I had it.
[02:51:58.880 --> 02:51:59.880]   - Okay.
[02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:05.200]   So I mean, what does your mind go through?
[02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:06.280]   Where are the places-
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:08.080]   - That my mind goes?
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:09.080]   - Your mind goes.
[02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:12.960]   - Like the dark places when I get triggered and when it was like really bad?
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:13.960]   - Yeah.
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:14.960]   - Okay.
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:15.960]   - Yeah.
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:17.720]   So you thought about suicide.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:20.180]   - Every minute of every day.
[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:23.560]   - What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?
[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:28.840]   - At that time, the pros were no one has to deal with this anymore.
[02:52:28.840 --> 02:52:31.120]   I don't have to feel this way anymore.
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:33.120]   I'm a burden to my family.
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:35.840]   I'm a burden to the military system.
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:36.840]   I'm weak.
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:39.120]   I'm a bad soldier.
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:40.960]   I didn't do my job.
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:42.320]   I don't deserve to be alive.
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:45.180]   I don't deserve Veterans Affairs support.
[02:52:45.180 --> 02:52:49.340]   I don't deserve my, my parents don't deserve to watch me go through this.
[02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:54.160]   The guy I was dating didn't deserve to put up with the bullshit I put him through.
[02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:59.680]   The people who drive with me in cars didn't deserve to almost hit medians because I swerved
[02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:03.020]   because of a piece of garbage.
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:05.220]   People didn't deserve my racist outbursts.
[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:10.320]   People didn't deserve, people didn't, I did not deserve to be breathing anymore.
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:15.100]   I should have died there and I wished I died there.
[02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:17.220]   - So self-hate there too.
[02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:19.220]   - Oh, just a moniker.
[02:53:19.220 --> 02:53:23.420]   - Not even a big deal though, right?
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.780]   - That's at the core of it.
[02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:27.460]   That's like this.
[02:53:27.460 --> 02:53:30.380]   So how do you escape from that place?
[02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:35.900]   How do you overcome that, those, that depression essentially at the core of the desire to kill
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:37.500]   yourself?
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:44.900]   What basic principles, I mean, we could talk about ayahuasca, but basic principles of like
[02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:48.420]   literally like how do you escape that moment?
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:52.180]   Yeah, previous to any of that I did from 2009.
[02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:58.420]   I got out, so I was medically, I was 3B medical honorable discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011.
[02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:00.100]   So I left the military then.
[02:54:00.100 --> 02:54:02.740]   And so it's been 10 years, just over 10 years.
[02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:04.500]   Oh my God, it's 10 and a half years.
[02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:06.060]   I just realized that right now.
[02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:07.060]   Oh my God.
[02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:08.060]   - Happy anniversary.
[02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:09.060]   - Thanks, man.
[02:54:09.060 --> 02:54:10.060]   Awesome.
[02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:14.980]   So I've been out for 10 years and I would say the reason I didn't kill myself for the
[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:18.180]   longest time was the individual I was dating.
[02:54:18.180 --> 02:54:22.260]   That was straight across the board, that was it.
[02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:31.340]   For me, there was no relief for about six years of the thought of just kill yourself,
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:32.340]   kill yourself, kill yourself.
[02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:33.340]   It's easier if you just do it.
[02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:36.780]   Like that voice was so strong for that long, there was really no relief.
[02:54:36.780 --> 02:54:44.180]   What there was though was implementation of different medications, realizing they weren't
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:49.540]   working, trying different things, getting myself to a point where I could leave my house
[02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:54.980]   comfortably ish again and I wasn't triggered, which then allowed me to travel, which then
[02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:59.900]   allowed me to slowly try to go back to school, which by the way, it was a very bad idea.
[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:01.300]   That was a bad idea.
[02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:02.300]   That was bad.
[02:55:02.300 --> 02:55:05.100]   I went too early.
[02:55:05.100 --> 02:55:08.180]   They started practicing active shooter drills in our school.
[02:55:08.180 --> 02:55:09.580]   It was bad.
[02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:11.660]   My professors understood.
[02:55:11.660 --> 02:55:14.140]   - School is full of triggers, it turns out.
[02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:16.980]   - It is when you live in Vancouver.
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:20.900]   - There's a theme to this conversation about your love for Canada.
[02:55:20.900 --> 02:55:21.900]   - Look at me.
[02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:24.140]   I love my fucking country.
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:26.740]   I am one of the most patriotic people you will meet in it.
[02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:31.740]   I think Canada is one of the greatest fucking places on the earth.
[02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:38.860]   I think in the past two years or three years, I have seen what I loved so deeply, so proudly
[02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:50.380]   preached about so...
[02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:55.020]   I'm so proud of what I did there.
[02:55:55.020 --> 02:56:04.260]   And I'm so proud of the country I got to represent because I was good at my job.
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:08.900]   - Being great at your job for a country you love, you just don't like some of the politicians
[02:56:08.900 --> 02:56:09.900]   some of the time.
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:12.060]   - It's not even the politicians anymore.
[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:14.620]   It's the state of the country.
[02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:17.740]   I'm a second class citizen in my own country right now.
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:21.220]   I can't travel to see my parents within my own country.
[02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:24.720]   I'm not allowed to step foot in my son's school.
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.100]   I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.
[02:56:29.100 --> 02:56:34.460]   I'm not allowed to leave Canada without, I told you all the stuff I have to do to get
[02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:35.460]   here.
[02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:38.300]   To even get home, I have to do the same.
[02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:43.020]   I'm watched by the RCMP.
[02:56:43.020 --> 02:56:44.900]   Neighbors rat you out.
[02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:47.300]   - So for somebody who fought for their country.
[02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:48.300]   - I hate it.
[02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:49.300]   It makes me so sad.
[02:56:49.300 --> 02:56:55.860]   - To be, to go through this process of what many consider to be power overreach by government
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:57:00.700]   in the face of this particular pandemic.
[02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:03.580]   - I always knew I had a hard time with, I loved Canada.
[02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:06.140]   The day I got spit on when I got home was not ideal.
[02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:11.180]   - You got spit on.
[02:57:11.180 --> 02:57:17.280]   - But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I just put one foot in front of the other
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:23.580]   and kept going to treatment and kept doing what my doctor told me to do, that I could
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:26.980]   pull out of this if I tried.
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:29.820]   I was told that I could do anything in my life.
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:31.460]   It didn't matter.
[02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:32.460]   As long as I tried.
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:36.100]   - Was trying really hard?
[02:57:36.100 --> 02:57:41.700]   - Trying was harder than breathing.
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:42.980]   It was exhausting.
[02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:50.780]   It was, I would be awake for like half a day and every minute of that day, I'd just stare
[02:57:50.780 --> 02:57:53.900]   at the wall and just want to kill myself.
[02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:58.060]   - That's what I've had people close to me who suffer from depression.
[02:57:58.060 --> 02:58:06.260]   It was like, it's unclear how to escape, but it's clear that you need to try something.
[02:58:06.260 --> 02:58:07.940]   They didn't want to even try.
[02:58:07.940 --> 02:58:10.940]   - Because you have no try in you.
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:16.140]   - I'm watching a person who has no energy essentially to do any of it.
[02:58:16.140 --> 02:58:19.660]   It's so hopeless, but you have to try.
[02:58:19.660 --> 02:58:24.420]   I think some of that has to do with all the different physical feats you had to do.
[02:58:24.420 --> 02:58:27.420]   When you have nothing left, you still keep going.
[02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:33.580]   That same weird drive when you're empty, you still keep going.
[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:34.580]   - I wanted to give up.
[02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:36.740]   I tried.
[02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:37.740]   I did.
[02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:44.220]   I'm really lucky because it really was the one person that I'd wake up to every day and
[02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:47.980]   he'd be like, "Hey, so that new drug you're on, fun fact.
[02:58:47.980 --> 02:58:49.860]   If you don't go to sleep right away, you talk.
[02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:52.900]   When you talk, you just don't fucking stop.
[02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:55.620]   You go off about everything that's horrible."
[02:58:55.620 --> 02:58:57.420]   I'm like, "What are you talking about?
[02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:59.220]   No, last night, yeah, you took that pill.
[02:58:59.220 --> 02:59:00.220]   Guess what?
[02:59:00.220 --> 02:59:01.220]   You just didn't stop."
[02:59:01.220 --> 02:59:02.780]   I'm like, "I have no recollection."
[02:59:02.780 --> 02:59:04.540]   I'd get up in the middle of the night.
[02:59:04.540 --> 02:59:11.620]   I would cook food on a stove and it would be, "Hopefully we don't die," because I would
[02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:14.820]   have no recollection because of the drugs.
[02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:20.340]   The idea that when people say, "Well, just pull yourself out of depression."
[02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:25.880]   I'm a highly motivated individual.
[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:32.660]   The idea of lifting my head up to turnover was daunting.
[02:59:32.660 --> 02:59:33.660]   - It's terrifying.
[02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:39.860]   It's like for somebody as driven as you to completely lose all of that for moments of
[02:59:39.860 --> 02:59:42.380]   time, for stretches of time.
[02:59:42.380 --> 02:59:43.620]   Fuck.
[02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:45.740]   My mind is a motherfucker.
[02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:46.740]   - It is.
[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:49.140]   - I can't.
[02:59:49.140 --> 02:59:52.780]   For somebody like, I can't.
[02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:56.540]   I'm so grateful for people like you to be able to pull out of that.
[02:59:56.540 --> 03:00:00.340]   I've been always the opposite.
[03:00:00.340 --> 03:00:07.140]   I've been very fortunate to just always find joy and meaning in everything, even the stupidest
[03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:08.140]   shit.
[03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:09.140]   - Can I ask you something?
[03:00:09.140 --> 03:00:10.140]   - Yeah.
[03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:13.900]   - Was that just because of how you were raised, where you came from?
[03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:16.900]   Had nothing to do with that?
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:17.900]   - No.
[03:00:17.900 --> 03:00:19.340]   It was my own person.
[03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:27.660]   I honestly think it's the biology, this, because I had my parents, I'm very cognizant, have
[03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:30.700]   had nothing to do with that.
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:33.860]   They never understood this little engine I had.
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:37.980]   I always like just sitting, looking at people and just enjoying how amazing they are and
[03:00:37.980 --> 03:00:43.420]   just looking at, I think it's straight up just biology, whatever the neurochemistry
[03:00:43.420 --> 03:00:44.420]   is.
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:46.220]   I'm just getting a good drug.
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:47.780]   - You're just getting hits.
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:50.780]   - Yeah, I'm getting hits all the time from stupid shit.
[03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:51.780]   - I love that.
[03:00:51.780 --> 03:00:58.580]   - And it doesn't, and yeah, so that's why I can be, sometimes I'll talk very self-critically
[03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:03.660]   about myself, because that's almost makes me, it makes life more fun, it challenges
[03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:06.860]   stuff, it makes you more productive, but ultimately it's because I'm getting that.
[03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:07.860]   - You're getting the hits.
[03:01:07.860 --> 03:01:09.700]   - Yeah, I'm getting the good stuff all the time.
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:11.140]   - I wondered about that.
[03:01:11.140 --> 03:01:14.300]   I was thinking about that when I listened to you for the first time on, I think when
[03:01:14.300 --> 03:01:17.300]   you were on Rogan for the first time, water shouldn't do that.
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:19.180]   - Oh, it's not water.
[03:01:19.180 --> 03:01:20.180]   You shouldn't trust.
[03:01:20.180 --> 03:01:21.180]   See, this is the thing with the Russians.
[03:01:21.180 --> 03:01:22.180]   - It's Dasani, it's done by Coca-Cola.
[03:01:22.180 --> 03:01:26.140]   - Well, no, I had it resealed.
[03:01:26.140 --> 03:01:30.980]   - I mean, I didn't go that far, but now I'm really starting to question what's in this,
[03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:31.980]   but that's okay.
[03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:35.140]   - If I offered you tea, you should really be worried, but yeah.
[03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:36.140]   - Why?
[03:01:36.140 --> 03:01:37.140]   - I mean, that's a--
[03:01:37.140 --> 03:01:38.140]   - You don't drink tea?
[03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:43.220]   - No, that's the more famous way that Russians usually assassinate, they put poison in the
[03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:46.580]   tea, because a lot of Russians drink tea and, you know.
[03:01:46.580 --> 03:01:50.380]   - All right, well, I mean, there is a blade right there, so.
[03:01:50.380 --> 03:01:54.580]   - I thought it was somebody, Andrew Heuermann gave that to me.
[03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:57.020]   He's also a good, I don't know if you know him, but he's a cool--
[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:59.380]   - I don't know all the people you know, I'm new.
[03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:00.380]   I'm new here, Lex.
[03:02:00.380 --> 03:02:01.380]   You're gonna have to--
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:02.380]   - I'll send instructions.
[03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:04.420]   - Yeah, you're gonna have to send, what does my friend say?
[03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:08.100]   He says he's an ex-operator and he'll message me once in a while and ask me something and
[03:02:08.100 --> 03:02:09.100]   I'll answer back.
[03:02:09.100 --> 03:02:14.260]   If I answer in the correct way, he'll go, "Candidate meets expectations."
[03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:16.820]   I'm like, "Fuck you, I'm not a candidate of anything."
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:17.820]   - Yeah.
[03:02:17.820 --> 03:02:19.260]   - Yeah, but yeah, it's essentially it.
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:21.620]   - Well, Andrew Heuermann is kind of a celebrity.
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:24.340]   Andrew, you should check her out.
[03:02:24.340 --> 03:02:25.940]   You're an interesting person, you guys should connect.
[03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:32.780]   He's a Stanford neuroscientist, was I think the number one podcast in the world in health.
[03:02:32.780 --> 03:02:33.780]   He's a--
[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:34.780]   - Does he have on the beard?
[03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:37.260]   Does he have a beard thing going?
[03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:39.260]   - Yeah, I don't look at--
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:41.180]   - I'm knocking him down too.
[03:02:41.180 --> 03:02:43.060]   Does he have a beard?
[03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:45.180]   - I don't look at people's visual appearance, man.
[03:02:45.180 --> 03:02:46.180]   - You're full of shit.
[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.180]   - No, I don't.
[03:02:47.180 --> 03:02:48.180]   Does he have a beard?
[03:02:48.180 --> 03:02:49.180]   I think he has a beard, yeah.
[03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:50.180]   - I think I know who you're talking about.
[03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:54.020]   - He's a very handsome gentleman.
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:56.540]   - I think I know who you're talking about 'cause I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.
[03:02:56.540 --> 03:02:57.540]   - Yeah, exactly.
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:58.540]   - No, seriously, on Instagram.
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:02:59.540]   No, no, no, okay.
[03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:00.540]   - You probably know him.
[03:03:00.540 --> 03:03:02.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't know him.
[03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:04.780]   - But he's very humble, very intelligent.
[03:03:04.780 --> 03:03:09.580]   Probably would understand, I'm very kind of poetic and so on.
[03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:16.820]   He's probably the most rigorous reference machine of science.
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:18.260]   He's a legit scientist.
[03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:22.340]   He knows every paper and everything has to do with the mind and neuroscience.
[03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:23.340]   - He would be fascinating.
[03:03:23.340 --> 03:03:24.340]   - Performance, yeah, yeah.
[03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:31.980]   He's much more, he's much more actually, and the focus is always on how to help.
[03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:36.500]   How that helps people, so like protocols.
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:38.500]   Here's what you need to do to get better sleep.
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:39.500]   - Yes, yes, I know who it is.
[03:03:39.500 --> 03:03:41.500]   - And he's like, here's like a thousand papers.
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:47.620]   And he just goes like, hammers nonstop.
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:48.820]   He spent a week in Austin.
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:52.460]   He's coming back and spending a couple weeks in Austin.
[03:03:52.460 --> 03:03:57.020]   We just hang out and it's like, you think that was like a teleprompter or something,
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:58.260]   the way he does his podcast.
[03:03:58.260 --> 03:03:59.260]   - He's just.
[03:03:59.260 --> 03:04:00.860]   - Yeah, but in person, he's the same.
[03:04:00.860 --> 03:04:05.180]   He's like, all right, this is intense, but I like it.
[03:04:05.180 --> 03:04:06.180]   - I like that.
[03:04:06.180 --> 03:04:08.820]   - Anyway, why did we bring him up?
[03:04:08.820 --> 03:04:09.820]   I don't know.
[03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:10.820]   - We brought up knives.
[03:04:10.820 --> 03:04:11.820]   We were talking about.
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:12.820]   - He gave it to me.
[03:04:12.820 --> 03:04:13.820]   That's right, PTSD.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:16.060]   - Yeah, and then you're talking about poison and how you were poisoning me.
[03:04:16.060 --> 03:04:18.460]   And I said knives, we were talking about Russians.
[03:04:18.460 --> 03:04:22.220]   And then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.
[03:04:22.220 --> 03:04:27.860]   I think for most people though, the biggest thing when they see somebody who's struggling
[03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:32.060]   with PTSD, their first reaction is how do I help them?
[03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:36.860]   Well, often just saying, hey, I'm here when you're ready to talk and you're going through
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:39.740]   something whether you want to talk about it right now or not, I'm here.
[03:04:39.740 --> 03:04:42.620]   And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.
[03:04:42.620 --> 03:04:50.380]   When you start to see somebody having four, five, six beers at night, let's ask why.
[03:04:50.380 --> 03:04:52.420]   When you see somebody, you can tell they're not sleeping.
[03:04:52.420 --> 03:04:53.420]   Hey, buddy, you sleeping?
[03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:55.900]   No, I'm just not sleeping.
[03:04:55.900 --> 03:04:57.980]   Instead of just going, oh, that sucks.
[03:04:57.980 --> 03:05:00.380]   Hey, why aren't you sleeping?
[03:05:00.380 --> 03:05:01.380]   You having nightmares?
[03:05:01.380 --> 03:05:03.900]   Are you just having insomnia?
[03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:06.900]   Are you just eating sugar before bed?
[03:05:06.900 --> 03:05:10.740]   Care enough about your people to just ask one follow-up question.
[03:05:10.740 --> 03:05:12.780]   Because often that's really all it takes.
[03:05:12.780 --> 03:05:15.180]   Because then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask.
[03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:17.100]   And then they'll just.
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:20.140]   - Yeah, just showing that you care.
[03:05:20.140 --> 03:05:22.580]   - Honestly, grocery store lineup.
[03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:24.500]   I'll say, oh, I like your dress.
[03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:25.500]   Oh, thank you.
[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:26.900]   And then I'll go, how's your day going?
[03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:30.380]   They're like, actually, it's going all right.
[03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:33.140]   It's not as great as I thought it would be today, but I'm doing okay.
[03:05:33.140 --> 03:05:36.940]   But they'll give you, instead of, good you, instead of just giving you this fake false
[03:05:36.940 --> 03:05:44.100]   reaction, if you just show any effort in somebody that you care at all about someone's well-being,
[03:05:44.100 --> 03:05:45.100]   you'd be amazed, amazed.
[03:05:45.100 --> 03:05:49.140]   - Yeah, and some of that is just energy.
[03:05:49.140 --> 03:05:54.420]   The reason, honestly, I moved to Austin is some lady at a Walmart said, honey, you look
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:57.260]   handsome in that suit.
[03:05:57.260 --> 03:06:00.420]   But the care that she put in that, she just looked at me.
[03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:02.460]   It wasn't hitting at me or something.
[03:06:02.460 --> 03:06:03.460]   She was like, the love.
[03:06:03.460 --> 03:06:04.460]   - Just love.
[03:06:04.460 --> 03:06:07.620]   - Yeah, and I was like, oh, okay, I'm moving here, I guess.
[03:06:07.620 --> 03:06:12.300]   - That's so funny you said that, because I told my husband this happened, and it threw
[03:06:12.300 --> 03:06:13.300]   me off.
[03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:18.900]   There was an older lady at a store, and this was right after we got a brief period of no
[03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:20.500]   masks in Canada.
[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:21.500]   Just like a brief.
[03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:22.500]   - It was like five minutes.
[03:06:22.500 --> 03:06:23.940]   - Oh, yeah, it was not even that.
[03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:28.660]   And I had come from an interview or something, so I actually had makeup on that day, and
[03:06:28.660 --> 03:06:31.180]   I had my hat, and I was just at the grocery store.
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:34.260]   She walked up to me, and she got real close, and I didn't know what was happening.
[03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:37.860]   And she got closer, and then she just grabbed my arm like this.
[03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:40.600]   She goes, I love that hat on you.
[03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:43.860]   And I looked at her, and I was like, she touched me during a pandemic, and she's old.
[03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:45.180]   Oh, my God, I love you, too.
[03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:46.180]   Thank you so much.
[03:06:46.180 --> 03:06:47.660]   I said, you're so amazing.
[03:06:47.660 --> 03:06:49.100]   And I just sparked a conversation.
[03:06:49.100 --> 03:06:50.100]   - Yeah, that's amazing.
[03:06:50.100 --> 03:06:51.860]   - It doesn't take much.
[03:06:51.860 --> 03:06:55.340]   - Yeah, at that little moment of genuine care.
[03:06:55.340 --> 03:07:01.780]   Maybe you can tell me actually the journey you took with ayahuasca.
[03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:03.060]   That's such a fascinating journey.
[03:07:03.060 --> 03:07:09.700]   So letting your mind go to different places in order to rediscover itself.
[03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:13.500]   What is it, like a rocket ship to somewhere else so you can land in a better place?
[03:07:13.500 --> 03:07:18.180]   - Here, how about I show you something that'll help your brain, okay?
[03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:21.140]   This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera, 'cause there's leaves
[03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:22.860]   in it, like there's leaves in some pages.
[03:07:22.860 --> 03:07:25.940]   So just don't dump it out, 'cause it'll go all fucking everywhere.
[03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:26.940]   - Got it, got it.
[03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:27.940]   Instructions, I like this.
[03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:33.300]   - Yeah, well, you feel like you need them.
[03:07:33.300 --> 03:07:39.500]   Ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic that we have been so blessed to have on this earth
[03:07:39.500 --> 03:07:45.460]   that we have so underutilized and could be, I don't wanna say saving humanity, but just,
[03:07:45.460 --> 03:07:48.700]   you ever hear that saying, if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time, the world
[03:07:48.700 --> 03:07:50.140]   would be a better place?
[03:07:50.140 --> 03:07:57.620]   - Okay, so psilocybin is, I use for microdosing for depression.
[03:07:57.620 --> 03:08:04.780]   I did ayahuasca in January of this year, and I've, at that point, that was the last time
[03:08:04.780 --> 03:08:06.420]   I was on a pharmaceutical drug.
[03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:09.980]   I've been off everything ever since, 10 different ones.
[03:08:09.980 --> 03:08:15.620]   So if you backtrack a little bit, just so you'll understand, my doctor gave me the opportunity,
[03:08:15.620 --> 03:08:20.980]   Greg Passi, he is a veteran himself, served in Bosnia and Rwanda.
[03:08:20.980 --> 03:08:24.460]   He's a medic, he's a colonel, I think colonel lieutenant, he's gonna fucking punch me right
[03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:25.460]   in the face for that.
[03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:28.260]   He's high up officer.
[03:08:28.260 --> 03:08:29.260]   He's one of my saviors.
[03:08:29.260 --> 03:08:31.220]   He's like my old, I call him my old man.
[03:08:31.220 --> 03:08:35.340]   He's my favorite, and rides a Harley, like that kind of guy.
[03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:36.340]   - Nice.
[03:08:36.340 --> 03:08:41.300]   - Yeah, and he said, "You know, Kels, this is, I just don't, I was hitting a wall.
[03:08:41.300 --> 03:08:42.300]   I wasn't getting any better."
[03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:45.660]   And he goes, "How do you feel about cannabis?"
[03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:51.380]   And I was like, "I don't feel good about it because family histories or my parents always
[03:08:51.380 --> 03:08:54.060]   told me if I smoked weed, you know, it's just this perception."
[03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:56.660]   He goes, "I just want you to try it.
[03:08:56.660 --> 03:08:58.340]   Just, would you be willing to try it?"
[03:08:58.340 --> 03:08:59.340]   So I was like, "Okay."
[03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:01.580]   So I was willing to try it.
[03:09:01.580 --> 03:09:06.540]   Then I started going to these groups called Women Grow and learning about it, and then
[03:09:06.540 --> 03:09:12.620]   I realized, "Oh, I'm starting to sleep a little bit.
[03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:14.780]   I don't feel groggy in the morning.
[03:09:14.780 --> 03:09:18.460]   I don't feel like a bag of shit, and I also want to have a baby one day, and I can't have
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:21.060]   all this stuff in my system."
[03:09:21.060 --> 03:09:27.700]   So I started using cannabis, and then I started using it as a main medication, and I'd been
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:35.140]   using it now since 2014, got married, 15, 16, Jack was born in '16.
[03:09:35.140 --> 03:09:36.140]   15.
[03:09:36.140 --> 03:09:41.100]   2015, I started using it, and then I've been using it ever since.
[03:09:41.100 --> 03:09:46.500]   And that was the way I got off of all the pharmaceutical drugs, was keeping cannabis
[03:09:46.500 --> 03:09:51.740]   the constant, finding the right strains for me, and then slowly, with the doctor's advice
[03:09:51.740 --> 03:09:56.420]   and under supervision, going off of those medications.
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:09:59.580]   Cut to January of 2021.
[03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:04.700]   I had hit a really bad spell last year, and the year before was a really big struggle.
[03:10:04.700 --> 03:10:09.820]   I almost lost my company last year due to COVID, just like many, many millions of people
[03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:11.860]   did.
[03:10:11.860 --> 03:10:17.820]   And instead of me just laying down and taking it, I pivoted really quickly and called the
[03:10:17.820 --> 03:10:19.460]   factory and said, "Do you guys make masks?"
[03:10:19.460 --> 03:10:21.140]   They're like, "Yeah, we're making masks."
[03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:24.020]   I was like, "I'm going to call the Canadian government.
[03:10:24.020 --> 03:10:27.660]   I'm going to get my medical license, and I'm going to try to sell them masks and see if
[03:10:27.660 --> 03:10:28.660]   we can do that."
[03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:29.660]   And so we did that.
[03:10:29.660 --> 03:10:37.860]   We did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals, which ironically went to my entire community
[03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:38.860]   I was born and raised in.
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:44.620]   So it was really weird, and that kept us afloat long enough.
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:50.180]   We lost 200 retail locations that I all single-handedly spent five years going door-to-door getting
[03:10:50.180 --> 03:10:51.180]   myself.
[03:10:51.180 --> 03:10:54.340]   And we should say this is Brass & Unity Jewelry.
[03:10:54.340 --> 03:10:57.260]   Yeah, the jewelry and sunglass company.
[03:10:57.260 --> 03:10:58.260]   And I started-
[03:10:58.260 --> 03:10:59.260]   Speaking of which.
[03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:00.260]   Lexx looks like a serial killer.
[03:11:00.260 --> 03:11:01.260]   Lexx looks like a Brass & Unity sunglasses.
[03:11:01.260 --> 03:11:02.260]   I mean, you do look good in them.
[03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:03.260]   I won't lie to you.
[03:11:03.260 --> 03:11:04.260]   Thank you.
[03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:05.260]   Well, okay.
[03:11:05.260 --> 03:11:06.260]   We'll call them the Lexx.
[03:11:06.260 --> 03:11:07.260]   Those are now called the Lexx.
[03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:08.260]   Fuck the Gunner.
[03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:09.260]   They're the Lexx.
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:10.260]   I like it.
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:11.260]   The Lexx.
[03:11:11.260 --> 03:11:14.620]   I'm jumping around here, but just bear with me.
[03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:16.100]   My doctor suggested art therapy.
[03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:17.220]   Dr. Pasi did.
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:19.140]   And that's really how the company started.
[03:11:19.140 --> 03:11:23.260]   I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill, and I fucked up our kitchen table,
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:24.940]   and I taught myself how to build jewelry.
[03:11:24.940 --> 03:11:26.860]   Because my husband was like, "You can do it.
[03:11:26.860 --> 03:11:27.860]   Go for it."
[03:11:27.860 --> 03:11:30.980]   I was like, "Okay, he says he believes in me, so I guess I can do it.
[03:11:30.980 --> 03:11:32.940]   No idea what I'm doing."
[03:11:32.940 --> 03:11:38.860]   And then got to this point where COVID hit and people lost companies, and we pivoted
[03:11:38.860 --> 03:11:40.860]   and we did what we could.
[03:11:40.860 --> 03:11:45.380]   And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.
[03:11:45.380 --> 03:11:48.980]   I found purpose again with this company.
[03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:51.220]   I found a way to help again.
[03:11:51.220 --> 03:11:54.660]   I found myself again.
[03:11:54.660 --> 03:11:58.540]   And then that was in danger of being gone again.
[03:11:58.540 --> 03:12:01.660]   So the company is 2015?
[03:12:01.660 --> 03:12:05.380]   I started building jewelry in 2015 under like a...
[03:12:05.380 --> 03:12:09.060]   It was called Her Wearables, and it was really small.
[03:12:09.060 --> 03:12:11.460]   I was just trying to make stuff.
[03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:13.220]   It wasn't supposed to be a company.
[03:12:13.220 --> 03:12:15.380]   And you were on a ton of medication throughout this whole process.
[03:12:15.380 --> 03:12:17.900]   Just nuked out of my tree.
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:23.500]   And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is, she was driving her Kevin Hart's What
[03:12:23.500 --> 03:12:25.100]   Now Tour.
[03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:29.380]   And so she just harassed them, was like, "You need to meet my daughter."
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:30.380]   So he finally met with me.
[03:12:30.380 --> 03:12:31.980]   I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart.
[03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:32.980]   That's cool.
[03:12:32.980 --> 03:12:33.980]   But he just gave me a good piece of advice.
[03:12:33.980 --> 03:12:37.460]   "Hey, if you're going to make this something, if you want it to be for everyone, you can't
[03:12:37.460 --> 03:12:38.460]   call it Her Wearables."
[03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:39.860]   I was like, "Cool."
[03:12:39.860 --> 03:12:44.180]   And then we drove home that night, and then he tweeted it out to people, to 24 million
[03:12:44.180 --> 03:12:45.180]   people.
[03:12:45.180 --> 03:12:47.940]   This was before he was like, "Who is now?"
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:49.580]   And that was a giant deal.
[03:12:49.580 --> 03:12:52.420]   And then my husband kind of looked at me and being, "He's so fucking brilliant."
[03:12:52.420 --> 03:12:55.020]   He looked at me and goes, "All right, yeah, we got to come up with a rename.
[03:12:55.020 --> 03:12:56.020]   Let me start thinking.
[03:12:56.020 --> 03:12:57.020]   Let me start brainstorming.
[03:12:57.020 --> 03:12:58.340]   You want to make this real?
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:12:59.660]   Let's make this real."
[03:12:59.660 --> 03:13:01.200]   And so we did.
[03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:04.860]   And he was like, "What do you think about we were doing Brass Collective Co, Brass this,
[03:13:04.860 --> 03:13:07.420]   brrrah, I just knew I wanted Brass in the name."
[03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:08.580]   And then he's like, "What about Brass and Unity?
[03:13:08.580 --> 03:13:10.060]   You're trying to unify people.
[03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:11.060]   Why wouldn't you do that?"
[03:13:11.060 --> 03:13:12.060]   I'm like, "Fuck me."
[03:13:12.060 --> 03:13:14.060]   Of course he came up with it like everything else.
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:15.060]   Yeah, it's a great name.
[03:13:15.060 --> 03:13:16.380]   Well, he's a brilliant person.
[03:13:16.380 --> 03:13:17.740]   It's annoying.
[03:13:17.740 --> 03:13:22.260]   So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built and just got me kind of functioning
[03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:24.860]   with was devastating.
[03:13:24.860 --> 03:13:29.940]   So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff, Combat Flip Flops.
[03:13:29.940 --> 03:13:34.420]   Again, Brady, my husband was like, "Hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.
[03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:37.020]   Hey, have you heard of this company Combat Flip Flops?
[03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:38.920]   Remember we watched them on Shark Tank."
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:39.920]   And then I reached out.
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:40.920]   He emailed me back.
[03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:43.860]   He's like, "Yeah, we go together like peanut butter and jelly are companies.
[03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:45.500]   That sounds great."
[03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:50.020]   And then I was like, "Hey, also, do you think one of your owners would want to come on the
[03:13:50.020 --> 03:13:54.340]   podcast just like tossing it out there kind of like I did with you?"
[03:13:54.340 --> 03:13:56.460]   And he was like, "Yeah, I'd love to come on."
[03:13:56.460 --> 03:13:59.100]   And I was like, "Oh my God, Brady."
[03:13:59.100 --> 03:14:01.180]   And he came on the podcast and it went great.
[03:14:01.180 --> 03:14:04.660]   And then at the end of it, we stopped recording and he just kind of did this thing.
[03:14:04.660 --> 03:14:05.660]   He does this.
[03:14:05.660 --> 03:14:10.660]   He just like leans in real close, looks into your soul and goes, "How are you doing?"
[03:14:10.660 --> 03:14:11.660]   And they're like, "Great."
[03:14:11.660 --> 03:14:12.660]   And he's like, "How are you really doing?"
[03:14:12.660 --> 03:14:13.660]   I'm like, "I'm horrible.
[03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:14.660]   I hate everything.
[03:14:14.660 --> 03:14:20.140]   I'm horrible.
[03:14:20.140 --> 03:14:21.140]   I hate everything."
[03:14:21.140 --> 03:14:22.140]   Just this whole like waterworks happened.
[03:14:22.140 --> 03:14:24.220]   And he goes, "Listen, have you ever heard of Ayahuasca?"
[03:14:24.220 --> 03:14:28.860]   And I was like, "Yeah, like in movies and like psychedelics in the 70s."
[03:14:28.860 --> 03:14:30.540]   And he's like, "No, no, no, no.
[03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:31.540]   Let's like have a talk."
[03:14:31.540 --> 03:14:34.060]   And he goes, "I've got an opportunity for a spot.
[03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:37.180]   I'm going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.
[03:14:37.180 --> 03:14:41.740]   They have spaces in UK, Canada, and the United States.
[03:14:41.740 --> 03:14:45.700]   They're owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:47.900]   They're really trying to help vets.
[03:14:47.900 --> 03:14:48.900]   And this has worked.
[03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:49.900]   Would you want to come?"
[03:14:49.900 --> 03:14:51.780]   And before he even said like, "Would you?"
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:54.380]   Before I even got like an invite, I was like, "Can I come?
[03:14:54.380 --> 03:14:57.900]   When can I-- When do we go?"
[03:14:57.900 --> 03:14:59.940]   And he's like, "Oh, it's in like three weeks.
[03:14:59.940 --> 03:15:02.460]   You can't be on any SSRIs.
[03:15:02.460 --> 03:15:04.020]   If you're on any, you're going to have to wean off."
[03:15:04.020 --> 03:15:06.620]   And at the time, I was on my last one.
[03:15:06.620 --> 03:15:10.340]   And so I was like, I called my doctor and I was like, "Listen."
[03:15:10.340 --> 03:15:11.700]   And he was like, "What?"
[03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:13.660]   And I was like, "Guess what I'm about to do."
[03:15:13.660 --> 03:15:16.380]   And he's like, "I'm gonna go do Ayahuasca."
[03:15:16.380 --> 03:15:17.740]   And he goes, "You're gonna--"
[03:15:17.740 --> 03:15:22.740]   He does this thing where he just goes, "All right."
[03:15:22.740 --> 03:15:25.060]   'Cause he knows he's not gonna win.
[03:15:25.060 --> 03:15:25.900]   He knows I'll just fight him on it.
[03:15:25.900 --> 03:15:29.060]   - Let's just call that like the Jocko reset.
[03:15:29.060 --> 03:15:30.780]   - Yeah. - Because he does a--
[03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:33.020]   - Pretty much, yeah, exactly.
[03:15:33.020 --> 03:15:35.300]   And he goes, I said, "But here's the kicker.
[03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:37.420]   I have to go off of this medication."
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:39.180]   And he goes, "Well, you know we're supposed to do that
[03:15:39.180 --> 03:15:41.020]   in the summer months when the depression's not--
[03:15:41.020 --> 03:15:41.860]   You know, blah, blah, blah."
[03:15:41.860 --> 03:15:44.980]   I said, "Listen, I hear you, but I'm doing it
[03:15:44.980 --> 03:15:47.060]   whether you want me to or not.
[03:15:47.060 --> 03:15:49.980]   So I'm letting you know, hey, this is gonna happen."
[03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:52.060]   And he's like, "Okay, just try to do it properly."
[03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:53.260]   I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the drill.
[03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:54.340]   I know the drill, whatever, whatever.
[03:15:54.340 --> 03:15:55.260]   I went to school to be a paramedic.
[03:15:55.260 --> 03:15:57.620]   I know the drill, I'll go off of it properly."
[03:15:57.620 --> 03:15:58.980]   But again, like drop that.
[03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:02.100]   Within a week, that stuff was, I was done taking it.
[03:16:02.100 --> 03:16:05.020]   And I was going through like the world's worst
[03:16:05.020 --> 03:16:06.300]   just withdrawals.
[03:16:06.300 --> 03:16:09.220]   It was like you were at a rock concert
[03:16:09.220 --> 03:16:10.780]   and your head was banging up and down,
[03:16:10.780 --> 03:16:13.180]   but you were sitting perfectly still.
[03:16:13.180 --> 03:16:15.060]   It was horrible.
[03:16:15.060 --> 03:16:17.300]   - But you had like a thing to look forward to
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:18.140]   with the sidewalk.
[03:16:18.140 --> 03:16:19.900]   - I had a light at the end of the tunnel.
[03:16:19.900 --> 03:16:22.500]   And I knew if I got to the light,
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:23.740]   was the worst that's gonna happen.
[03:16:23.740 --> 03:16:25.060]   Just get to the light.
[03:16:25.060 --> 03:16:28.380]   But at that point, like again, I had a son,
[03:16:28.380 --> 03:16:29.700]   I had a husband, I had a great company,
[03:16:29.700 --> 03:16:33.340]   I have a great house, I have a nice car, I have everything.
[03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:35.540]   Why did I wanna die every minute of the day?
[03:16:36.540 --> 03:16:38.460]   I was at that point again.
[03:16:38.460 --> 03:16:40.980]   And I'm like, this is God, something's gotta give.
[03:16:40.980 --> 03:16:44.260]   And so I went and I got there.
[03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:48.620]   And she is
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:59.020]   the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity
[03:17:02.340 --> 03:17:07.340]   or visualization, whatever you wanna deem ayahuasca as,
[03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:10.140]   Mama Aya is real.
[03:17:10.140 --> 03:17:13.380]   And she takes no prisoners.
[03:17:13.380 --> 03:17:19.420]   She shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself,
[03:17:19.420 --> 03:17:24.420]   but she does not discriminate against
[03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:25.980]   whether you're ready or not.
[03:17:25.980 --> 03:17:28.860]   If you've ingested it, she's coming for you.
[03:17:30.140 --> 03:17:32.580]   And she's gonna be either gentle
[03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:34.380]   or she's gonna beat your ass.
[03:17:34.380 --> 03:17:35.940]   And sometimes that's what you need,
[03:17:35.940 --> 03:17:40.940]   but she does it in a way that is profound.
[03:17:40.940 --> 03:17:46.780]   - So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?
[03:17:46.780 --> 03:17:49.900]   What are the places it took you?
[03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:52.140]   These people had you meet?
[03:17:52.140 --> 03:17:56.580]   - For the first time, I got to be in a group of people
[03:17:56.580 --> 03:17:59.340]   who didn't judge me or question my service.
[03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:01.300]   They just respect me.
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:02.940]   That was number one.
[03:18:02.940 --> 03:18:06.020]   So that group I lost, I just found again.
[03:18:06.020 --> 03:18:11.180]   Big shocker, I was the only woman there again.
[03:18:11.180 --> 03:18:14.920]   Ooh, seems to be the thing for me.
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:18.460]   And so I was surrounded by all these special operators.
[03:18:18.460 --> 03:18:19.760]   Like these aren't like normal soldiers.
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:24.020]   Like these guys that I'm with are like bronze star,
[03:18:24.020 --> 03:18:29.020]   fucking purple heart, just the coolest people.
[03:18:29.620 --> 03:18:32.140]   People I've always wanted to be like, that's my buddy.
[03:18:32.140 --> 03:18:34.060]   Now I can be like, those are my buddies.
[03:18:34.060 --> 03:18:36.620]   Like those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.
[03:18:36.620 --> 03:18:38.180]   They will bend over backwards.
[03:18:38.180 --> 03:18:40.060]   They will exfil me out of anywhere.
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:41.660]   They will take a bullet for me.
[03:18:41.660 --> 03:18:45.860]   And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn't expect.
[03:18:45.860 --> 03:18:48.260]   So that hit me weird right off the get.
[03:18:48.260 --> 03:18:52.100]   I was nervous and now I was just felt at home for a minute.
[03:18:52.100 --> 03:18:54.100]   And then when I stepped into ceremony,
[03:18:57.140 --> 03:18:59.780]   the first night, 'cause you do three nights
[03:18:59.780 --> 03:19:02.260]   over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[03:19:02.260 --> 03:19:06.700]   The first night I was so nervous and so anxious
[03:19:06.700 --> 03:19:10.580]   'cause you go up in ceremony and the shamans come in
[03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:12.180]   and they cleanse themselves.
[03:19:12.180 --> 03:19:16.420]   And then you get served the ayah individually.
[03:19:16.420 --> 03:19:17.980]   You go up, they give it to you.
[03:19:17.980 --> 03:19:19.220]   You can take your time and pray.
[03:19:19.220 --> 03:19:21.540]   You can do whatever you want and then you drink it.
[03:19:21.540 --> 03:19:26.540]   I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there
[03:19:27.380 --> 03:19:30.020]   and I was like trying to keep it in,
[03:19:30.020 --> 03:19:33.100]   but I could feel that like heat come from my toes
[03:19:33.100 --> 03:19:34.940]   all the way up and you're like, your mouth starts to water.
[03:19:34.940 --> 03:19:37.140]   I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up.
[03:19:37.140 --> 03:19:39.100]   And I looked over to Griff and I looked at Bishop
[03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:41.100]   and I'm like, swallow it.
[03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:45.180]   I was like, okay.
[03:19:45.180 --> 03:19:47.540]   And you can't talk or anything.
[03:19:47.540 --> 03:19:51.220]   So I like my buddy, we call him the Viking,
[03:19:51.220 --> 03:19:52.180]   a soul Viking.
[03:19:52.180 --> 03:19:53.580]   He looks like a Viking.
[03:19:53.580 --> 03:19:54.700]   His head's tattooed.
[03:19:54.700 --> 03:19:57.300]   He's been on the show.
[03:19:57.300 --> 03:19:58.700]   He's so cool.
[03:19:58.700 --> 03:20:00.620]   He's sitting directly across like you and I
[03:20:00.620 --> 03:20:01.780]   and he can see me and he's looking at me
[03:20:01.780 --> 03:20:06.780]   and I'm throwing up and I do it about three times.
[03:20:06.780 --> 03:20:09.260]   And then the last time he just saw me and I couldn't do it.
[03:20:09.260 --> 03:20:11.980]   I just, I threw it up.
[03:20:11.980 --> 03:20:16.300]   And so I like to think that was her way of easing me in.
[03:20:16.300 --> 03:20:18.820]   So I didn't get like a full punch to the face,
[03:20:18.820 --> 03:20:20.860]   but I gotta, let me take your hand
[03:20:20.860 --> 03:20:22.460]   and show you what I'm gonna show you.
[03:20:22.460 --> 03:20:23.460]   We're gonna make you better.
[03:20:23.460 --> 03:20:25.020]   We're gonna take the pain away.
[03:20:25.020 --> 03:20:26.980]   - Aren't you supposed to eventually throw up
[03:20:26.980 --> 03:20:27.820]   no matter what?
[03:20:27.820 --> 03:20:28.660]   - It's not supposed to.
[03:20:28.660 --> 03:20:29.580]   Some people don't.
[03:20:29.580 --> 03:20:30.660]   You purge, yeah.
[03:20:30.660 --> 03:20:32.700]   If something's happening, you're going through something,
[03:20:32.700 --> 03:20:34.860]   yeah, you purge, but it doesn't have to happen.
[03:20:34.860 --> 03:20:37.940]   But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no.
[03:20:37.940 --> 03:20:40.940]   This takes like, you gotta sit and meditate for,
[03:20:40.940 --> 03:20:43.620]   or sit still basically and meditate in the pitch black
[03:20:43.620 --> 03:20:46.300]   for about 45 minutes before the effects even,
[03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:48.180]   before you even feel her.
[03:20:48.180 --> 03:20:50.060]   So it's very--
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:52.740]   - So here she figured out the right dose you need.
[03:20:52.740 --> 03:20:55.620]   - Well, because I did the same dose as everyone else.
[03:20:55.620 --> 03:20:58.320]   I think it was 20 mils, which doesn't seem like a lot.
[03:20:58.320 --> 03:21:01.460]   But when you've never done it, it is.
[03:21:01.460 --> 03:21:07.380]   So I felt like such a bitch.
[03:21:07.380 --> 03:21:09.260]   God, I felt like such a bitch.
[03:21:09.260 --> 03:21:11.540]   - Okay, that was the thought going through your mind.
[03:21:11.540 --> 03:21:13.140]   - Oh, you just fucked it all up.
[03:21:13.140 --> 03:21:13.980]   You ruined it.
[03:21:13.980 --> 03:21:14.940]   You ruined this again.
[03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:16.300]   You couldn't do this, right?
[03:21:16.300 --> 03:21:17.140]   - Yeah.
[03:21:17.140 --> 03:21:19.740]   - And so at that point,
[03:21:20.700 --> 03:21:22.820]   we went through the meditation part
[03:21:22.820 --> 03:21:24.180]   and the shamans were,
[03:21:24.180 --> 03:21:26.740]   they literally sing for like six hours straight.
[03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:27.780]   - So you said that you take it
[03:21:27.780 --> 03:21:30.940]   and then there's just what you're quietly listening to them.
[03:21:30.940 --> 03:21:33.900]   - Meditate and you wait and you wait
[03:21:33.900 --> 03:21:34.940]   and you're in pitch black,
[03:21:34.940 --> 03:21:37.100]   like can't see this far in front of your face.
[03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:37.940]   - Cool.
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:39.380]   - And you have a little puke bucket
[03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:42.100]   and then you have a little light that has a red filter on it
[03:21:42.100 --> 03:21:43.420]   that you have to get up to go to the bathroom
[03:21:43.420 --> 03:21:44.260]   to get out of the yurt.
[03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:47.020]   You use that so you don't turn lights on.
[03:21:47.020 --> 03:21:50.180]   And me, I brought like what?
[03:21:50.180 --> 03:21:53.220]   - No, it's just a cool visual of just a puke bucket
[03:21:53.220 --> 03:21:54.700]   and a little light for the,
[03:21:54.700 --> 03:21:56.740]   like I can imagine these like little lights
[03:21:56.740 --> 03:21:57.740]   going there once in a while
[03:21:57.740 --> 03:22:00.180]   and then the rest is just in darkness meditating
[03:22:00.180 --> 03:22:03.020]   with this singing.
[03:22:03.020 --> 03:22:04.860]   - It's so beautiful.
[03:22:04.860 --> 03:22:07.180]   I'll take you sometime 'cause trust me,
[03:22:07.180 --> 03:22:11.980]   I wouldn't offer if it wasn't the group I would trust.
[03:22:11.980 --> 03:22:14.420]   - Yeah, you had a very interesting group.
[03:22:14.420 --> 03:22:16.580]   So it's the heroic hearts people?
[03:22:16.580 --> 03:22:17.420]   - Yeah, heroic hearts.
[03:22:17.420 --> 03:22:18.900]   So yeah, this is my,
[03:22:18.900 --> 03:22:20.460]   Jesse gave us all these journals.
[03:22:20.460 --> 03:22:22.260]   They're like, you're gonna want these.
[03:22:22.260 --> 03:22:23.620]   So he gave us all these journals
[03:22:23.620 --> 03:22:25.140]   and now this is like my Bible,
[03:22:25.140 --> 03:22:28.660]   like my work, my everything goes in this with me everywhere.
[03:22:28.660 --> 03:22:31.220]   It's just this like silent reminder for me.
[03:22:31.220 --> 03:22:34.980]   And so heroic hearts does fantastic work.
[03:22:34.980 --> 03:22:37.060]   I'll get into them after.
[03:22:37.060 --> 03:22:42.060]   The thing with this group is there's such care.
[03:22:42.060 --> 03:22:46.540]   It's not like go do AYA and like you're done.
[03:22:46.540 --> 03:22:48.060]   There's like integration coaches
[03:22:48.060 --> 03:22:49.180]   and there's like doctors
[03:22:49.180 --> 03:22:50.580]   and there's like people to make sure
[03:22:50.580 --> 03:22:52.660]   that you're doing the work
[03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:55.260]   because AYA is just the gate.
[03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:56.780]   Now you have to take it
[03:22:56.780 --> 03:22:59.620]   and you have to implement it into your life.
[03:22:59.620 --> 03:23:00.780]   People don't do that though.
[03:23:00.780 --> 03:23:02.660]   - Did you do like integration?
[03:23:02.660 --> 03:23:04.380]   Did you do conversations with somebody?
[03:23:04.380 --> 03:23:07.460]   Did you talk to like, is there a process to,
[03:23:07.460 --> 03:23:10.340]   'cause similar with psilocybin you mentioned,
[03:23:10.340 --> 03:23:14.100]   as I understand it's exceptionally beneficial
[03:23:14.100 --> 03:23:16.580]   for when you also do like talk therapy,
[03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:19.820]   like you couple that with the integration in some form
[03:23:19.820 --> 03:23:21.660]   where you talk through your experience
[03:23:21.660 --> 03:23:23.180]   and you talk through different things.
[03:23:23.180 --> 03:23:25.100]   Like that seems to be a really,
[03:23:25.100 --> 03:23:26.420]   you know, I need to do that more
[03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:28.740]   with basically every substance I take.
[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:31.660]   Like if I get, which I have been every once in a while
[03:23:31.660 --> 03:23:34.340]   known to do a bit of vodka or whiskey or whatever,
[03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:37.580]   like do integration the next day.
[03:23:37.580 --> 03:23:38.460]   - Well, what did you learn?
[03:23:38.460 --> 03:23:39.300]   What did you get from that?
[03:23:39.300 --> 03:23:40.140]   - What did you get?
[03:23:40.140 --> 03:23:40.980]   Because you learn a lot,
[03:23:40.980 --> 03:23:42.660]   but you sometimes kind of just move on
[03:23:42.660 --> 03:23:44.100]   and you celebrate that that happened,
[03:23:44.100 --> 03:23:46.140]   but like really kind of think through it.
[03:23:46.140 --> 03:23:47.500]   Write it down.
[03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:49.940]   It's important because that's what this was.
[03:23:49.940 --> 03:23:52.820]   So the first night I'll give like a very,
[03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:55.300]   'cause trust me, we could spend a whole podcast
[03:23:55.300 --> 03:23:57.020]   on both of the, all three of those nights.
[03:23:57.020 --> 03:23:59.580]   But the first night, the biggest thing that happened for me
[03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:03.780]   is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby.
[03:24:03.780 --> 03:24:07.220]   And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[03:24:07.220 --> 03:24:08.300]   Fuck you.
[03:24:08.300 --> 03:24:09.220]   That was my daughter.
[03:24:09.220 --> 03:24:12.580]   And I'm very aware it was, I'm very conscious that it was.
[03:24:12.580 --> 03:24:16.540]   And at that point, she just eased me in enough
[03:24:16.540 --> 03:24:20.500]   to let me know and showed me enough that this wasn't it.
[03:24:20.500 --> 03:24:23.500]   This wasn't the end all be all.
[03:24:23.500 --> 03:24:25.900]   Where you are right now on this plane,
[03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:29.660]   on this dimension, in this life, this is a blip.
[03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:34.580]   And it is so minuscule to the big picture.
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:36.260]   And so she really did that by,
[03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:40.180]   she showed me just a black and then like a crack
[03:24:40.180 --> 03:24:42.700]   and then these vibrant colors that I can't describe
[03:24:42.700 --> 03:24:44.100]   because there aren't words.
[03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:47.860]   Alex Gray does really great art.
[03:24:47.860 --> 03:24:49.380]   And that is like been the closest thing
[03:24:49.380 --> 03:24:51.380]   I've been able to find colors.
[03:24:51.380 --> 03:24:56.380]   He's a famous guy who does ayahuasca and he's an artist.
[03:24:56.380 --> 03:24:59.020]   I think he's got stuff in New York as well.
[03:24:59.020 --> 03:25:04.020]   But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief
[03:25:04.020 --> 03:25:08.660]   and showed me enough that I could go,
[03:25:08.660 --> 03:25:09.940]   I could wake up the next day
[03:25:09.940 --> 03:25:11.580]   and not wanna die the next day.
[03:25:11.580 --> 03:25:14.420]   And so what Heroic Heart said,
[03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:15.780]   because it gave us all these journals,
[03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:19.420]   they're like, the next day you kind of wake up
[03:25:19.420 --> 03:25:23.420]   and you do a meet, like a meeting.
[03:25:23.420 --> 03:25:25.460]   You do like a circle, all of us sit in a room
[03:25:25.460 --> 03:25:27.780]   and talk about what just happened the night before.
[03:25:27.780 --> 03:25:30.860]   People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen.
[03:25:30.860 --> 03:25:32.260]   And that's what you do.
[03:25:32.260 --> 03:25:35.020]   And then you write on your free time.
[03:25:35.020 --> 03:25:37.540]   So after that, it's like up to you what you wanna do.
[03:25:37.540 --> 03:25:39.020]   Do you wanna just go walk in the woods?
[03:25:39.020 --> 03:25:41.340]   Well, I chose to go find a fence post
[03:25:41.340 --> 03:25:43.500]   and lie on it for an hour.
[03:25:43.500 --> 03:25:44.340]   I'm not kidding.
[03:25:44.340 --> 03:25:45.820]   I lied there and stared up at these two eagles
[03:25:45.820 --> 03:25:47.900]   that were just in like the middle.
[03:25:47.900 --> 03:25:49.620]   I'll tell you where we were after and you'll be like,
[03:25:49.620 --> 03:25:50.900]   oh, okay, I get it.
[03:25:50.900 --> 03:25:54.980]   And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book
[03:25:54.980 --> 03:25:59.980]   and I just lied there for hours.
[03:25:59.980 --> 03:26:03.860]   And then she all of a sudden started giving me
[03:26:03.860 --> 03:26:05.820]   what you call your downloads.
[03:26:05.820 --> 03:26:07.540]   So the stuff you learn,
[03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:09.260]   the stuff that all of a sudden you're remembering
[03:26:09.260 --> 03:26:10.980]   and these messages that come through.
[03:26:10.980 --> 03:26:12.340]   And that's what this is.
[03:26:12.340 --> 03:26:15.580]   - What kind of things are we talking about?
[03:26:15.580 --> 03:26:19.940]   - So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me
[03:26:19.940 --> 03:26:23.180]   at the beginning of that first night was that I don't breathe.
[03:26:23.180 --> 03:26:29.860]   I just, I don't, I don't breathe.
[03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:32.940]   I don't fucking breathe at all.
[03:26:32.940 --> 03:26:34.540]   I just, one thing to the next thing,
[03:26:34.540 --> 03:26:35.380]   the next thing, the next thing,
[03:26:35.380 --> 03:26:36.260]   the next thing just to survive.
[03:26:36.260 --> 03:26:39.060]   I don't take a minute and breathe.
[03:26:39.060 --> 03:26:41.180]   And so she made, when I say she,
[03:26:41.180 --> 03:26:43.180]   and I say it because it's hard for people to understand,
[03:26:43.180 --> 03:26:44.460]   but I showed this to my husband,
[03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:46.740]   I showed it to my doctors and they're like,
[03:26:46.740 --> 03:26:47.740]   bitch, that's not you.
[03:26:47.740 --> 03:26:48.580]   You don't write like that.
[03:26:48.580 --> 03:26:50.020]   You don't talk like that.
[03:26:50.020 --> 03:26:52.900]   So like you can flip through it, but it was like,
[03:26:52.900 --> 03:26:58.180]   I'll just give, I'll just let Lex read for a second
[03:26:58.180 --> 03:26:59.700]   and just, I'll just do, here, let me do,
[03:26:59.700 --> 03:27:00.940]   I'll do an ad for Heroic Hearts.
[03:27:00.940 --> 03:27:04.500]   Heroic Hearts, here, I'll get my papers while you read.
[03:27:04.500 --> 03:27:07.220]   Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.
[03:27:07.220 --> 03:27:08.060]   Do you mind if I read some of these?
[03:27:08.060 --> 03:27:09.460]   - You can read some of it, yeah.
[03:27:09.460 --> 03:27:11.060]   Go right ahead.
[03:27:11.060 --> 03:27:13.300]   - The dark has lifted.
[03:27:13.300 --> 03:27:16.700]   - Judge my spelling and I'll punch you right in the face.
[03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:18.340]   - Well, there's like--
[03:27:18.340 --> 03:27:19.700]   - It's very sporadic-y.
[03:27:19.700 --> 03:27:22.460]   Sporadically written.
[03:27:22.460 --> 03:27:24.100]   - It's okay to be still.
[03:27:24.100 --> 03:27:25.780]   It's okay to be quiet.
[03:27:25.780 --> 03:27:32.140]   This is good, like, and these are over a stretch of--
[03:27:32.140 --> 03:27:34.420]   - That was the first, the first couple of pages
[03:27:34.420 --> 03:27:36.380]   were from the first night.
[03:27:36.380 --> 03:27:37.220]   This was just that weekend.
[03:27:37.220 --> 03:27:40.740]   - And you're just there laying looking at the eagles.
[03:27:40.740 --> 03:27:44.260]   - Yeah, with the pen just frantic as well, Lex.
[03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:46.260]   Not like writing where you're like, oh, I'm just writing.
[03:27:46.260 --> 03:27:49.980]   It's like, I had to get it down or I was gonna lose it.
[03:27:49.980 --> 03:27:56.940]   - You are warrior, you are power, you can.
[03:27:56.940 --> 03:28:02.540]   Choose now, breathe now, be now.
[03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:08.540]   Be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe.
[03:28:08.540 --> 03:28:13.700]   Be the strength, you are the strength.
[03:28:13.700 --> 03:28:16.900]   There's some soul searching going on here.
[03:28:16.900 --> 03:28:18.620]   This is incredible.
[03:28:18.620 --> 03:28:20.660]   - Yeah, we wait till you get in there.
[03:28:20.660 --> 03:28:23.740]   She gets deep, real aggressive, like--
[03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:28.620]   - Crack the door, for I am the light.
[03:28:28.620 --> 03:28:31.500]   The giver, the taker.
[03:28:31.860 --> 03:28:36.860]   I am warrior, I am life, I am air, I am water, I am fire.
[03:28:36.860 --> 03:28:40.740]   I am light.
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:48.140]   This will, this can, this will, this can.
[03:28:48.140 --> 03:28:51.060]   For I am warrior.
[03:28:51.060 --> 03:28:55.220]   For I am light.
[03:28:55.220 --> 03:28:56.220]   And there's a leaf here.
[03:28:56.220 --> 03:28:57.940]   What's the story with the leaf?
[03:28:57.940 --> 03:29:00.100]   - I don't know, I was walking and every single time
[03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:05.100]   over those three days, any time I went for a walk by myself,
[03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:08.620]   I would just hear like, take this,
[03:29:08.620 --> 03:29:10.380]   just almost as if a voice was standing there,
[03:29:10.380 --> 03:29:11.980]   be like, you need this, take it with you
[03:29:11.980 --> 03:29:15.220]   and keep it in your book, keep it, ground you.
[03:29:15.220 --> 03:29:17.340]   And it just goes on.
[03:29:17.340 --> 03:29:18.540]   - So this is from there.
[03:29:18.540 --> 03:29:19.380]   - Yeah.
[03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:23.220]   - It's cool to have, it's almost like time travel.
[03:29:23.220 --> 03:29:24.740]   - I have poppies from France too.
[03:29:24.740 --> 03:29:28.580]   When I did a 75th anniversary D-Day ride in France
[03:29:28.580 --> 03:29:32.060]   where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity
[03:29:32.060 --> 03:29:34.900]   and we landed on the beaches of Juneau on the 75th
[03:29:34.900 --> 03:29:38.060]   and we got to go by the poppy fields
[03:29:38.060 --> 03:29:40.660]   and I'm like covered in poppies.
[03:29:40.660 --> 03:29:42.660]   And I have some in a book.
[03:29:42.660 --> 03:29:44.180]   I don't know why I do that.
[03:29:44.180 --> 03:29:46.940]   I just, I do that.
[03:29:46.940 --> 03:29:49.420]   - That's cool because like, these are your thoughts
[03:29:49.420 --> 03:29:50.980]   and those are the physical items
[03:29:50.980 --> 03:29:54.180]   as it really helps transport to that place somehow.
[03:29:54.180 --> 03:29:57.100]   Let the light in, let her in.
[03:29:58.100 --> 03:29:58.940]   - Yeah.
[03:29:58.940 --> 03:30:02.820]   And she would show me these visuals
[03:30:02.820 --> 03:30:04.940]   so my drawings are just like, ah.
[03:30:04.940 --> 03:30:12.180]   - Yeah, there's drawings here and you're seeing this stuff.
[03:30:12.180 --> 03:30:13.020]   - Oh yeah.
[03:30:13.020 --> 03:30:16.620]   I can't draw either so that's why they're so,
[03:30:16.620 --> 03:30:19.860]   I wish I could draw because if only I could translate
[03:30:19.860 --> 03:30:22.900]   what I could see visually onto paper.
[03:30:22.900 --> 03:30:25.980]   - And you're talking to her.
[03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:27.140]   - Yeah.
[03:30:27.140 --> 03:30:29.500]   - It's time, I'm here to listen.
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:34.580]   Is this Mama Aya?
[03:30:34.580 --> 03:30:35.900]   - Yeah, we call her Mama Aya.
[03:30:35.900 --> 03:30:38.220]   - Mama Aya, Mama Aya.
[03:30:38.220 --> 03:30:41.060]   So who are you seeing?
[03:30:41.060 --> 03:30:42.300]   Is this a woman?
[03:30:42.300 --> 03:30:46.060]   - So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky.
[03:30:46.060 --> 03:30:48.660]   These unbelievably gorgeous, beautiful eyes
[03:30:48.660 --> 03:30:51.020]   that I, and I was like literally looking up
[03:30:51.020 --> 03:30:53.100]   at the top of the yurt and I kept going to myself,
[03:30:53.100 --> 03:30:54.900]   is anyone else seeing this?
[03:30:54.900 --> 03:30:56.500]   There's eyes in the sky.
[03:30:56.500 --> 03:30:57.340]   - Man.
[03:30:57.340 --> 03:30:59.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:30:59.020 --> 03:31:01.940]   And so there's these eyes floating
[03:31:01.940 --> 03:31:03.900]   and they just kept looking at me
[03:31:03.900 --> 03:31:06.060]   and I remember when I kept telling myself like,
[03:31:06.060 --> 03:31:07.460]   oh, don't worry about it, there's nothing there.
[03:31:07.460 --> 03:31:08.540]   She would get angry.
[03:31:08.540 --> 03:31:12.580]   I'm right here, pay attention to me.
[03:31:12.580 --> 03:31:17.540]   And I'd be like, okay, like forceful, like very forceful.
[03:31:17.540 --> 03:31:19.180]   So at first it was just the eyes.
[03:31:19.180 --> 03:31:21.940]   The second night,
[03:31:23.980 --> 03:31:25.700]   I sound crazy when I say this.
[03:31:25.700 --> 03:31:33.700]   Great, that's gonna be my clip, I sound crazy.
[03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:35.780]   It's what I do when I get uncomfortable.
[03:31:35.780 --> 03:31:38.060]   I do weird hand gestures and movements.
[03:31:38.060 --> 03:31:39.940]   - Voices, I like it.
[03:31:39.940 --> 03:31:41.140]   - Yeah, I do, yeah.
[03:31:41.140 --> 03:31:43.340]   You would hate to be in my office
[03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:44.940]   'cause most of the day it's just,
[03:31:44.940 --> 03:31:50.340]   this weird lunges and uncomfortable moments.
[03:31:50.340 --> 03:31:53.300]   She turned me into a wolf.
[03:31:54.300 --> 03:31:57.860]   I know I said it out loud, I hear it, I said it.
[03:31:57.860 --> 03:31:58.700]   - Yeah.
[03:31:58.700 --> 03:31:59.540]   - Head to toe.
[03:31:59.540 --> 03:32:04.740]   And her takeaway for me was,
[03:32:04.740 --> 03:32:06.780]   I am trying to be this pack leader,
[03:32:06.780 --> 03:32:08.380]   I'm trying to be this leader in my life,
[03:32:08.380 --> 03:32:10.220]   I'm trying to do these things,
[03:32:10.220 --> 03:32:12.500]   but I'm going about them the whole wrong way.
[03:32:12.500 --> 03:32:15.180]   So like when the shamans call you up
[03:32:15.180 --> 03:32:17.460]   to do their special prayer over you,
[03:32:17.460 --> 03:32:18.900]   you go up, you don't touch them,
[03:32:18.900 --> 03:32:19.980]   they flash their little light,
[03:32:19.980 --> 03:32:21.220]   you see the little light spot,
[03:32:21.220 --> 03:32:23.940]   you walk to the light, you sit down on the light.
[03:32:23.940 --> 03:32:25.820]   And then my shaman, he's so funny
[03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:27.540]   'cause he's got this great tone in his voice,
[03:32:27.540 --> 03:32:30.500]   he goes, "How you doing, Kelsey?"
[03:32:30.500 --> 03:32:36.380]   And I'm like, "So, hi, yeah, I have a problem.
[03:32:36.380 --> 03:32:39.540]   "I'm a wolf and I need it to stop."
[03:32:39.540 --> 03:32:42.020]   And he'd be like, "Don't you worry, girl, I got you.
[03:32:42.020 --> 03:32:42.860]   "You ready?"
[03:32:42.860 --> 03:32:45.300]   And I was like, "Uh-huh, uh-huh."
[03:32:45.300 --> 03:32:46.420]   And so I'm sitting there cross-legged,
[03:32:46.420 --> 03:32:48.340]   I've got my palms out like this.
[03:32:48.340 --> 03:32:50.220]   And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury,
[03:32:50.220 --> 03:32:51.860]   so I don't just sit slanted like this,
[03:32:51.860 --> 03:32:53.700]   my shoulder's actually permanently detached
[03:32:53.700 --> 03:32:56.020]   and no one in the world will touch it or fix it.
[03:32:56.020 --> 03:32:58.420]   My collarbone comes out my back here.
[03:32:58.420 --> 03:33:00.860]   And I don't have any collarbone here.
[03:33:00.860 --> 03:33:03.660]   So nobody will fix it, no one will touch it.
[03:33:03.660 --> 03:33:05.740]   Even I've had specialists, I've had surgeries,
[03:33:05.740 --> 03:33:06.860]   no one will do anything with it.
[03:33:06.860 --> 03:33:09.620]   So I'm permanently down and forward.
[03:33:09.620 --> 03:33:11.260]   So I slouch.
[03:33:11.260 --> 03:33:14.340]   It's horrible.
[03:33:14.340 --> 03:33:16.860]   - Horrible functionally too?
[03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:19.380]   - Oh, there's nothing, I can't do a pull-up anymore.
[03:33:19.380 --> 03:33:22.420]   - Oh, so weak.
[03:33:22.420 --> 03:33:23.260]   - Oh, wow.
[03:33:23.260 --> 03:33:24.420]   - Oh, I'll show you how to do a push-up
[03:33:24.420 --> 03:33:26.940]   after you'll fucking throw up in embarrassment.
[03:33:26.940 --> 03:33:27.780]   Yeah, it's bad.
[03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:29.660]   So before I, though, chronic pain,
[03:33:29.660 --> 03:33:31.900]   like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day
[03:33:31.900 --> 03:33:33.220]   just 'cause the pain is so bad
[03:33:33.220 --> 03:33:35.340]   because the trauma in it was so bad.
[03:33:35.340 --> 03:33:36.980]   The surgery went wrong.
[03:33:36.980 --> 03:33:41.580]   The collarbone dissipated and no longer exists.
[03:33:41.580 --> 03:33:43.740]   And they're not sure how I lift things with it
[03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:44.900]   and do stuff with it.
[03:33:44.900 --> 03:33:47.020]   It's like overcompensation everywhere.
[03:33:48.380 --> 03:33:53.260]   My back, like my scapula like flares outward.
[03:33:53.260 --> 03:33:54.780]   I'm all messed up from it.
[03:33:54.780 --> 03:33:56.420]   And so I was in chronic pain.
[03:33:56.420 --> 03:33:58.340]   So he's praying over me.
[03:33:58.340 --> 03:34:01.180]   And all of a sudden, all I feel is this arm
[03:34:01.180 --> 03:34:04.340]   just start just fucking vibrating.
[03:34:04.340 --> 03:34:05.860]   And my hair is really long.
[03:34:05.860 --> 03:34:08.500]   And I feel somebody grab the back of my ponytail
[03:34:08.500 --> 03:34:11.060]   and snap my head back like this.
[03:34:11.060 --> 03:34:15.460]   And it felt like something was coming out of my throat,
[03:34:15.460 --> 03:34:17.940]   like being pulled out of me.
[03:34:18.860 --> 03:34:20.580]   And the takeaway that I end up
[03:34:20.580 --> 03:34:21.620]   in the whole of the rest of the night,
[03:34:21.620 --> 03:34:22.580]   there was a million other things,
[03:34:22.580 --> 03:34:24.100]   but the takeaway was
[03:34:24.100 --> 03:34:30.100]   you no longer need to bite.
[03:34:30.100 --> 03:34:32.540]   You may only show your teeth.
[03:34:32.540 --> 03:34:35.260]   You can be the leader that you want to be.
[03:34:35.260 --> 03:34:39.420]   You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.
[03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:41.100]   You can be in the back of the pack.
[03:34:41.100 --> 03:34:44.180]   You have to watch the rest around you.
[03:34:44.180 --> 03:34:46.540]   Be mindful of those around you
[03:34:46.540 --> 03:34:48.300]   instead of just being up front.
[03:34:48.300 --> 03:34:50.580]   Be behind as well.
[03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:52.500]   Make sure that everything that you're doing
[03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:54.540]   is all being looked after.
[03:34:54.540 --> 03:34:57.100]   Because my thing was, I will rip your fucking head off
[03:34:57.100 --> 03:34:59.780]   if you just say the wrong thing to me before.
[03:34:59.780 --> 03:35:01.940]   The whole thing was you can just show your teeth
[03:35:01.940 --> 03:35:03.540]   and that is more than enough.
[03:35:03.540 --> 03:35:07.180]   Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.
[03:35:07.180 --> 03:35:09.300]   You don't need to do that any longer.
[03:35:09.300 --> 03:35:12.580]   And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen
[03:35:12.580 --> 03:35:16.060]   like where I was in my house.
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:19.940]   And there were these flyers all over my husband and my son.
[03:35:19.940 --> 03:35:22.620]   And I went ham on them.
[03:35:22.620 --> 03:35:25.140]   I shredded them to pieces.
[03:35:25.140 --> 03:35:27.700]   I was this protector.
[03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:31.100]   And it's crazy 'cause the guys told me after,
[03:35:31.100 --> 03:35:32.300]   someone would be like,
[03:35:32.300 --> 03:35:35.100]   "There were flyers all over you the whole night.
[03:35:35.100 --> 03:35:36.220]   They were just all over you."
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:39.180]   And I'm like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.
[03:35:39.180 --> 03:35:40.820]   The shaman had to be like,
[03:35:40.820 --> 03:35:43.220]   "I need you to try to calm your breathing."
[03:35:43.220 --> 03:35:44.660]   After I could, but before,
[03:35:44.660 --> 03:35:48.220]   I was attacking things beside me
[03:35:48.220 --> 03:35:50.740]   that people could see and I could see,
[03:35:50.740 --> 03:35:53.380]   but couldn't wrap my brain around that they were real.
[03:35:53.380 --> 03:35:56.020]   Like it was weird.
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:35:58.340]   It was crazy, man.
[03:35:58.340 --> 03:35:59.260]   - That's day two.
[03:35:59.260 --> 03:36:00.700]   - That's day two.
[03:36:00.700 --> 03:36:03.780]   - And so what's the big takeaway there?
[03:36:03.780 --> 03:36:05.820]   - My takeaway was I needed to be,
[03:36:05.820 --> 03:36:09.980]   I needed to stop trying to,
[03:36:09.980 --> 03:36:12.060]   stop trying to push everything too hard.
[03:36:12.060 --> 03:36:14.500]   Stop trying to force everything.
[03:36:14.500 --> 03:36:15.660]   It's all going to come.
[03:36:15.660 --> 03:36:17.420]   It's all going to happen,
[03:36:17.420 --> 03:36:20.180]   but you are too aggressive.
[03:36:20.180 --> 03:36:24.460]   You are too, you're trying so hard that you're missing,
[03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:26.100]   you're missing everything else.
[03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:27.020]   - Got it.
[03:36:27.020 --> 03:36:30.340]   That's just how to be a better human kind of thing.
[03:36:30.340 --> 03:36:31.180]   - Right.
[03:36:31.180 --> 03:36:34.820]   - This is getting intense.
[03:36:34.820 --> 03:36:37.020]   - Yeah, it gets aggressive.
[03:36:37.020 --> 03:36:38.380]   Yeah, it gets aggressive.
[03:36:38.380 --> 03:36:42.500]   - I mean, there's love and light still.
[03:36:42.500 --> 03:36:44.260]   - It gets better. - Love and light.
[03:36:44.580 --> 03:36:46.980]   Love and light, the warrior within is calm.
[03:36:46.980 --> 03:36:50.420]   She will test you daily.
[03:36:50.420 --> 03:36:52.140]   Show her respect.
[03:36:52.140 --> 03:36:52.980]   - So that's what I mean.
[03:36:52.980 --> 03:36:53.820]   You've read my book.
[03:36:53.820 --> 03:36:55.340]   You know I don't write like that.
[03:36:55.340 --> 03:36:57.100]   - Yeah, this is strange.
[03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:59.540]   - See, good, you get it.
[03:36:59.540 --> 03:37:02.580]   'Cause people don't understand when I say I didn't,
[03:37:02.580 --> 03:37:04.740]   I don't feel like I wrote that.
[03:37:04.740 --> 03:37:06.140]   I feel like she gave me,
[03:37:06.140 --> 03:37:09.100]   like I reread this all of the time.
[03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:12.740]   - So I wonder, I mean, well, not obviously,
[03:37:12.740 --> 03:37:16.260]   but this is somehow part of you.
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:18.340]   - I think it's a part of me, obviously.
[03:37:18.340 --> 03:37:20.460]   - Reconnecting you somehow to that part.
[03:37:20.460 --> 03:37:22.740]   It kind of is incredible to think of
[03:37:22.740 --> 03:37:24.540]   what are the things that are part of us
[03:37:24.540 --> 03:37:26.820]   that we haven't really explored, you know?
[03:37:26.820 --> 03:37:28.020]   - And there's so many.
[03:37:28.020 --> 03:37:30.260]   We just get so caught up. - Nature.
[03:37:30.260 --> 03:37:34.300]   To connect to her, feel her flow through them.
[03:37:34.300 --> 03:37:37.180]   Use them for the strength for each day
[03:37:37.180 --> 03:37:39.060]   a new challenge will present itself.
[03:37:40.300 --> 03:37:42.260]   Love, light, breathe.
[03:37:42.260 --> 03:37:44.940]   - Sorry, I have too much hair.
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:46.900]   - Never enough, I used to have long hair.
[03:37:46.900 --> 03:37:48.380]   What about day three?
[03:37:48.380 --> 03:37:52.540]   - So day three is the stuff I talked about on "Jocko"
[03:37:52.540 --> 03:37:55.180]   when I got taken over to the other side.
[03:37:55.180 --> 03:37:57.300]   I almost missed that night too.
[03:37:57.300 --> 03:37:59.220]   I almost missed that ceremony.
[03:37:59.220 --> 03:38:02.500]   I got a false positive on my COVID test
[03:38:02.500 --> 03:38:05.940]   and I got a call from the medical clinic that night
[03:38:05.940 --> 03:38:07.820]   being like, "You need to come in.
[03:38:07.820 --> 03:38:09.780]   "You got a false positive on your COVID test
[03:38:09.780 --> 03:38:12.900]   "and if you're gonna travel, you have to,
[03:38:12.900 --> 03:38:14.020]   "we got to figure this out.
[03:38:14.020 --> 03:38:14.980]   "You got to come do blood work.
[03:38:14.980 --> 03:38:18.300]   "You got to come do whatever it is you need to do
[03:38:18.300 --> 03:38:21.140]   "if you want to get home, but you got to come do something."
[03:38:21.140 --> 03:38:24.940]   And so I didn't think I was gonna be in ceremony.
[03:38:24.940 --> 03:38:25.820]   I had to leave.
[03:38:25.820 --> 03:38:30.820]   So I left and they waited.
[03:38:30.820 --> 03:38:34.220]   They waited for me.
[03:38:34.220 --> 03:38:38.420]   And so I think the biggest takeaway
[03:38:38.420 --> 03:38:43.420]   from all of this for me was this isn't it.
[03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:45.180]   This isn't everything.
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:49.400]   This isn't the end all be all.
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:50.900]   You can fight through this.
[03:38:50.900 --> 03:38:52.380]   This is possible.
[03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:53.460]   It's gonna take work.
[03:38:53.460 --> 03:38:55.460]   It's gonna be fucking hard.
[03:38:55.460 --> 03:38:57.340]   It's worth it though.
[03:38:57.340 --> 03:38:58.820]   And if you just keep going in the right direction,
[03:38:58.820 --> 03:39:02.680]   everything that I wrote down, everything, every goal,
[03:39:02.680 --> 03:39:03.520]   it'll happen.
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:06.980]   - What about love?
[03:39:06.980 --> 03:39:07.900]   - What about love?
[03:39:08.740 --> 03:39:10.860]   - Tell me about your husband, Kelsey.
[03:39:10.860 --> 03:39:12.540]   - Okay, he's the best.
[03:39:12.540 --> 03:39:15.900]   - What role did he play in your life?
[03:39:15.900 --> 03:39:17.420]   - The most pivotal role.
[03:39:17.420 --> 03:39:20.380]   He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough
[03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:23.800]   until I knew that I was worthy enough to be alive.
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:26.300]   - Can you dissect that a little bit?
[03:39:26.300 --> 03:39:29.420]   Like what, I mean, what role does love play
[03:39:29.420 --> 03:39:31.060]   in the human condition?
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:33.680]   - I think love is the only reason
[03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:35.480]   that we haven't destroyed ourselves.
[03:39:37.420 --> 03:39:39.020]   - I mean, we humans in general.
[03:39:39.020 --> 03:39:41.940]   - Yes, I think there is a subset of people
[03:39:41.940 --> 03:39:46.940]   where love will always be, love conquers all,
[03:39:46.940 --> 03:39:49.660]   but that's not always the reality.
[03:39:49.660 --> 03:39:54.220]   The reality is life is messy and humans are messy
[03:39:54.220 --> 03:39:56.500]   and the way we choose to deal with things are messy
[03:39:56.500 --> 03:39:58.020]   and complicated and difficult,
[03:39:58.020 --> 03:40:01.620]   but at the root of all good is love, I think.
[03:40:02.460 --> 03:40:07.020]   And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband
[03:40:07.020 --> 03:40:12.020]   through a friend, which you listened to that podcast,
[03:40:12.020 --> 03:40:14.460]   so I don't know that we need to,
[03:40:14.460 --> 03:40:16.460]   unless you really wanna go into that story again,
[03:40:16.460 --> 03:40:18.340]   how I met my husband.
[03:40:18.340 --> 03:40:20.580]   - Well, the only part of that story,
[03:40:20.580 --> 03:40:22.540]   people should just go listen to the Jocko podcast,
[03:40:22.540 --> 03:40:24.940]   it's how you made him uncomfortable, I love it.
[03:40:24.940 --> 03:40:26.680]   - Well, okay, so how it works, let me explain.
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:29.380]   In the super cross and motocross industry, it's really small.
[03:40:29.380 --> 03:40:30.980]   The people who are professional,
[03:40:30.980 --> 03:40:32.100]   it's a small subset of people.
[03:40:32.100 --> 03:40:35.700]   It's kind of like Formula One, 21 cars, that's what there is.
[03:40:35.700 --> 03:40:36.540]   That's the amount of riders.
[03:40:36.540 --> 03:40:40.140]   - And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.
[03:40:40.140 --> 03:40:41.740]   - My husband was a professional super cross
[03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:44.100]   and motocross racer for his whole life.
[03:40:44.100 --> 03:40:48.500]   And he raced for Kawasaki and Suzuki.
[03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:51.160]   He lived in California and raced all down there.
[03:40:51.160 --> 03:40:54.100]   And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.
[03:40:54.100 --> 03:40:58.220]   And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:41:02.220]   to see somebody that I was currently sleeping with,
[03:41:02.220 --> 03:41:03.860]   who was a friend of mine,
[03:41:03.860 --> 03:41:08.860]   and end up meeting Brady instead.
[03:41:08.860 --> 03:41:10.940]   - Yeah, and the funny moment in Jocko's podcast.
[03:41:10.940 --> 03:41:13.140]   - Which was saying that I was fucking him
[03:41:13.140 --> 03:41:14.820]   instead of just sleeping with him.
[03:41:14.820 --> 03:41:16.860]   And then Jocko's face exploded.
[03:41:16.860 --> 03:41:18.580]   - 'Cause Jocko was like, "Oh, sleeping."
[03:41:18.580 --> 03:41:22.980]   So he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters.
[03:41:22.980 --> 03:41:24.500]   He was trying to get you to define,
[03:41:24.500 --> 03:41:26.700]   as a good interviewer would, "Oh, sleeping, okay."
[03:41:26.700 --> 03:41:29.620]   And then you were like, "It's fucking Jocko."
[03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:31.140]   (laughing)
[03:41:31.140 --> 03:41:31.980]   Or something like that.
[03:41:31.980 --> 03:41:32.820]   - It was something along those lines.
[03:41:32.820 --> 03:41:34.020]   - It was great.
[03:41:34.020 --> 03:41:35.820]   - But that's true, because in that industry,
[03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:38.660]   it's small, we all share.
[03:41:38.660 --> 03:41:41.420]   Trust me, this is what it is.
[03:41:41.420 --> 03:41:42.600]   And anyway, so I met him there
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:44.900]   and he had broken his wrist really bad.
[03:41:44.900 --> 03:41:48.580]   And this was before I deployed.
[03:41:48.580 --> 03:41:52.860]   So I met him and we stayed in touch and just became friends
[03:41:52.860 --> 03:41:55.460]   and just texted, that was it, nothing weird.
[03:41:55.460 --> 03:41:57.500]   And I was deploying though.
[03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:00.140]   So we disagreed, we'd be friends.
[03:42:00.140 --> 03:42:01.220]   We weren't actually talking
[03:42:01.220 --> 03:42:03.820]   about anything romantically at all.
[03:42:03.820 --> 03:42:07.540]   And then I deployed and we got talking
[03:42:07.540 --> 03:42:10.580]   and to know each other a little more, a little more.
[03:42:10.580 --> 03:42:12.540]   And then we decided that we liked each other
[03:42:12.540 --> 03:42:15.380]   and we wanted to try to give it at least a semi shot.
[03:42:15.380 --> 03:42:17.720]   And so when I got home from Afghanistan,
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:22.720]   I went and watched him race one of his last two races
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:26.940]   that he did professionally before he retired, excuse me.
[03:42:26.940 --> 03:42:29.600]   And it was a Montreal and one was in Vegas.
[03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:34.600]   And I hadn't seen him and he didn't really know me.
[03:42:34.600 --> 03:42:36.420]   We didn't really know each other.
[03:42:36.420 --> 03:42:39.160]   We met, I slept in the bed beside him
[03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:41.120]   because my girlfriend didn't wanna get in trouble
[03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:43.820]   from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude.
[03:42:43.820 --> 03:42:49.140]   And then, yeah, we just, we started dating
[03:42:49.140 --> 03:42:53.220]   and he really slowly became my rock.
[03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:55.420]   And he understands trauma.
[03:42:55.420 --> 03:42:57.980]   He had some stuff happen in his life, in his family
[03:42:57.980 --> 03:43:00.620]   that he went through a lot of therapy.
[03:43:00.620 --> 03:43:01.580]   He went through a lot of shit.
[03:43:01.580 --> 03:43:05.420]   He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do
[03:43:05.420 --> 03:43:06.680]   to a family and to people
[03:43:06.680 --> 03:43:09.320]   and those that are suffering with it.
[03:43:09.320 --> 03:43:14.320]   And so he was well-equipped to handle me, thankfully.
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:17.700]   And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance
[03:43:17.700 --> 03:43:19.100]   back and forth, back and forth, and back and forth.
[03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:20.140]   And I finally got the call
[03:43:20.140 --> 03:43:22.620]   that I was gonna be released from the military.
[03:43:22.620 --> 03:43:24.580]   And I wanted to live near him,
[03:43:24.580 --> 03:43:26.260]   but I couldn't afford to live in British Columbia
[03:43:26.260 --> 03:43:28.620]   'cause I was from Ontario and BC's like,
[03:43:28.620 --> 03:43:31.180]   it means bring cash for a reason.
[03:43:31.180 --> 03:43:32.340]   I'm like, there's no way I can live there.
[03:43:32.340 --> 03:43:35.340]   And then his family was like, come live with us.
[03:43:35.340 --> 03:43:38.820]   They had a big enough house.
[03:43:38.820 --> 03:43:40.420]   Trust me, it was fine.
[03:43:40.420 --> 03:43:42.300]   So I was like, okay.
[03:43:42.300 --> 03:43:45.180]   And so I went from like dating this guy long distance
[03:43:45.180 --> 03:43:48.260]   to over, you know, from 2009 to 2011,
[03:43:48.260 --> 03:43:50.660]   just back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[03:43:50.660 --> 03:43:51.820]   And then finally his parents were like,
[03:43:51.820 --> 03:43:53.260]   shit or get off the pot here with her.
[03:43:53.260 --> 03:43:56.540]   Like, come on, you know, it's obvious she loves you.
[03:43:56.540 --> 03:43:58.160]   And I would never say it.
[03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:01.020]   That word just as a love, like it was just like-
[03:44:01.020 --> 03:44:04.020]   - So you guys didn't say love to each other?
[03:44:04.020 --> 03:44:05.260]   - For a long time, for a long time.
[03:44:05.260 --> 03:44:06.500]   'Cause I was dead inside.
[03:44:06.500 --> 03:44:10.860]   I didn't know what that meant because I couldn't feel.
[03:44:10.860 --> 03:44:11.700]   I didn't feel anything.
[03:44:11.700 --> 03:44:15.040]   He loved it because he like, we go do something,
[03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:17.420]   you would never complain about anything.
[03:44:17.420 --> 03:44:19.740]   You wouldn't say a fucking word.
[03:44:19.740 --> 03:44:20.920]   You would just sit there.
[03:44:20.920 --> 03:44:23.560]   And now you got all your feelies back
[03:44:23.560 --> 03:44:26.060]   and your emotions back and now you're too hot
[03:44:26.060 --> 03:44:27.660]   and you're too cold.
[03:44:27.660 --> 03:44:29.580]   Anyways, so yeah, he loved it.
[03:44:29.580 --> 03:44:30.860]   I was numb and dead inside.
[03:44:30.860 --> 03:44:32.100]   Seriously, when I call him back-
[03:44:32.100 --> 03:44:34.100]   - But were you still able to have fun together?
[03:44:34.100 --> 03:44:34.940]   That kind of thing?
[03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:37.340]   Like when you say there's no emotion,
[03:44:37.340 --> 03:44:40.340]   there's more emotion around the basics of like everyday life
[03:44:40.340 --> 03:44:43.980]   but you're still able to just like enjoy shit together?
[03:44:43.980 --> 03:44:46.020]   - I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't-
[03:44:46.020 --> 03:44:49.060]   - Feeling. - Feeling.
[03:44:49.060 --> 03:44:50.380]   I was like, this is fun.
[03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:52.480]   - Yeah, right.
[03:44:52.480 --> 03:44:53.320]   - That was it.
[03:44:53.320 --> 03:44:56.680]   That was surface level like, Lex, this is fun.
[03:44:56.680 --> 03:44:58.160]   Like it wasn't-
[03:44:58.160 --> 03:44:59.440]   - There's nothing there.
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:00.280]   - No, there's nothing there.
[03:45:00.280 --> 03:45:02.280]   Hey, yeah, nothing.
[03:45:02.280 --> 03:45:04.000]   And so we went through that for a long time
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:07.240]   and then I lived with his parents and we lived there
[03:45:07.240 --> 03:45:09.160]   and that was, you know, goddammit,
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.040]   his family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.
[03:45:13.040 --> 03:45:13.880]   I was a nightmare.
[03:45:13.880 --> 03:45:15.640]   Couldn't cook certain food around me anymore.
[03:45:15.640 --> 03:45:17.800]   Couldn't go certain places with me anymore.
[03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:20.920]   Couldn't, you know, crowds were a hard no.
[03:45:20.920 --> 03:45:22.100]   We didn't do Canada today.
[03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:23.300]   And like, I just changed.
[03:45:23.300 --> 03:45:26.860]   I moved in and was like, shit's gotta change
[03:45:26.860 --> 03:45:28.700]   if you guys don't want me to kill everyone.
[03:45:28.700 --> 03:45:32.340]   Like, and they were willing and they were accepting
[03:45:32.340 --> 03:45:33.960]   and they were amazing about it.
[03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:36.220]   And then we finally said, okay, well, like,
[03:45:36.220 --> 03:45:37.700]   is this, we're good?
[03:45:37.700 --> 03:45:42.700]   We're like, I used to say like, I L you.
[03:45:42.700 --> 03:45:44.340]   Like I couldn't say love.
[03:45:44.340 --> 03:45:46.580]   It freaked me out for a long time.
[03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:48.960]   And then I finally said it and then that shit head
[03:45:48.960 --> 03:45:50.720]   said it like a month later and I was like,
[03:45:50.720 --> 03:45:51.560]   that's not fair.
[03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:52.500]   You should have said it the same exact time.
[03:45:52.500 --> 03:45:54.360]   I wanted the response.
[03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:56.680]   And he goes to treatment with me.
[03:45:56.680 --> 03:46:00.160]   He, whatever I need, he knows that like,
[03:46:00.160 --> 03:46:01.300]   hey, it's more for like him.
[03:46:01.300 --> 03:46:02.800]   I'm like, how do I handle her?
[03:46:02.800 --> 03:46:03.800]   - Yeah.
[03:46:03.800 --> 03:46:06.480]   - And then we moved out and we bought a house
[03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:07.920]   and then he took a sweet ass time.
[03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:10.600]   We were dating for four years before we were engaged
[03:46:10.600 --> 03:46:14.240]   'cause just to be sure the crazy wasn't too crazy,
[03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:15.480]   he waited four years on that.
[03:46:15.480 --> 03:46:16.320]   - Smart man.
[03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:17.160]   - Right?
[03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:17.980]   Yeah.
[03:46:17.980 --> 03:46:20.140]   - Or you could say he's just a terrified of commitment,
[03:46:20.140 --> 03:46:20.980]   but both.
[03:46:20.980 --> 03:46:21.900]   - A little bit of both.
[03:46:21.900 --> 03:46:23.860]   Hey, when you were the guy on the posters
[03:46:23.860 --> 03:46:25.780]   that all the girls sign up to,
[03:46:25.780 --> 03:46:27.180]   that send all the dirty pictures,
[03:46:27.180 --> 03:46:28.380]   fucking why are you giving that up?
[03:46:28.380 --> 03:46:29.220]   It's easy.
[03:46:29.220 --> 03:46:31.540]   - Yeah, commitment is a real commitment then.
[03:46:31.540 --> 03:46:32.380]   - Yeah.
[03:46:32.380 --> 03:46:35.960]   - Okay, this is the Jaco reset.
[03:46:35.960 --> 03:46:39.940]   We talked about brass and unity a little bit.
[03:46:39.940 --> 03:46:44.460]   What's the long-term mission goal and dream of your company
[03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:47.620]   and the podcast of the same name?
[03:46:47.620 --> 03:46:50.940]   - So for me, what I've been trying to do with this company
[03:46:50.940 --> 03:46:55.940]   is create a community that can really work together
[03:46:55.940 --> 03:46:58.440]   to not only help vets first responders,
[03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:01.440]   but to really bridge the gap with the civilian population
[03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:03.520]   and letting them know what we kind of go through
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:05.780]   and why it is such a epidemic
[03:47:05.780 --> 03:47:08.300]   and why there is over 22 suicides a day
[03:47:08.300 --> 03:47:11.320]   and we are losing people, like it's going out of style.
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:13.280]   Like the amount of vets that are questioning
[03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:17.780]   the last 20 years of their life right now is terrifying.
[03:47:17.780 --> 03:47:21.480]   I work with organizations that are doing this outreach
[03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:22.480]   and they're overloaded right now,
[03:47:22.480 --> 03:47:24.160]   like they have never seen before
[03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:27.880]   because this whole thing is just, it's hit head here.
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:31.240]   And so what brass and unity tries to do is
[03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:33.580]   it is really just a vehicle to get the money in the hands
[03:47:33.580 --> 03:47:35.620]   of the people that are doing the work with it.
[03:47:35.620 --> 03:47:37.000]   I couldn't start a nonprofit
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:38.780]   because I'm not good at fundraising.
[03:47:38.780 --> 03:47:40.800]   I'm not good at being like, give me your money,
[03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:42.920]   I'm gonna do this with it.
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:45.280]   The least I could do was come up with a product
[03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:48.600]   that I know I could give to people or people could purchase.
[03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:51.720]   And if I gave pretty much all of the pro,
[03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:56.600]   like the actual profit from it to those organizations
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:00.480]   and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:03.080]   or if they're out and somebody sees a bullet on the wrist,
[03:48:03.080 --> 03:48:04.800]   they go, "Hey, what is that?"
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:07.020]   It's a conversation starter.
[03:48:07.020 --> 03:48:09.040]   And that's exactly what it's been.
[03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:10.800]   And it's done its job as that.
[03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:13.680]   And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle.
[03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:14.520]   We're the vehicle,
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:15.720]   we're the money in the hands of the people.
[03:48:15.720 --> 03:48:18.440]   People don't always wanna just get a tax receipt.
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:20.360]   It's great to donate to something,
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:21.660]   great on you to do that,
[03:48:21.660 --> 03:48:24.320]   but most people have a selfish aspect, right?
[03:48:24.320 --> 03:48:25.320]   And that's okay.
[03:48:25.320 --> 03:48:27.040]   But if you can tap into that,
[03:48:27.040 --> 03:48:29.440]   you can then fund these charities properly
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:32.200]   and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively.
[03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:33.120]   Up until this point,
[03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:36.280]   they just count on people's goodness of their hearts.
[03:48:36.280 --> 03:48:38.860]   Hate to break it to you, humanity is rough right now.
[03:48:38.860 --> 03:48:40.940]   We need to look at something a little differently.
[03:48:40.940 --> 03:48:44.580]   - So these things spark, like jewelry sparks conversations.
[03:48:44.580 --> 03:48:47.140]   And then do you work with charities?
[03:48:47.140 --> 03:48:49.020]   - Yes, oh God, yeah, that's what I do.
[03:48:49.020 --> 03:48:52.020]   So my whole mission every day is I get up,
[03:48:52.020 --> 03:48:55.500]   I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and say,
[03:48:55.500 --> 03:48:57.260]   "But now that you're gonna wear that,
[03:48:57.260 --> 03:48:59.100]   now you're a part of the BNU Army,
[03:48:59.100 --> 03:49:00.820]   now you're a part of this community."
[03:49:00.820 --> 03:49:05.420]   - Speaking of which, let me put it right back on.
[03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:08.220]   Branded, this is a organic product placement.
[03:49:08.220 --> 03:49:10.340]   - Yeah, this isn't like marketing at all,
[03:49:10.340 --> 03:49:12.020]   nothing weird about this at all.
[03:49:12.020 --> 03:49:14.560]   And so we work with a lot of organizations
[03:49:14.560 --> 03:49:17.060]   and I'm very particular about where we send our money
[03:49:17.060 --> 03:49:18.020]   because there are,
[03:49:18.020 --> 03:49:21.460]   it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now.
[03:49:21.460 --> 03:49:25.140]   And if we were able to consolidate, it would be more ideal.
[03:49:25.140 --> 03:49:26.500]   I spoke about that on another show,
[03:49:26.500 --> 03:49:28.020]   but that's not currently happening.
[03:49:28.020 --> 03:49:30.220]   So I try to work with the nonprofits I know,
[03:49:30.220 --> 03:49:32.760]   number one, are not paying six figure salaries,
[03:49:32.760 --> 03:49:35.980]   which trust me, there's lots, a lot.
[03:49:35.980 --> 03:49:38.420]   Number two, I look at the actual resources
[03:49:38.420 --> 03:49:39.280]   that they're providing.
[03:49:39.280 --> 03:49:40.420]   And if they're going to be something
[03:49:40.420 --> 03:49:42.380]   that are gonna be useful, in my opinion,
[03:49:42.380 --> 03:49:43.880]   whether or not they're actually useful,
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:46.400]   and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate.
[03:49:46.400 --> 03:49:47.500]   I know it's worked for me,
[03:49:47.500 --> 03:49:49.380]   so I try to fund the things that I know
[03:49:49.380 --> 03:49:52.580]   have been helpful for me and the people I associate with.
[03:49:52.580 --> 03:49:54.900]   So that's why I brought all the paper
[03:49:54.900 --> 03:49:57.980]   because I didn't wanna be an idiot and forget anybody,
[03:49:57.980 --> 03:50:00.400]   that's really important because I get caught up in things
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:01.580]   and I think it's important to acknowledge.
[03:50:01.580 --> 03:50:04.040]   So number one, Heroic Hearts.
[03:50:05.180 --> 03:50:08.740]   We just started working to talk about them
[03:50:08.740 --> 03:50:10.160]   and really make them known,
[03:50:10.160 --> 03:50:12.260]   but we're gonna be donating to them as well.
[03:50:12.260 --> 03:50:14.860]   - Are they doing more stuff than the Ayahuasca thing?
[03:50:14.860 --> 03:50:17.940]   - Yeah, so their points are, I got Jesse to actually,
[03:50:17.940 --> 03:50:19.260]   I'm like, what are your talking points?
[03:50:19.260 --> 03:50:21.780]   'Cause I need people to know exactly what you do.
[03:50:21.780 --> 03:50:23.620]   So veterans have had to take their mental
[03:50:23.620 --> 03:50:25.120]   and general health into their own hands
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:27.060]   due to the failure of the government system.
[03:50:27.060 --> 03:50:28.980]   So that is why they were created.
[03:50:28.980 --> 03:50:30.700]   But Heroic Hearts is a peer-supported
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:33.480]   mental health network involving full preparation,
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:35.140]   integration, coaching, and connection
[03:50:35.140 --> 03:50:36.540]   to vetted psychedelic treatments.
[03:50:36.540 --> 03:50:38.540]   So they don't just do AYA.
[03:50:38.540 --> 03:50:42.100]   They deal with psilocybin, ketamine, Ibogaine,
[03:50:42.100 --> 03:50:43.920]   but they've got protocols in place,
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:46.900]   they've got locations you go to that are safely vetted
[03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:48.100]   and they work.
[03:50:48.100 --> 03:50:49.940]   They've got over right now,
[03:50:49.940 --> 03:50:51.980]   Jesse said they have over 800 veterans
[03:50:51.980 --> 03:50:53.580]   on a waiting list for treatment.
[03:50:53.580 --> 03:50:56.560]   That's just before the spike of the end of this war.
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:50:59.320]   They have over a hundred,
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:00.980]   they've helped over a hundred veterans,
[03:51:00.980 --> 03:51:03.360]   including dozens of special operation vets,
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:04.900]   find effective care.
[03:51:04.900 --> 03:51:07.700]   They've now got branches in the US, UK, and Canada.
[03:51:07.700 --> 03:51:09.360]   And the biggest thing about them
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:11.620]   and why we talk about them is because
[03:51:11.620 --> 03:51:14.740]   the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it
[03:51:14.740 --> 03:51:17.500]   is so significant, but because of great universities
[03:51:17.500 --> 03:51:20.060]   that are now stepping up and doing the research behind it,
[03:51:20.060 --> 03:51:21.340]   it is being legitimized.
[03:51:21.340 --> 03:51:23.060]   So like they're doing that.
[03:51:23.060 --> 03:51:25.700]   In Canada, there's a group called Theracil.
[03:51:25.700 --> 03:51:27.460]   They are currently fighting the government
[03:51:27.460 --> 03:51:29.300]   to get the rights for Canadians
[03:51:29.300 --> 03:51:31.660]   under section 56 of our laws
[03:51:31.660 --> 03:51:35.020]   to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.
[03:51:35.020 --> 03:51:37.120]   I've done a panel with them on that.
[03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:40.380]   Really great base out of Victoria, really smart people.
[03:51:40.380 --> 03:51:42.580]   One of the other bigger charities that we work with,
[03:51:42.580 --> 03:51:44.020]   and they're honestly,
[03:51:44.020 --> 03:51:45.560]   they were my first and foremost charity
[03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:46.440]   that I ever worked with.
[03:51:46.440 --> 03:51:48.380]   And they're a big component
[03:51:48.380 --> 03:51:50.980]   in the veteran community in Canada.
[03:51:50.980 --> 03:51:52.320]   They're called Honor House.
[03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:57.320]   And Honor House was started by honorary Colonel Al DeGenova.
[03:51:57.320 --> 03:52:00.060]   It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.
[03:52:00.060 --> 03:52:02.740]   He was a Canadian soldier who deployed
[03:52:02.740 --> 03:52:04.940]   and he was, so Captain Trevor Green,
[03:52:04.940 --> 03:52:08.100]   sorry, Trevor, Captain Trevor Green.
[03:52:08.100 --> 03:52:10.460]   He got an ax in the middle of his head.
[03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:12.740]   A Taliban member came up and put an ax directly
[03:52:12.740 --> 03:52:15.860]   into his head when his helmet was off and he survived.
[03:52:15.860 --> 03:52:19.320]   He's done work with Invictus Games and Prince Harry.
[03:52:19.320 --> 03:52:21.940]   He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.
[03:52:21.940 --> 03:52:23.260]   He's so cool.
[03:52:23.260 --> 03:52:26.620]   He hasn't changed one bit from like the infantry captain
[03:52:26.620 --> 03:52:28.940]   you expect him to be.
[03:52:28.940 --> 03:52:32.100]   And Al saw there was a need for vets
[03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:34.540]   and first responders to get treatment
[03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:37.540]   because there's no real home away from home for people.
[03:52:37.540 --> 03:52:40.420]   Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families.
[03:52:40.420 --> 03:52:42.460]   This is vets and first responders.
[03:52:42.460 --> 03:52:44.680]   And so their whole thing, and I'll read it.
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:45.740]   So I said exactly right.
[03:52:45.740 --> 03:52:47.220]   'Cause I used to be on the board of their charity,
[03:52:47.220 --> 03:52:48.380]   but I ran out of time.
[03:52:48.380 --> 03:52:50.020]   So now I just consult.
[03:52:50.020 --> 03:52:52.420]   But they are a home away from home
[03:52:52.420 --> 03:52:54.940]   for members of the Canadian Armed Forces,
[03:52:54.940 --> 03:52:57.080]   veterans and first responders and their families
[03:52:57.080 --> 03:52:59.720]   to stay completely free of charge
[03:52:59.720 --> 03:53:01.700]   while they're receiving medical care and treatment
[03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:03.540]   in the Vancouver area.
[03:53:03.540 --> 03:53:06.380]   But since then they've expanded, since I've come on board
[03:53:06.380 --> 03:53:10.020]   and they've opened Honor Ranch, which is up in Ashcroft, BC.
[03:53:10.020 --> 03:53:13.980]   And it's 140 acres, 10 cabins and a main cabin.
[03:53:13.980 --> 03:53:16.460]   They do equine therapy and they're more focused
[03:53:16.460 --> 03:53:18.080]   on operational stress injury clinics.
[03:53:18.080 --> 03:53:20.580]   So sorry, operational stress injury
[03:53:20.580 --> 03:53:22.260]   within the veteran community.
[03:53:22.260 --> 03:53:24.180]   And they have specialists that do that.
[03:53:24.180 --> 03:53:27.040]   They have their own bracelet with us.
[03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:28.640]   So every time you buy an Honor House bracelet,
[03:53:28.640 --> 03:53:30.240]   all the proceeds go to them.
[03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:33.680]   They, yeah, and it's actually the green one.
[03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:35.280]   So that one, so when you buy one
[03:53:35.280 --> 03:53:37.940]   of those Honor House bracelets, they have those,
[03:53:37.940 --> 03:53:41.120]   they go directly to them, which is really amazing.
[03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:44.440]   They've been near and dear to my heart for a long time.
[03:53:44.440 --> 03:53:46.480]   You've got the All Secure Foundation,
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:49.160]   which is, these guys are super dope.
[03:53:49.160 --> 03:53:50.880]   I'm gonna read exactly 'cause Jen texts me.
[03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:54.160]   So Jen and Tom Satterly, I've had them both on the podcast.
[03:53:54.580 --> 03:53:56.420]   Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.
[03:53:56.420 --> 03:54:00.260]   Tom is a Delta, have you heard of them?
[03:54:00.260 --> 03:54:01.940]   - Black, what? - No, of--
[03:54:01.940 --> 03:54:03.300]   - No, no.
[03:54:03.300 --> 03:54:05.140]   - So, okay, so Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.
[03:54:05.140 --> 03:54:06.980]   It was one of his first operations.
[03:54:06.980 --> 03:54:08.280]   He's a Delta operator.
[03:54:08.280 --> 03:54:09.460]   And I asked her, I said, "Listen,
[03:54:09.460 --> 03:54:10.460]   "I'm gonna be doing these shows
[03:54:10.460 --> 03:54:12.140]   "and I think it's great that we talk about you more."
[03:54:12.140 --> 03:54:15.420]   So I said, "Give me your three points of importance."
[03:54:15.420 --> 03:54:17.380]   So the All Secure Foundation
[03:54:17.380 --> 03:54:19.600]   serves special operations combat families
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:21.540]   in healing from post-traumatic stress injury
[03:54:21.540 --> 03:54:23.340]   and secondary post-traumatic stress.
[03:54:23.340 --> 03:54:25.560]   So that's often what the wife or the other husband
[03:54:25.560 --> 03:54:27.940]   or the other spouse suffers from.
[03:54:27.940 --> 03:54:28.820]   And we're starting to see that
[03:54:28.820 --> 03:54:31.180]   be more and more of an issue now.
[03:54:31.180 --> 03:54:33.140]   So they also are devoted to rebuilding
[03:54:33.140 --> 03:54:35.060]   the couple's relationships on the home front
[03:54:35.060 --> 03:54:36.580]   after the separations of war.
[03:54:36.580 --> 03:54:40.060]   And 80% of their warriors went on, went,
[03:54:40.060 --> 03:54:44.140]   yeah, 80% of their warriors want their families
[03:54:44.140 --> 03:54:45.200]   to be more involved with the healing.
[03:54:45.200 --> 03:54:47.880]   The problem is, is very often,
[03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:49.800]   vets don't realize that they can have,
[03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:52.380]   or just because the system doesn't pay for it,
[03:54:52.380 --> 03:54:54.580]   actually have their spouse as a part of things.
[03:54:54.580 --> 03:54:55.860]   And the biggest thing that we find
[03:54:55.860 --> 03:54:57.180]   with special operations families,
[03:54:57.180 --> 03:54:59.260]   I think the divorce rate's like 95%.
[03:54:59.260 --> 03:55:00.340]   - Wow.
[03:55:00.340 --> 03:55:03.380]   - And so they work so hard with these families.
[03:55:03.380 --> 03:55:05.340]   They take them on retreats, these husband and wives,
[03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:06.560]   and they get them to connect again
[03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:09.600]   after being separated over such a long period of time.
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:11.840]   There's other places like Children of Fallen Patriots
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:14.820]   out of DC, where they fund education,
[03:55:14.820 --> 03:55:17.940]   university for people who have lost their parents
[03:55:17.940 --> 03:55:21.340]   in deployments, whether their kid's even born yet.
[03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:23.060]   If they're still in utero, they still pay.
[03:55:23.060 --> 03:55:24.520]   They do not care.
[03:55:24.520 --> 03:55:26.820]   Then you've got people like in Canada,
[03:55:26.820 --> 03:55:28.560]   you've got Vets Canada.
[03:55:28.560 --> 03:55:32.020]   You've got, in the States, you've got True Patriot Love.
[03:55:32.020 --> 03:55:35.920]   You've got, who else in the States is really great
[03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:36.920]   that we've worked with?
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:39.100]   I know there's a Green Beret Foundation, that's great.
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:41.220]   One More Wave gives amputees,
[03:55:41.220 --> 03:55:43.860]   teaches them to surf with amputees.
[03:55:43.860 --> 03:55:45.140]   Like, they're really great.
[03:55:45.140 --> 03:55:46.900]   There's so many organizations,
[03:55:46.900 --> 03:55:50.620]   but at the end of the day, I focus on a small subset
[03:55:50.620 --> 03:55:54.220]   because you cannot fix everyone's problems.
[03:55:54.220 --> 03:55:57.960]   The least thing, the least you can do for people is focus.
[03:55:57.960 --> 03:55:59.420]   If you can provide focus,
[03:55:59.420 --> 03:56:01.220]   you can provide the proper amount of funding.
[03:56:01.220 --> 03:56:03.580]   Proper amount of funding can get the proper amount of tools.
[03:56:03.580 --> 03:56:06.720]   Those tools can actually be implemented properly.
[03:56:06.720 --> 03:56:08.260]   And then those people can go on
[03:56:08.260 --> 03:56:11.660]   to hopefully have successful marriages and families.
[03:56:11.660 --> 03:56:13.460]   And we don't have to watch our parents
[03:56:13.460 --> 03:56:14.460]   drink themselves to death
[03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:16.740]   and wonder why daddy's yelling at mommy all the time
[03:56:16.740 --> 03:56:18.500]   and daddy storms out and leaves.
[03:56:18.500 --> 03:56:20.260]   Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life
[03:56:20.260 --> 03:56:21.700]   and mommy had some shit happen,
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:24.180]   but that does not mean that's who they are.
[03:56:24.180 --> 03:56:28.300]   - And yeah, so trauma has completely destructive effects
[03:56:28.300 --> 03:56:30.700]   on family and relationships
[03:56:30.700 --> 03:56:34.660]   and correcting that as ripple effects.
[03:56:34.660 --> 03:56:38.140]   - Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.
[03:56:38.140 --> 03:56:40.860]   Because the problem is we are so quick
[03:56:40.860 --> 03:56:44.040]   to tell people they're suffering from PTSD.
[03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:45.760]   We're so quick to give them drugs.
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:48.320]   We're so quick to kick them out of the military.
[03:56:48.320 --> 03:56:50.280]   We're so quick to let them be homeless on the street.
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:52.280]   We're so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:56:53.200]   We're so quick.
[03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:55.880]   And then all of a sudden when a politician goes,
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:56:58.780]   veteran suicide's an issue, that's when it's a problem.
[03:56:58.780 --> 03:57:00.120]   Well, if you prevent the problem
[03:57:00.120 --> 03:57:01.440]   from happening in the first place,
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:03.120]   or you give people the right funding and tools
[03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:05.460]   to do the job, you won't have this problem.
[03:57:05.460 --> 03:57:10.320]   - Do you have advice for young people?
[03:57:10.320 --> 03:57:14.560]   Think high school students, maybe undergrads,
[03:57:14.560 --> 03:57:18.080]   college students about career, life,
[03:57:18.080 --> 03:57:20.080]   how to live a life they can be proud of.
[03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:22.760]   You've had one heck of a life.
[03:57:22.760 --> 03:57:27.960]   - Some of them are really cheesy, but they're true.
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:32.600]   Live a life you can be proud of, number one.
[03:57:32.600 --> 03:57:34.520]   If you wake up every morning and you hate what you do,
[03:57:34.520 --> 03:57:37.540]   change the fucking station.
[03:57:37.540 --> 03:57:41.360]   Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.
[03:57:41.360 --> 03:57:42.440]   It's not worth it.
[03:57:42.440 --> 03:57:45.840]   It's not what you're on this planet for.
[03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:48.480]   You're worth more than that, than the monotony
[03:57:48.480 --> 03:57:50.960]   of waking up, going to work, hating your life,
[03:57:50.960 --> 03:57:54.120]   drinking yourself to sleep, and functioning.
[03:57:54.120 --> 03:57:55.160]   Do yourself a favor.
[03:57:55.160 --> 03:57:57.320]   The thing I scream about on the show so much
[03:57:57.320 --> 03:58:00.300]   is move your fucking body.
[03:58:00.300 --> 03:58:02.540]   Move your body.
[03:58:02.540 --> 03:58:04.200]   Get your blood moving.
[03:58:04.200 --> 03:58:07.400]   Allow your body to do what it's here for.
[03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:09.200]   Go for a run, go for a walk.
[03:58:09.200 --> 03:58:11.320]   If you can't run, walk to the fridge
[03:58:11.320 --> 03:58:13.600]   three times more than maybe you did before,
[03:58:13.600 --> 03:58:15.380]   but you're moving.
[03:58:15.380 --> 03:58:18.440]   Pay attention to the shit you look at.
[03:58:18.440 --> 03:58:23.160]   More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:27.140]   just be force-fed information from one side or the other,
[03:58:27.140 --> 03:58:28.560]   and none of it makes sense.
[03:58:28.560 --> 03:58:29.820]   None of it's understandable.
[03:58:29.820 --> 03:58:32.500]   It just causes chaos in the brain.
[03:58:32.500 --> 03:58:36.520]   Really pay attention to what you listen to.
[03:58:36.520 --> 03:58:41.520]   Something I've had to learn to do is make time for myself.
[03:58:41.520 --> 03:58:45.160]   All of this working 18 hours a day,
[03:58:45.160 --> 03:58:47.240]   not sleeping, just work, work, work, work.
[03:58:47.240 --> 03:58:48.080]   That doesn't work.
[03:58:48.080 --> 03:58:48.940]   That's not sustainable.
[03:58:48.940 --> 03:58:49.780]   It's not healthy,
[03:58:49.780 --> 03:58:52.180]   and it's not anything anyone should be doing.
[03:58:52.180 --> 03:58:53.820]   Balance is important,
[03:58:53.820 --> 03:58:57.820]   but if you're going to take the time
[03:58:57.820 --> 03:58:59.820]   to do something for yourself,
[03:58:59.820 --> 03:59:02.180]   don't make it sitting in front of the TV for six hours,
[03:59:02.180 --> 03:59:04.980]   eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.
[03:59:04.980 --> 03:59:06.940]   Make it, I'm gonna go for a walk,
[03:59:06.940 --> 03:59:09.720]   maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.
[03:59:09.720 --> 03:59:12.540]   Make it, I'm gonna go volunteer somewhere.
[03:59:12.540 --> 03:59:13.580]   Nobody does that anymore,
[03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:15.220]   but make it I can go volunteer somewhere.
[03:59:15.220 --> 03:59:18.140]   Honor House, they have no paid employees.
[03:59:18.140 --> 03:59:19.020]   They have one.
[03:59:19.020 --> 03:59:20.500]   Everybody is a volunteer.
[03:59:20.500 --> 03:59:23.020]   They're fucking phenomenal.
[03:59:23.020 --> 03:59:25.980]   Just do whatever you're gonna do.
[03:59:25.980 --> 03:59:27.860]   Do it with some fucking drive.
[03:59:27.860 --> 03:59:30.500]   Put some goddamn effort into your life,
[03:59:30.500 --> 03:59:32.140]   and pick something in a career
[03:59:32.140 --> 03:59:34.300]   that's gonna make you happy,
[03:59:34.300 --> 03:59:36.260]   not something that's just gonna give you six figures,
[03:59:36.260 --> 03:59:37.460]   'cause that's not gonna make you happy.
[03:59:37.460 --> 03:59:40.380]   I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world,
[03:59:40.380 --> 03:59:42.340]   and the last thing I want is more things.
[03:59:42.340 --> 03:59:43.180]   I want less.
[03:59:43.180 --> 03:59:45.700]   I want the woods, and I want quiet,
[03:59:45.700 --> 03:59:48.180]   because that's what's important to me.
[03:59:48.180 --> 03:59:50.420]   I want my family to matter,
[03:59:50.420 --> 03:59:52.100]   the people around me to matter,
[03:59:52.100 --> 03:59:55.820]   and the small group I keep, that tight knit I have,
[03:59:55.820 --> 03:59:57.580]   I want them to wake up every minute
[03:59:57.580 --> 03:59:58.700]   knowing that they have a friend
[03:59:58.700 --> 03:59:59.860]   that they can call on the other line
[03:59:59.860 --> 04:00:01.820]   that isn't just like, how's it going,
[04:00:01.820 --> 04:00:04.260]   that can actually have a conversation,
[04:00:04.260 --> 04:00:08.560]   a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.
[04:00:08.560 --> 04:00:12.660]   We are just breeding these kids to be followers
[04:00:12.660 --> 04:00:16.560]   who digest bullshit, who reverberate things
[04:00:16.560 --> 04:00:19.880]   they don't fully understand, and have opinions on stuff
[04:00:19.880 --> 04:00:21.680]   they have no business talking about.
[04:00:21.680 --> 04:00:25.900]   - Yeah, with an open mind, humbly,
[04:00:25.900 --> 04:00:28.140]   think deeply about the world.
[04:00:28.140 --> 04:00:28.980]   - Correct.
[04:00:28.980 --> 04:00:32.660]   - How has your relationship with death changed?
[04:00:32.660 --> 04:00:36.020]   This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.
[04:00:36.020 --> 04:00:38.580]   So you've considered suicide throughout your life.
[04:00:38.580 --> 04:00:41.020]   You have been in the line of fire.
[04:00:41.020 --> 04:00:42.980]   You have witnessed death.
[04:00:42.980 --> 04:00:45.380]   You as a human being, a mortal one,
[04:00:45.380 --> 04:00:49.740]   do you think about your death these days,
[04:00:49.740 --> 04:00:52.420]   now that you have begun the journey
[04:00:52.420 --> 04:00:55.340]   with dealing with your trauma?
[04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:57.900]   Do you think about your death?
[04:00:57.900 --> 04:00:59.460]   Are you afraid of your death?
[04:00:59.460 --> 04:01:03.140]   - Well, you don't die, so that's why.
[04:01:03.140 --> 04:01:05.340]   - What do you mean, you don't die?
[04:01:05.340 --> 04:01:06.860]   - You move on.
[04:01:06.860 --> 04:01:08.660]   - Where do you go?
[04:01:08.660 --> 04:01:10.940]   - To another plane, and another vibration,
[04:01:10.940 --> 04:01:14.260]   and another whatever you wanna call it, this isn't it.
[04:01:14.260 --> 04:01:15.940]   This isn't all of it.
[04:01:15.940 --> 04:01:17.340]   This is a blip.
[04:01:17.340 --> 04:01:19.740]   This is a moment, this is a...
[04:01:19.740 --> 04:01:22.820]   I used to be afraid of death before the military.
[04:01:22.820 --> 04:01:24.620]   I was always afraid of dying.
[04:01:24.620 --> 04:01:26.980]   I don't know why, I had this irrational fear
[04:01:26.980 --> 04:01:28.740]   that I was gonna be kidnapped in my room.
[04:01:28.740 --> 04:01:31.460]   Like seriously, like irrational fear, like afraid.
[04:01:31.460 --> 04:01:35.820]   And it's funny, 'cause I talked to Michaela yesterday,
[04:01:35.820 --> 04:01:37.780]   and she said the same thing, and I was like,
[04:01:37.780 --> 04:01:39.740]   oh my God, I know what you're talking about.
[04:01:39.740 --> 04:01:41.180]   - Being afraid of being kidnapped?
[04:01:41.180 --> 04:01:43.460]   - Yeah, she had this fear that someone was gonna come in
[04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:44.900]   and take her out of her room.
[04:01:44.900 --> 04:01:46.980]   I had the same fear.
[04:01:46.980 --> 04:01:49.180]   - By a human being, or a monster of some kind?
[04:01:49.180 --> 04:01:50.460]   - No, I think by a human being,
[04:01:50.460 --> 04:01:52.700]   and I had this irrational fear that I was,
[04:01:52.700 --> 04:01:54.940]   that something was gonna happen to me.
[04:01:54.940 --> 04:01:56.300]   And like I said, I don't know if it's because
[04:01:56.300 --> 04:01:58.540]   my parents were always made me aware of my surroundings.
[04:01:58.540 --> 04:02:01.420]   People take people, this is a real thing that happens.
[04:02:01.420 --> 04:02:03.820]   And I was really small, and I looked like a little boy.
[04:02:03.820 --> 04:02:06.220]   My hair was like that when I was training.
[04:02:06.220 --> 04:02:08.700]   I had short, no hair, I had flat as a board.
[04:02:08.700 --> 04:02:10.860]   You would've thought I was a 12-year-old boy.
[04:02:10.860 --> 04:02:12.900]   And so my mom's like, people take people, sweetie,
[04:02:12.900 --> 04:02:14.780]   that's just the reality of life.
[04:02:14.780 --> 04:02:15.620]   You need to be aware.
[04:02:15.620 --> 04:02:18.100]   So I don't know if I had this ingrained in my mind.
[04:02:18.100 --> 04:02:20.500]   I was always training to protect myself,
[04:02:20.500 --> 04:02:23.300]   or fight someone off, so I was afraid
[04:02:23.300 --> 04:02:25.220]   of this irrational thing.
[04:02:25.220 --> 04:02:27.380]   And then I went overseas, and then I realized
[04:02:27.380 --> 04:02:28.940]   that I could just be literally there talking to you,
[04:02:28.940 --> 04:02:30.260]   having a conversation, and I could just be
[04:02:30.260 --> 04:02:32.140]   taken off the face of the earth.
[04:02:32.140 --> 04:02:34.660]   And there's nothing I can do about it.
[04:02:34.660 --> 04:02:36.820]   And then I adapted this idea that when it's my time,
[04:02:36.820 --> 04:02:40.140]   it'll be my time, but the difference is now,
[04:02:40.140 --> 04:02:46.740]   at least I know that if I do go,
[04:02:46.740 --> 04:02:51.460]   and I do cross, and I do move on,
[04:02:51.460 --> 04:02:56.180]   I know that I live my life the way
[04:02:56.180 --> 04:02:59.840]   that I always hoped I would be proud to live.
[04:02:59.840 --> 04:03:04.340]   - Can I ask you a dark question?
[04:03:04.340 --> 04:03:05.180]   - Yeah.
[04:03:05.420 --> 04:03:07.500]   - You mentioned Robin Williams,
[04:03:07.500 --> 04:03:09.460]   you mentioned Anthony Bourdain,
[04:03:09.460 --> 04:03:12.100]   and your own struggle with suicide.
[04:03:12.100 --> 04:03:17.100]   Why do you think they ultimately lost that battle?
[04:03:17.100 --> 04:03:19.340]   Why do you think they lost their lives?
[04:03:19.340 --> 04:03:21.580]   - Man, that's a loaded question,
[04:03:21.580 --> 04:03:22.940]   because you could look at everything
[04:03:22.940 --> 04:03:27.260]   from biomarkers in the brain to know
[04:03:27.260 --> 04:03:29.140]   if their serotonin and dopamine levels
[04:03:29.140 --> 04:03:30.700]   were crashed in the ground.
[04:03:30.700 --> 04:03:34.340]   There's biological reasonings for some people
[04:03:34.340 --> 04:03:36.380]   where they're born bipolar and they have,
[04:03:36.380 --> 04:03:37.380]   or they're schizophrenic.
[04:03:37.380 --> 04:03:42.380]   There's so many things we don't fully grasp about the brain.
[04:03:42.380 --> 04:03:47.220]   But what we do know from my perspective, for me at least,
[04:03:47.220 --> 04:03:53.060]   there really is no rhyme or reason
[04:03:53.060 --> 04:03:55.120]   why I survived and others didn't.
[04:03:55.120 --> 04:03:59.140]   Stuff and things don't make you happy.
[04:03:59.140 --> 04:04:03.180]   People don't always know why they're feeling
[04:04:03.180 --> 04:04:06.700]   the way they're feeling, but they also are not always
[04:04:06.700 --> 04:04:13.860]   willing to talk about it or be,
[04:04:13.860 --> 04:04:15.060]   they put on a good front.
[04:04:15.060 --> 04:04:18.300]   And if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?
[04:04:18.300 --> 04:04:21.200]   - And it's especially clear with the two of them
[04:04:21.200 --> 04:04:24.980]   that on the surface they're exceptionally successful
[04:04:24.980 --> 04:04:26.460]   in so many dimensions.
[04:04:26.460 --> 04:04:28.700]   And still that means nothing.
[04:04:28.700 --> 04:04:32.500]   Material possessions, anything really,
[04:04:32.500 --> 04:04:36.580]   is not, doesn't guarantee you happiness.
[04:04:36.580 --> 04:04:37.660]   - No, it doesn't.
[04:04:37.660 --> 04:04:40.080]   - Well-- - That's scary.
[04:04:40.080 --> 04:04:42.040]   - That's terrifying.
[04:04:42.040 --> 04:04:46.860]   But when it's good, that's what makes it joyful.
[04:04:46.860 --> 04:04:51.020]   Like that's what happiness is.
[04:04:51.020 --> 04:04:54.580]   It's like, holy shit, somehow amidst all the absurdity,
[04:04:54.580 --> 04:04:56.860]   all the things that you can't predict,
[04:04:56.860 --> 04:04:58.940]   you nevertheless feel really good.
[04:04:58.940 --> 04:05:00.380]   That's why I feel really fortunate
[04:05:00.940 --> 04:05:03.840]   to be getting this feed of happiness all the time.
[04:05:03.840 --> 04:05:09.900]   Well, to be or not to be, that's a good place to end it.
[04:05:09.900 --> 04:05:13.280]   Kelsey, you're an amazing human being.
[04:05:13.280 --> 04:05:15.220]   I'm really fortunate that you would spend
[04:05:15.220 --> 04:05:16.580]   your valuable time with me.
[04:05:16.580 --> 04:05:22.260]   As I said, you're so good at not just talking,
[04:05:22.260 --> 04:05:25.860]   but listening, so I definitely will listen to your podcast.
[04:05:25.860 --> 04:05:27.980]   'Cause I can tell you're an incredible person
[04:05:27.980 --> 04:05:30.860]   as an interviewer and as a storyteller.
[04:05:30.860 --> 04:05:33.580]   So again, thank you for talking today.
[04:05:33.580 --> 04:05:34.860]   - Thank you so much, Bob.
[04:05:34.860 --> 04:05:37.940]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[04:05:37.940 --> 04:05:39.260]   with Kelsey Sharon.

[04:05:45.340 --> 04:05:46.580]   from Herbert Hoover.
[04:05:46.580 --> 04:05:49.980]   Older men declare war,
[04:05:49.980 --> 04:05:53.220]   but it is the youth that must fight and die.
[04:05:53.220 --> 04:05:57.340]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[04:05:57.340 --> 04:05:59.920]   (upbeat music)
[04:05:59.920 --> 04:06:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[04:06:02.500 --> 04:06:12.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
