[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   reading from verse 10 to verse 13.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Put on the whole armor of God,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   but against principalities, against powers,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Wherefore, take unto you the whole armor of God,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and having done all, to stand."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Now we are engaged at the moment in a study of this phrase,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   this particular phrase, about the wiles of the devil.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And we are concerned about that as it is applied to,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   or manifested to the individual Christian.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   We've already looked at it in general,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   as it has been manifested in the life of the church as a whole.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   But now we are concerned about the devils that attacks upon us
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   as individual Christians and believers.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The matter is confined, obviously, to believers.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We have left the realm long ago of the more general activities of the devil and his powers.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Here the apostle deals particularly with Christian people.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And we've seen that he attacks us in the realm of the mind,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and the understanding that he does so likewise in the realm of the experience,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   the experimental part of our Christian life,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and also with regard to our practice and conduct.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Now, just at the moment, we are looking at the wiles of the devil
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   as they are exercised upon the experimental or experiential aspect
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   of the Christian's life in this world.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We've seen that he tries to confuse us.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That's always his method.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That is the devil's great weapon, confusion.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He confuses our understanding.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   It's the thing that's most evident in the church, I think, at the present time,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   speaking generally, how the devil is confusing the understanding of Christian people.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But he does this also in the realm of experience.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And we've been looking at aspects of this.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We've seen how he tries to confuse us,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   even as to the place of experience at all in the Christian life.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And then how he tries to muddle us with regard to the place of feelings,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   the sensibilities, that aspect of the Christian life and experience.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And then last Sunday morning, we were looking at a very difficult
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   and involved exercise of the wiles of the devil,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and he tries to confuse us as to the realms of the physical and the psychological and the spiritual.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And gets us into terrible confusion, making us regard that which is physical and psychological
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   sometimes as if it were spiritual, and then doing the exact opposite,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   trying to persuade us to explain away that which is primarily and purely spiritual
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   in terms of the physical or the psychological.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Well, you see, it's a large realm, and his works and efforts and wiles
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   are almost endless in the variety of their manifestations.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That is why the apostle gives this solemn warning.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "Were it not that he can tell us, and tell us with confidence,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   that we can be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   were it not that there is a whole armour of God available for us,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   our position would be completely hopeless.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There's no man who could ever confront and stand up to the wiles of the devil.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But it's possible for us, for he says, having done all things, to stand."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now that's the kind of thing we're dealing with, and we move forward this morning
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   to the consideration of another aspect of the way in which the devil exercises his wiles
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   with respect to our experience.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And that is, troubles in connection with assurance of salvation.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Here again is a most prolific subject.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And we shall find as we examine it that the wiles are manifested in exactly the same way.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   The devil has only one method, and that is always to produce confusion.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And he does that, as we've seen, by driving us from one extreme to another.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Now hold on to his method. It's most important to realise this.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   The greatest of all dangers in the Christian life is to swing from one extreme to another.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That is the way the devil always tries to delude us.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Having seen the dangers on one side, we overcorrect,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and are then in quite as bad a case because we've gone too far in the other direction.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Well now, we'll see this as we come to consider this whole aspect of the devil's attack upon
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   our assurance of salvation.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Now let's look at it like this.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   We are all meant to have assurance of salvation as Christian people.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   There's nothing in a way about our salvation which is more remarkable and more wonderful than this.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God has not only provided a way whereby we can be saved,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   he not only does save us, but he lets us know that he's done it.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And I say this is a very glorious and wonderful aspect of the Christian life.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The Christian is not meant to remain in doubt and in uncertainty.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Why no, there are sections of the Church that teach that.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   When we were looking at the Roman Catholic Church a few months back,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   we saw that the Roman Catholic Church deliberately discourages the doctrine of assurance.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Obviously she must do so, because if she didn't do that, there wouldn't be such place for the priesthood.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   There wouldn't be such place for the power of the Church and the power of the authorities.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   She deliberately keeps people in uncertainty about their condition in this life and in the next,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   so that you have to go to your priest and confess, you need your indulgences, you pray for the dead, and so on and so forth.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But, as we indicated, that's a gross and terrible violation of the New Testament teaching.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   The New Testament teaching, in a sense, is more concerned about this great matter of assurance than it is about anything else.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   That's the theme of so many of these epistles.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Take, as just one example, John's first epistle, chapter 5 and verse 13.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   We are meant to know it. We are meant to have assurance.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   We are meant to be certain, and for obvious reasons.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   We are meant to be able to pray with confidence and with assurance.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   The prayer of the Christian believer is not meant to be something uncertain.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   He is not vaguely seeking and groping after God.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Take the great epistle to the Hebrews, and you will find that one of its greatest themes is just this matter of assurance in prayer.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   "Let us therefore," he says in chapter 4, verse 16, "let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Boldly, with confidence, with assurance, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And then he says it again in the 10th chapter, in verse 19.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It is a very important statement. Listen to it.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and having an eye-priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   That is the way to pray.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The Christian is meant to pray with confidence, with full assurance of faith.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   He is a child going to his father, not uncertainly, not hesitantly,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   but with this boldness, with this great assurance and confidence.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And, in addition, he is meant to know peace and he is meant to know joy.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Take again that first epistle of John.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   At the very beginning, in the first chapter, in verse 4, he says these things right way unto you,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "That you a joy may be full."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Here is the old man, the old apostle, at the end of his very long life, writing,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   knowing that he is dying, and looking at these Christian people who are left behind,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   he says, "I am writing to you that you may have fellowship with us."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And our fellowship, indeed, is with the Father and with his Son,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   but not only that you may have this fellowship, but that your joy may be full.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Even in a world like this, their joy is meant to be full.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And you notice the apostle Paul, in writing to the Philippians, says the same thing,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   "Rejoice in the Lord always." And again I say, "Rejoice!"
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That is meant to be the position of Christian people.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Not only saved, but knowing that we are saved, realizing it and rejoicing in it
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Well, very well.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   As this is the case, it is not surprising that the devil pays particular attention
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   to this aspect of the Christian's experience.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And I suppose it is true to say in many ways that anyone who has any pastoral experience
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   will know and will agree with me when I say that a greater number of problems arises
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   just at this point than perhaps in any other connection.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   The devil has a wonderful field here, and he makes full use of it in the exercise of his wiles.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And that is why so much, as I say, of the New Testament is devoted to this particular question.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   These men were anxious that these Christian people should be enjoying the fruits of this great salvation.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   All along the Christians were tending to be in trouble, and they needed these exhortations,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   these great displays of doctrine, the exhortations and so on.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   They are all designed just to give people the joy of salvation, the assurance,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   peace and joy and happiness in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Very well.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   The space given to all this in the New Testament is proof positive in and of itself
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   of the wiles of the devil in this respect.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   He began immediately trying to rob people of this glorious aspect of our great salvation.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Very well.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   We have great material, therefore, in the New Testament itself.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Do you require help in addition?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Well, it can be helpful.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And that is the purpose of preaching, and that is the purpose of writing,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   in order to expound the Scriptures, to draw out the teaching.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And there are certain books which deal with this in a very excellent and in a very helpful manner.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I suppose the greatest book ever written on this particular matter
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   is the book by Jonathan Edwards, the great American divine of two hundred years ago,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   a book called A Treatise on the Religious Affections,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   which I am glad to remind you has just been reprinted,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and I would commend everybody to read it.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   It is the most masterly analysis of the true and the false in this matter of peace and assurance
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   that has ever been written.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It is incomparable.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   There are others.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   One of the old Puritans of three hundred years ago, Richard Sibbes,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   who was known, as he preached here in London, as the heavenly Dr. Sibbes.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And they called him the heavenly Dr. Sibbes not only because he seemed to have an unusual knowledge
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   of the glories that await us, but he was such a wonderful physician of the soul.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   He wrote a book called A Soul's Conflict.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Unfortunately this is out of print, but if you can get a copy of it or borrow it, I commend you to do so.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   It has been a healing balm to many a distressed soul, the soul's conflict.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Indeed, those Puritans were masters at this very subject.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   As I was saying last Sunday morning, they were always applying these cordials, these balms,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   to the wounded, the grieved soul.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Sibbes has another one called the bruised reed.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   It is all the same.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   They are all designed to comfort and to strengthen God's people.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   So there is ample material for your consideration.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Well now, how does the devil deal with us in this matter?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   How does he exercise his wild...
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   In connection with this whole question of assurance,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   the first thing he does is to try to give us a false assurance,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   to give us a false rest, a false peace and a false joy.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now there, you see, you get at once an illustration of his wildness and his craftiness.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Obviously, if he can delude any of us with the counterfeit,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   he is going to keep the true from us.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And that is one of his favorite wilds.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   He comes to the Christian and he offers him something which appears to be on the surface
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   the true Christian peace and joy and happiness and rest,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   but which turns out on closer analysis in the light of the Scriptures
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   and in experience itself, unfortunately, eventually,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   to be nothing but a horrid counterfeit, something false and spurious.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   How does he do this?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, it is a very subtle matter.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   What is the kind of thing about which I am speaking?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Well, let me give you an example out of the Scriptures.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   It puts it very perfectly.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Listen to this in the book of Revelation, chapter 3.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Here it is about the church of the Laodiceans.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   "These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   the beginning of the creation of God.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot;
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I would thou wert cold or hot.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   So then, because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I will spew thee out of my mouth,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and of need of nothing.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and poor and blind and naked."
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Now, there it is.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   You can't better that description of a church or a body of Christian people
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   who have succumbed to the wiles of the devil in this particular respect.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Perfectly self-satisfied, rich, everything going well,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   needing nothing at all, and yet in a terrible and tragic condition.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   There are other illustrations.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   There is no doubt at all that the church at Corinth
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   was very subject to this particular thing also.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   For instance, the apostle addressing them in the first epistle in chapter 5
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   says something like this at the very beginning.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   "He is dealing with a terrible sin.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and such fornication is not so much as named among the Gentiles
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   that one should have his father's wife, and ye have puffed up,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   might be taken away from among you."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   They were puffed up in spite of this.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Everything was all right.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   There was no trouble, there was no bother at all.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   A false peace, a false rest, a false state of joy.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And you get a hint of the same thing in the second epistle to the Corinthians
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   in the last chapter in verse 5, where he urges them to examine themselves,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   to prove their own selves, whether they are in the faith or not.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Obviously the apostle wouldn't have used such language
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   unless he had grave reasons for thinking that there was something
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   seriously wrong with the life of that church.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   What is the cause of this?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Here is a state, you see, in which a Christian believer,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   a professor of the Christian faith,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   is of the opinion that all is well.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Seems to have a great and a perfect and a wonderful assurance.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Nothing at all wrong.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   What's the cause of this?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Well, it is caused undoubtedly.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Its chief cause, Adenerate, I suggest, is this.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   That somehow or another they've been ushered into the Christian life
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   too hurriedly, too precipitately.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   This condition is commonest in people whose conversion has been forced.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   It's the result of a kind of intellectual ascent to truth
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   without knowing the power of the truth.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   There is that type of evangelism which gets people to say,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   "Here it is, this is what the scripture says. Are you prepared to say that?"
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   "Very well, then you're a Christian, all is well."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Now there is a sense in which one knows what that means,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   but there is another sense in which it can be the greatest of all dangers.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   The mere repetition of statements and of formulae
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   does not of necessity prove that we are Christians.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The devils believe but also tremble.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   The New Testament is full of this.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   There were people in the church who had said the right thing.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Take John again in this first epistle.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   "There are certain people," he says, "who have gone out from among us."
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And he says, "By going out from us they are giving proof positive
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   that they were never really of us."
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   But you see, they'd been in the church,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and they would never have been accepted in the early church
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   which was very careful about these matters
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   unless they'd subscribed to the truth.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   They'd agreed with all the statements,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   and yet they'd gone out proving, says John,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   that they were never really of us at all.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   But they gave every appearance of being right.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   All their statements were correct.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They seemed to be perfectly orthodox,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   and for a while they seemed to rejoice in it.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   There it is then, not to mention the early verses
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   in the sixth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   where you've got people saying the right things,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   tasting of the heavenly gift and so on,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   and the powers of the world to come,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   and yet showing quite clearly that they'd never been regenerate.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But they gave it the appearance of being.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Well, now there is the very danger with which we are dealing.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And undoubtedly, I say, the most prolific cause of this
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   is that men and women are hurried and forced to say things
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   before they really do possess them
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   and before they become a part of them.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Very well, let us then look at the characteristics
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   of this dangerous condition in order that we may avoid it.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   What is wrong with such a person?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Well, the first thing is, as I said,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   that there has really been no change,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   no radical change in the life.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   There's no new life.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   There has been a modification of the old life,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   but that isn't what a Christian is.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   A Christian is not a man who has modified his own life.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   He's a man who is born again.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He's got new life.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   There is a new principle in him.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   There is this new dynamic,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   this new disposition placed there by the Spirit of God.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   That's what makes a man a Christian.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Now, that's, you see, where the danger comes in.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   That can be counterfeited.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It can be simulated.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You can have a kind of artifact
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   which looks remarkably like the real thing itself,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   as an artificial flower sometimes is almost indistinguishable
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   from a living flower.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   A man, for some reason or another, may have become unhappy in his life,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and his conscience is worrying him.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   He comes across the Christian message,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   and he adopts it,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and he puts a curb upon all that is wrong in him,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   and he conforms to a new pattern and a new way of life.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   He's doing it all.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   He's doing it by an effort of the will,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   and it can be done. There's nothing to stop that.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   That's how moral men live.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   They use their willpower. They use their understanding.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   A man can modify his life so much and to such an extent
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   that looking at it casually, you'd say,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   "Well, that man is an unusually fine Christian."
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   And yet, you see, the teaching is that the man may not be a Christian at all.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   What's the difference?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Well, I say it is this difference
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   of having a principle of life within you at the center
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   which controls everything,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and in addition to what you have,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   and a modification of what you are on the surface,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   and on the surface only.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It's a very difficult and a very subtle matter.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, but we are dealing with the wilds of the devil, obviously.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   He is, of all the manufacturer of artificial products,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   the chief, and the greatest artist, and the greatest expert.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And he has caused endless confusion in the church
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   throughout the centuries by doing this very thing,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and he has confused the individual in the same way.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   The vital question we ask ourselves, therefore, is this.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Am I aware of something entirely new within me?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Am I aware of being controlled and mastered
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   by something, someone, not myself?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Can I say in any degree,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me"?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Am I aware of the other that is in me,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and the life I now live in the flesh?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I live by the faith of the Son of God,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   who loved me and who gave himself for me.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Are you aware, I ask, of the fact that something has been done to you,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   not that you have done something,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   not that you have been modifying what you wear,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   or what you had, or what you have.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   No, no. Are you aware, I say, that down in the depths of your being,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   God has done something and has put something into you?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Can you say, "We are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus"?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Can you say, "I am an epistle of Christ"?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "I am an epistle of Christ, written not with ink,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   not in the fleshy tables of the heart,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   but written by the Holy Spirit." That's it.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   This is the one differentiating point,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and if a man is honest with himself, he is able to tell the difference.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   There, then, is one thing. Let me give another test.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   The trouble, the difficulty about the false and the spurious is this,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   that it's never troubled about itself in any way,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   like those people in Laodicea.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Full, rich, everything.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Never unhappy about itself at all,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   never having any question about itself,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   never disturbed about itself.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   That's a very important test, that.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   The devil always makes one blunder.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   It's not always the blunder made by the forger,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   or by the manufacturer of the counterfeit.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   He overdoes it. He overdoes it.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   He's so anxious, you see, to do it well, he overdoes it.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And this is the way in which he does it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   The kind of person who has been rushed into a false conversion,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   and who has got a false peace and a false joy,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   never has any problems or difficulties at all.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And they can't understand all this.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I was reading last Sunday that hymn of William Cowper,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   "Where is the blessedness I knew?"
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   This is all foreign to them. This is ridiculous.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And they don't understand why people should ever have written these books,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   like "The Soul's Conflict" and "The Treatise on the Religious Affection"
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and some of Bunyan's works.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   They don't understand that.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   They've never had the problem that poor pilgrims had in pilgrims' progress.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   They say, "From the moment I believed, I've never had any trouble."
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   They've never been aware of any difficulty.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   They've never been troubled about a consciousness of a sinful nature.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   They don't know what it is to feel that there is another law in their member's dragon.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   They've got no troubles at all.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   They're never in difficulty about themselves.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Now that's the most alarming sign then.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   There's nothing more alarming.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   This kind of euphoria, as it's called, perhaps in medical terms,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   there are certain diseases which give a kind of euphoria.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   The person not only doesn't know that he's ill, he feels remarkably well.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   That's the characteristic of some diseases.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   It's certainly the characteristic of this spiritual disease.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   They're remarkably happy and well, never felt so well,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   never were things so good, never any trouble at all.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You see, they're very unlike the Apostle Paul and the writers of the New Testament,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   who were aware of things within them in the body, the law in the members.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   The Apostle Paul has to keep under his body,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but these people never have any trouble like that.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   They don't know what this means at all.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's all been wonderful ever since they believed.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   You see, it's a contrast not only to the teaching,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   but to the experiences of God's saints throughout the centuries,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   who've had great troubles like this in their fight against the world, the flesh and the devil.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   That's a very good and a subtle test, therefore.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And another manifestation, the third, is this.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   It follows from all I've been saying.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   These people always have a great dislike of self-examination.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   They're always preaching against self-examination.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   They say, "You mustn't do that. That's looking in.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   You're only going to make yourself miserable."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   They say, "Look to the Lord. Look out. Don't look in at all.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Never examine yourself in any way."
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Now, a violent objection to self-examination
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   is always a very sure indication that it's the false and the spurious.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Because the New Testament is full of exhortations to us to examine ourselves,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   to prove our own selves, to make certain of this.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   You read the New Testament, it's there everywhere.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   We are being warned against the false, false spirits, false apostles,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and this falseness that is in ourselves.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   But these people don't like that because, and it's obvious, isn't it,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   they have a feeling that if they do start examining themselves,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   they're going to be made miserable.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's like a man who's ill. He says he won't go and see his doctor.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   "No, no," he says, "if I go to the doctor, he'll tell me to stay in bed,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   or he'll suggest an operation, so he won't go to his doctor."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   He's trying to persuade himself that all is well,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   what art of folly it is, in every realm.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   But there it is. It happens very often in the spiritual realm.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   In other words, I say,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   the trouble about this kind of person is that he or she is always too healthy.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   The whole thing is overdone.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   No difficulties, no problems, no doubts.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   What are all these morbid people talking about,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   in writing their books and dealing with these possibilities?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They don't understand it. The thing is nonsense.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   There's something wrong with them. They're not healthy-minded.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   If you're saying that, my friend,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   you are contradicting the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   You're in a very different state and condition from the Apostle Paul,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   who says in this tabernacle, "We do groan, being burdened,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house, which is from heaven."
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Well, let me go on to the next test, which is this,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   a form of antinomianism, which means this,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   that the life of these people doesn't correspond to their great claim.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   They claim to be rejoicing in this salvation.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   No troubles, no problems, peace, joy, all is well.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Well, I think you're entitled to expect an unusual
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and a most remarkable kind of living and of department and of behavior.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   If people are in this relationship to God,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   that there are no difficulties or problems,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   well, I think you expect to find in them
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   unusually shining and glorious examples of self-control and of discipline.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   They will be models in every respect of what the Christian men ought to be.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But you will generally find that these people are the opposite.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   There are obvious glaring defects in their lives.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   They don't correspond to what they claim to be.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   In other words, let me put it this way,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   the false is always lacking in the true marks and the characteristics of the true.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   What are they? Here they are positive.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   The man who has a true peace and a true joy and a real assurance
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   is never glib.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   He is never light-hearted. Never.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   You read your New Testament.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   There was no man possibly who had a greater assurance of salvation than the apostle Paul.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Is he ever glib? Is he ever light-hearted?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Can you even imagine his being frivolous?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Can you imagine him saying these things with a swagger?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Never.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Indeed, in his epistles, when he writes even to young men like Timothy and Titus,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   he says that even the young men are to be grave,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that they are to be sober, that they are to be serious.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And of course the thing is so obvious.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   What we are dealing with is so great and glorious.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   It's our relationship to God.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   A man who is glib in his talk about God
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   is virtually telling you that he knows nothing about God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   It's when a man is away from God and doesn't know him
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   that he talks glibly and lightly and loosely.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Poor Job fell into that trap.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   But you see, when he came back to God,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   the first thing he does is to put his hand upon his mouth.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   "I spoke foolishly," he said.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And his wife had spoken still more foolishly.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   The ignorant woman, she didn't know what she was talking about.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Very well, there is never any glibness or light-heartedness
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   about the true Christian who has the real and the genuine assurance.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Well, in other words, the second point is this.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   The true is always filled with a sense of wonder
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   and of amazement and of surprise.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   In other words, the true Christian doesn't say, "Of course I'm saved."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   The true Christian says, "Well, it's an amazing thing that I should be saved at all.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   How did the Almighty God ever come and bring himself to look upon me?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I, says this Paul, am the least of the apostles of them
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   that are not worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of Christ.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Last of all, he manifested himself unto me."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   This is the argument.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   The Son of God who loved me, even me, and gave himself for me.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   He can't get over this.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   He's amazed at it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   He's astonished at it.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And anybody who realizes something of what it means
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   must be filled with this same astonishment.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   You see, there's none of this light-heartedness.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I'm saved at all is well.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   The astounding thing has happened.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That the great and eternal and almighty God in his holiness
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   should ever have been able to forgive me.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Died he for me who caused his pain?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   For me who him to death pursued?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Amazing love, and can it be that thou, my God, hast died for me?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   When I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   my richest gain I count but loss, and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Wonder and amazement, my friends.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And if in your peace and joy and rest there isn't this element of astonishment
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and amazement that you are given this,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   I say again, examine yourselves.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Look at the very foundation.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   In other words, the next characteristic always is humility.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Humility.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Oh, what a neglected grace is this grace of humility.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Of course, we are living in an age which believes in the cult of personality.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Self-confidence, assurance.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   It's the antithesis of the New Testament.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Blessed are the meek, says this.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   They are the people who are blessed.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And our Lord himself, the lowly Jesus.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   The bruised reed he will not break.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The smoking flax he will not quench.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Look at him, son of God.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   He humbled himself.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Humility.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And see it in these, his followers.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Look at it in these mighty men with their genius, their flaming intellects,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   their wonderful understanding.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Look at it in this apostle Paul.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Look at it in all of them.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Look at them in the lives of the saints of the centuries.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And you will find all the churches are agreed about this.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   The Church of Rome included.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   There is no greater mark of the true saint than humility.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   So if there isn't this element about our peace and our joy,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   if it's characterized by a kind of boastfulness and self-confidence and glibness,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   it's not the genuine thing, my friend.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It's the horrible counterfeit, this artificial thing that the devil makes and invents.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Well, let me give you a final test of the truth.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It is this, of course.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It is not like the Laodiceans resting upon your own, self-satisfied.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   You've got nothing to do but to maintain what you are.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's this.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   for they shall be filled."
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   You see, the more a man has, the more he realizes what he hasn't got,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   and the more he desires to have.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   This is always the hallmark of the true Christian,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   a sense of dissatisfaction with what he is.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   He's not satisfied.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   He always wants more.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Well, let me give you this classic account of it once more
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   from the writing of the great apostle.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   If ever there was a man in the Christian church
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   who had a right to be satisfied with himself,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I imagine it was the apostle Paul.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   In understanding, in knowledge, in ability to expound,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   in experiences that had been given to him.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Yet he speaks like this,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   but this one thing I do,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   forgetting those things which are behind
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   and reaching forth, stretching forth like a dog at the leech,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   and to those things which are before.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   That's the characteristic of the true saint.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   He's not self-satisfied and content and resting on it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Oh, he says, "I thank God for what he's given me, for what I've got.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But I can see the vast ocean spreading away endlessly beyond horizons
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   that I can't even imagine, and I'm but a little child peddling on the edge."
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And he wants to press on and to press forward.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Oh, he says, "This is my ambition, that I may know him
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   being made conformable unto his death.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   That's it, not that I have already attained, but I follow after
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   and always pressing toward the mark and going on,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   conscious of deficiencies and unworthiness,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   realizing how much more there is to possess."
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   But you see, the people with the false peace,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   they know nothing about this.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Their belief is that really there's nothing to be added.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   They've got everything. They've arrived.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Isn't it obvious that this is nothing but the horrible, ugly, foul
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   counterfeit of the evil one?
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Very well, then, I say, there is the first thing that the devil tries to do.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   He tries to keep us from a true assurance and a real peace and joy and rest
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   by offering us and giving us the counterfeit.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And of course, as long as we've got it, we won't seek anything at all.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   The Laodiceans were not.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   That's why the apostle has to speak to them in such strong language
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   as the messenger of Christ.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   "I counsel thee. I urge upon you. I plead with you.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Do it at once. You've got to buy this gold.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   You've got to find new raiment.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   You're all together wrong. You have no idea of your condition.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I urge you. I counsel you."
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Let's leave it at that.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   That is the very beginning of this matter.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   What else does he do about this?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Well, the next way to look at it, of course, is this.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   The devil, having tried to keep us into this state of quiescence,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   into this drugged condition by giving us the counterfeit,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   when he's failed in that respect, he hasn't finished.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   He now changes his tactics completely.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Here it is, you see.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   That extreme, this extreme.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   He doesn't care. He'll change his coat.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He'll change his color. He's a chameleon.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   He can appear as an angel of light.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   He'll appear as anything in order that he may bring down God's people,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   the wiles of the devil.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And now, having failed there, he turns right over.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And what does he do here?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Ah, now, this is the point at which he begins to appear
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   as the accuser of the brethren,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   as our adversary, the devil.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   You see, he first of all tries to make us think we're wonderful Christians and all is well.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Then, having failed there, he comes right round and says, "You're not a Christian at all."
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   He'll sift you. He'll try you. He'll examine you.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   He who before discouraged you from self-examination, he'll now begin to examine you.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And he'll force upon you a self-examination that will be so terrible
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   that you'll doubt whether you've ever been a Christian at all.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   He'll shake you. He'll try to bring you right down.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   He'll try to move the foundation that's under your feet.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   He is the accuser of the brethren. He's the adversary.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Now, we are going to consider this.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   We don't do so this morning. Obviously, there's no time.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   All I want to say about it this morning is just this.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   This is the great principle.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   There is one thing, thank God, the devil cannot do.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And that is, he cannot rob us of our salvation.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   He cannot do that. That's an utter impossibility.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   We are in the hands of God. We are his workmanship.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   No man shall be able to pluck us out of his hands.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Now, let's be clear about this, because if we are not clear there,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   well, we are already defeated by the devil.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   The devil can never rob anybody of his salvation.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   If he could, he'd do so.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   There would be nobody saved if the devil had that power.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   The devil is the strong man armed, as our Lord says.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   You remember in that figure that he uses in Luke 11 and elsewhere.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He is the strong man armed, and he keepeth his goods at peace,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   and they can't get out of his clutches.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   But, a stronger than he cometh, and robs him of his armor wherein he trusted,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   and sets the goods at liberty.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   If that were not true, there'd never have been a Christian.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   There would be no such thing as a single saved, redeemed person.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   We all of us have to be taken out of the clutches of the devil.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   The Lord Jesus Christ has done that.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And the devil can never get us back.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   If he could, we'd all go back.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   But he can't.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   Now, the apostle John, you remember, is very explicit about this.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And it's a most comforting thought in that first epistle, chapter 5, towards the end.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Listen to this in verse 18.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not."
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   He doesn't go on sinning.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He doesn't remain in the realm and the territory and the dominion of sin.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   "But he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   He can't clutch at him. He can't hold him.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   "Toucheth him not. We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the wicked one."
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Now, here is the comfort, I say, the final comfort.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This is a part of the whole armour of God.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   The devil can never rob us of our salvation. Never.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   But he can rob us of the joy of salvation.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   He can rob us of the happiness of salvation.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   He can rob us of the peace that accompanies salvation.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   He can take from us the rest that is meant to be the portion of the people of God.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   And it is there that he exercises all his ingenuity and manifests his subtle wiles.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   He knows he can't get us back.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Well, then there's only one thing. The next best thing is this.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   "All right. They belong to him and not to me."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Well, what I'll do now, then, is to make them miserable. I'll make them wretched.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I'll try and rob him of the joy of what he's done to them.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   So he brings out his wiles.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And that's this great theme, I say, which is dealt with so extensively in the New Testament
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   and in these other books I've been writing, that I've been referring to.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   My friends, let me put it like this to you.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   If you're in any doubt as to the wiles of the devil in this respect,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   are you enjoying the assurance of salvation this morning?
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Can you say of yourself what the apostle Peter says of those unknown first Christians in the first century?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   "Whom having not seen, ye love. In whom, though now ye see him not yet believing,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory."
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Is that true of you?
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   You see, Peter wasn't writing about himself there.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   He wasn't writing about the other apostles.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   He was writing about unnamed Christians, strangers scattered abroad.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   He didn't know their names, he knew nothing about them.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   All he knew was that they were Christians.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   And because they're Christians, that's true.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Is it true of us?
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Is our joy full, as John says it should be and as it might be?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   If it isn't, it is because of the wiles of the devil.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   You can be a Christian and yet lack assurance.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   You're saved, but you may not know it because of the wiles of the devil.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   He can rob you of the joy, the happiness of it all,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   and the power of it all, as it were, as a result of that.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   He can't rob you of the salvation.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   But oh, how often has he brought people into a state of misery as if they were not Christians at all,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   by his horrible wiles.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Very well, that is what we are going to consider together.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   How he exercises these wiles in order to confuse us and to bring us into a state of muddle.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   He examines us and shakes the very foundation, as it were.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   He can't really shake the foundation, but he gives the appearance of doing it.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Now then, that's the theme we are going on to consider.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   How he implies these subtleties and wiles just at that point,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   to rob us of the joy of the salvation which he cannot touch.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   God willing, we'll proceed with this next Sunday morning.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
