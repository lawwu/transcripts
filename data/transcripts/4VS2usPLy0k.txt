[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   "What is note-taking for?
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.800]   I found note-taking most useful in the short term, grounding me in my current task or noting
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.640]   a few to-dos throughout the day.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.560]   Almost all of them are immediately disposable.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.120]   It seems like note-taking can become fairly navel-gazing and doing it excessively takes
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.040]   away from execution."
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.080]   It's a good question because we see this a lot in our discussions of organization.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.960]   Notes and note-taking is an excessively broad term.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.320]   It covers lots of different things and for a lot of people, like Mark, these things get
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.000]   all mixed up and they're thinking, "Well, I don't know.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.720]   I'm sitting here journaling all day.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.720]   Is this note-taking?
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720]   What should I be doing?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   What should I not be doing?"
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.800]   So what I want to do here is step back.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.440]   Let's give a general definition for note-taking and then I want to highlight what I think
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.560]   the three critical types of note-taking systems you need in your life if you work any sort
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.000]   of knowledge job.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.160]   From there, move on to talk about more advanced options.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.520]   So let's define note-taking more generally to mean recording information on a durable
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.360]   written medium.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   So anywhere you're collecting information in a written medium that's durable, you have
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.680]   it outside of your head so you can reference it later.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.320]   Here are the three types of this note-taking that I think are critical, especially for
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   most knowledge workers.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.240]   One, some sort of working memory extender.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.760]   This is where I use my text file on my desktop of my computer's workingmemory.txt.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.160]   This is for strictly expanding the amount of information you can temporarily hold on
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.000]   to as you engage with the inflow of information throughout your workday.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.320]   So as things come in, you're in a meeting and people are suggesting next steps, you
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.440]   can just write this information down in whatever medium you use for your working memory extender
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   because it's probably more information you can keep in your head.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.160]   So there it is.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   I write it down right there.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.960]   Or I'm going through my email inbox and I need to remember different notes I need to
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.880]   act on, schedule this, get back to them.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.120]   I can write it into my workingmemory.extender.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.420]   These are notes that exist outside of your own brain, allows you to hold on and organize
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.920]   more information than you could do just strictly within the confines of your own neurons.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.960]   Now this is something that resets all the time.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.540]   It's a durable form, but you reset it all the time.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.080]   So as I'm going through a meeting, I'm taking quick notes on here's the five things I need
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.480]   to do.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.620]   After that meeting, those notes will then get processed out of my working memory file
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.600]   into calendar reminders, into my obligation system.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.700]   So it's a temporary storage, but it allows me in the moment to keep track of more things
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.140]   that my brain can do on its own.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.460]   That's note taking, but of a very temporary type.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.760]   Next comes what I just cited, which is your obligation tracker.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.340]   Some system to maintain all of the relevant information for every obligation on your plate.
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.380]   This is also note taking, written durable information that you don't have to keep track
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.700]   of in your head.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.960]   So somewhere here, all the things I have to do probably categorized.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.180]   Here is all of the information related to each of these things, all in this one place.
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.920]   You want that information accessible and captured somewhere, that's note taking.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.940]   Then finally we get to what most people think of when they think about note taking, and
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.700]   this is more where you're capturing key ideas about your work and your life.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.780]   It could be interesting ideas, interesting articles, brainstorms, concerns that you have.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.300]   This is the broad category that captures what people normally think about in note taking.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.140]   I might be journaling my thoughts about things.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.020]   I might be writing down my plans for how I want to improve my life.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.100]   I might be capturing articles that are relevant to the newsletter that I run and things I
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.780]   want to remember.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.780]   This is where you're going to use whatever type of system you like to capture things
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.780]   in.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.380]   You have a lot of different choices here.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.120]   All three of these things are note taking.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.900]   You need some sort of system for each.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.420]   In my own life, I use a plain text file for working memory.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.820]   I use Trello for obligation tracking notes, one board per role, one column per type of
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.720]   obligation, one card per obligation, all of the relevant information for that obligation
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.540]   on the card.
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.860]   I use my Remarkable 2 digital notebook for everything else.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.500]   Inside my Remarkable 2, I have dozens of different individual virtual notebooks for keeping track
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.700]   of ideas, reflections, concerns, etc.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.100]   So those are the three categories, Mark.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.340]   Do those three categories, different tools for each, different rates of refresh and reset
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.660]   for each working memory.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.980]   You're resetting this every 10 minutes or so.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.620]   Your obligation list, you're working with every day.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.420]   Your bigger idea capture is something you maybe go over in detail much less often.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.380]   "Hey, I'm going to have a summit now to rethink this part of my business.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.740]   Let me go back and look through my notes."
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.460]   Maybe that's just once every few months or so.
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.980]   That's really it.
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.100]   There are more complicated systems and methodologies.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.060]   We have a lot of fans here of Zettelkasten type systems.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.460]   We also have a lot of fans here of interesting note-taking software that really gets into
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.060]   the details of how you store notes, how you connect notes, the format in which the notes
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.820]   are stored.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.260]   That is optional.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.740]   It's more about your interest.
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.460]   If you like information management as a hobby, you can build more complicated systems around
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.320]   it, but you don't need complicated systems to successfully take notes.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.020]   Those are the three areas you have to take notes.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.020]   Just make sure those are all three covered with some sort of reasonable techno system,
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.020]   and then you're doing a fine job.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.860]   I think that separation is key.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.440]   Don't mix all this stuff together.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.420]   Don't have a moleskin somewhere in which you're trying to keep your tasks next to your vision
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.380]   for living on a cabin in 20 years next to a grocery list you want to remember when you
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.380]   go to the store.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.660]   We need some separation for note-taking to keep up with the complexity of modern life.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.660]   All right.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.700]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.900]   Next question is from Reeshab.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.060]   As a 26-year-old software developer who has recently landed a well-paying job, I'm looking
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.140]   to pursue my interest in learning to play the guitar, drawing, and some days gardening.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.540]   However, I'm concerned about whether it's feasible to schedule all these activities
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.340]   into a single week while maintaining a focus on deep life core fundamentals.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.740]   Your expert opinion, would it be possible to balance all these pursuits effectively
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.540]   within a given week without compromising on essential life habits?
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.260]   Well, I think this is a objective question for which you can get an objective answer
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.060]   by becoming quantitative.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   Let's just work with your calendar.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.700]   I'm assuming you're professionally speaking, you're organized, you time block your days,
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.700]   you have a clear shutdown.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.260]   So there's some clarity about your time outside of work.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.640]   Play with that time.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.700]   So start autopilot scheduling some of these hobbies.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.140]   Maybe you garden on weekday mornings.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:17.100]   Maybe you alternate a guitar practice session and what was the other thing, drawing practice
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.420]   session on different days.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.720]   You do it an hour before dinner.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.900]   Work with this out.
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   See if it fits.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.380]   And if the stuff does fit, execute this autopilot schedule for a while and say, does this feel
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.020]   sustainable or do I feel like I'm constantly running from one thing to another or it's
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.820]   overfilling my time?
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.420]   I used to run this exercise with undergraduates who are trying to figure out their academic
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.860]   programs, their extracurricular programs, and I would say, we got to sit down and just
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.380]   build a plan for your proposal here.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.060]   You want to do these five extracurriculars and double major?
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   Show me the time.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.780]   Then they would go through and block off the time for studying and how long is this going
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.060]   to take and put on their meetings and the time to work on their activities.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.880]   And it either fit or it didn't.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.980]   And sometimes if it just barely fit, they would come back a week later and say, this
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.100]   is crazy.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.400]   Every minute of my life is scheduled.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.820]   So if it doesn't fit or it fits and your life feels too crowded, then you just pull back.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.660]   You're getting an objective feedback here.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.660]   You pull back.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.300]   And it doesn't matter if you're pulling back.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.700]   These are hobbies.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.660]   The thing is, you want to be spending quality time outside of work on things that matter.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.060]   The quantity isn't important.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.220]   So if it doesn't fit or it barely fits, maybe you do seasonal pursuits.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.340]   In the spring, I'm working a lot on my garden and in the winter, I'm spending a lot more
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.620]   time on guitar because that's sort of inside.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.060]   And I do drawing in the fall.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.460]   You could have seasonal pursuits, you could stack these one over another, or maybe what
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.740]   you need to do is just slow down your ambition for these pursuits.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.900]   And instead of saying, look, I'm going to do four hours of guitar a day and I want to
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.500]   be shredding in like six months, you say, I'm going to spend less time.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.660]   Good hard practice, like we talked about the deep dive, trying to move up the stair steps
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.340]   towards expert knowledge, but I'm just willing for this to take longer.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.980]   A few years from now, I'll be a pretty good guitar player, but I'm playing just an hour
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.980]   every other day.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.180]   That doesn't take up as much time.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.580]   I'm doing so I have a drawing class I take once a week and on Fridays I get out of work
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.420]   early and go to a park to work on the drawing.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.260]   This is maybe I'm going to learn these skills slower, but that makes their footprint on
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.940]   my schedule smaller and I have more give and more flexibility and don't feel like I'm over
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:25.940]   scheduled.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.540]   So treat this like a quantitative question.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.140]   Get clear feedback.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.380]   If it's too much, reduce or slow down.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.940]   It doesn't really matter for your goal here, which is just to make sure that you're engaged
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.860]   in deeper pursuits.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.180]   That's what matters, not the speed at which you're getting better at things, not the quantity
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.300]   of things that you're actually going after.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.260]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.780]   Next question is from Craig.
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.340]   I'm a college student trying to be more smart about how I study and organize my learning.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.340]   I'm relatively new to this stuff.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.980]   Strangely, most productivity tips on YouTube are about the top 10 to do lists and note
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:03.980]   taking apps.
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.220]   Will I be less effective if I don't use one of those apps?
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.900]   It seems like a lot of work and setup to learn all those apps to be efficient and I dread
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.340]   thinking about the heavy lifting prep those apps require.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.340]   What should I do?
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.900]   Well, I think my answer here at first is going to be ironic because you may be listening
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.900]   to this answer on YouTube, but I'm going to tell you in a second why what I'm about to
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.380]   say here is not oxymoronic.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.780]   Don't use YouTube to get advice on studying.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:38.380]   So when you're getting information, especially information on improving your life, you have
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.620]   to understand the incentive structures in place.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:50.100]   And for people who are purely doing YouTube, so if you're a pure study habits YouTuber,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.300]   the incentive structure is for views.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.300]   That's what you look about.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   That's what you care about.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.780]   I want more views on my videos.
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:04.260]   To get more views on your videos on YouTube, you have to work with the idiosyncratic properties
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.580]   of the recommendation algorithm and you get into this feedback loop where you, your, your
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:17.060]   content, it morphs more and more towards what's giving you this better feedback from the algorithm.
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.940]   And after a while is the algorithm specifying your contents.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.420]   You may be started out as a YouTuber saying, I want to help students study better because
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.500]   this is an audience out there that cares about this.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.820]   And after six months of interacting with the algorithm, it's, you know, the top 10 to-do
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:38.640]   list apps or whatever, because this is what's getting them the best view numbers.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.180]   The advice might have very little to do, however, with the nuts and bolts of becoming a better
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.180]   student.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.300]   So the incentive structure matters.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.540]   So if you want to become a better student, and this is going to sound very self-serving,
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.820]   but I'm going to say, read my book, how to become a straight A student.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.900]   So why is that better?
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.780]   Because what is the incentive structure of books?
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.820]   When you write a book, like how to become a straight A student, let me tell you this
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.540]   from experience.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.660]   This is not a, we're going to go hard out of the gate.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.980]   There's going to be a number one New York times bestseller.
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.480]   I'm going to be on the today show talking about this book and every major podcaster
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.760]   wants to have me on.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   That is not the play.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.460]   When you write a book on student advice, the play is this better work.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.140]   So some people will buy this because they heard about it from me or saw it on a table.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.140]   I'm embarrassed to admit this Jesse, but when that book came out, it was for my first, my
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.660]   first year of grad school at MIT, I would sometimes go to the Harvard co-op as they
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.140]   call it the coop.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.620]   And I would, uh, it was on tables, kind of hang around.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.740]   People would pick up the book and look at it, but that's like how people discovered
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.740]   it at first.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.860]   I didn't have a social, there was no social media back then, wasn't on a big podcast.
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.660]   People would find it on tables and then it's all word of mouth.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.900]   And what is going to make someone recommend a book to someone else?
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.780]   This worked, this made me get better grades.
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   You should read it.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.980]   My kid's grades got better after they read this.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.940]   So what you want to look for, if you want to align incentive structures with advice
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:13.860]   here is where you want to find a book on student study habit advice that just had a quiet entry
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.540]   into the marketplace and over time sell, sell, sell, sells.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.460]   And I just looked it up before the show.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.880]   I think the sales, um, on how to concentrate a student is approaching 250,000 copies.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.180]   A book that has never had any major promotion has never been talked about on a single major
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.940]   podcast show or had any footprint on social media.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.420]   That's all word of mouth.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.580]   So there you verify the incentive there for me to make that book, sell that many copies.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.500]   I was obsessed about this better work.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.220]   What really works.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:49.740]   So books have a better incentive structure surrounding their information than YouTube
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.740]   does.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.860]   So you buy my book or any other book that has sold a lot of copies that focus on this
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   topic.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.220]   You're much more likely to get advice that works and you're not going to hear anything
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.340]   about note taking apps or to do list in that book.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.980]   My book gets right down to the brass tacks of what are the different academic tasks you
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.540]   have to do?
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.780]   What is the right way to do these?
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.620]   How do you take information from a textbook and learn it efficiently to the point that
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.020]   you can do well on a test?
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.180]   How do you write a paper?
[00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.700]   How do you break that down into multiple steps so that it's a good paper that you're going
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.900]   to get good grades on?
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.820]   How do you learn mathematics to the level that you can sit down for a mathematics exam
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.260]   and get a really good score on it?
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.660]   Well, here's exactly how you want to organize your notes.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.600]   Here's how you should study it.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.260]   These would make excessively boring YouTube videos from the perspective of the algorithm,
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.060]   but they also lead to notably high GPAs.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.860]   All right, so now let's come back to the oxymoronic fallacy early on.
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.100]   Aren't you hearing advice now on YouTube?
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:52.020]   Well, here's how I exempt what we're doing here is that if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.220]   what you are seeing is the video of a podcast, right?
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.500]   The podcast is the game here.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.740]   We put the video of the podcast on YouTube.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.420]   Podcasting has a good incentive structure.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.260]   It's similar to books.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.060]   There is not an algorithm to please.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:14.780]   In other words, there's not a hard, inscrutable, complex feedback mechanism that drives your
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.220]   content in podcasting.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.020]   It is just like books.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.260]   If someone likes your show, they will tell someone else about it and your audience grows
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.780]   a little bit.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:30.220]   And that's how podcasts grow is people find what you're talking about to be effective
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.360]   enough that they will then go on to tell someone else about it.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.080]   So that's what I think saves us here if you're watching this on YouTube, is that what we're
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.280]   trying to do is get more podcast listeners.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.300]   And I see that the exact same way as trying to get more book readers.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.840]   The stuff's got to work.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.640]   We play some tricks with the thumbnails and the titles to try to get some algorithmic
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.080]   juice.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.540]   Our YouTube guy does that.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.300]   But the content comes out of the podcast.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.140]   So I think incentive structures matter, so keep that in mind.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:08.420]   So peer YouTubers are not necessarily a great source of advice on a lot of topics.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.440]   You want to find sources of advice where the incentive structure is for the advice to work.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:19.120]   That's what's going to make it actually do better.
