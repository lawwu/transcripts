[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.220]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.140]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.020]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.220]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.820]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.740]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.300]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.640]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.120]   this homeschooling possibility or deep
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.460]   into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.880]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.760]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.120]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.860]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.160]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.460]   to this episode of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.600]   We are gonna talk today about juggling acts.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.240]   Now, I don't mean at the circus,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.280]   I mean the kind of juggling acts
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.000]   that we homeschool parents do every day.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We are juggling our own lives, our own families,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.960]   the health of our family, the wellbeing of our family,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.980]   our housework, sometimes a part-time job,
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.720]   all of the education of our kids,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.340]   our spouse may be working full-time outside of the home.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.480]   You might feel like a juggler,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.500]   but what if you have a bunch of children
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140]   that you're trying to homeschool?
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.600]   I remember years ago, my friend Lee looking at me
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.480]   and saying, "Oh, you just have two girls.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.920]   You have a hobby family."
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.720]   And I was slightly offended.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.240]   I didn't feel like it was a hobby.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.920]   I felt like they were really my vocation.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.720]   But what she meant is that there are additional challenges
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.200]   that face moms and dads
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.120]   who are juggling multiple students at home.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.280]   And I know that that is the case for some of you,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.960]   and we don't want to ignore that.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.760]   We don't want to ignore the fact that,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.640]   yeah, you may have a kid in foundations
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.440]   and one or two in foundations and essentials
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.720]   and some challenge kids as well.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.500]   And what's a mom and dad to do?
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   So I brought with me a dear friend, Denise McClain,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.600]   who is a mom of six,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.480]   a very experienced classical educator.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.760]   And she's gonna give us all the answers
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.040]   to the juggling act that is our life.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.240]   See, she's laughing.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280]   Denise, thank you.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.740]   Thank you for being with us today.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.440]   - I'm so glad to be here, Lisa.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.320]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.040]   - This is gonna be a great, enriching conversation.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.880]   Every time I talk to you, Denise,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000]   I gain a little nugget of wisdom.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.920]   And lots of times I write it down and I think on it
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.960]   after we get off the call together.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.520]   So I know that you are gonna bless the moms and dads
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.720]   who are listening today,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.160]   who just want to, all of us, learn from one another.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.880]   And so you have had some experiences
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.120]   as a longtime homeschool mom
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.880]   that are gonna benefit some of us.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.480]   So let me ask you this.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   How long have you been homeschooling
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.320]   and tell us about those six kids?
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.640]   - Oh, sure.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.000]   The drum roll, we've been going for,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.760]   since 2003 is how long we've been homeschooling.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.080]   Yes, my babies. - That's awesome.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.640]   - My first baby showed up then and she came out
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   and we already had lesson plans.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.480]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   Okay, I love it.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.560]   You are counting from the birth of your child.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400]   - Oh yeah.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.320]   - Not from where, that's so cool though.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.680]   You're not counting from where most people
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.280]   out in the quote unquote real world
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.120]   would start talking about schooling.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.880]   So you homeschooled from the birth of your child.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.720]   I love it.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.040]   - We did.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   I had the benefit of, my husband and I decided
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.120]   before we had kids
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.000]   that we wanted to classically educate our children.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.560]   And then eventually we figured out,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.240]   well, we're gonna do that through homeschooling.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   - Gotcha.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.960]   - And so it was interesting to me that I went into it
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880]   having this whole notion.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.080]   First time mom, all the bells and whistles
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.480]   that go along with that.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.800]   And a mother-in-law that was super complacent
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.160]   in all of that.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.720]   She enabled me quite a bit
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.560]   to help me accomplish those desires and dreams
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.760]   to just start out strong in setting up children
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.400]   who love God and love to learn,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.640]   love to be with their family.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.760]   - Oh Denise, that's so beautiful.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.120]   - Enjoyed that.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.200]   - I love that.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.840]   So you have six kids.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.200]   Tell us about your family.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.920]   - All right, so my eldest has graduated
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.440]   from Classical Conversations a few years back
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.320]   and she's 21 and newly engaged.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.640]   So we're excited about that.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.320]   Yes, and my second born graduated a year ago.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.080]   She's 19.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.360]   And then we have a 16 year old girl,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.000]   a 14 year old, a 12 year old, and a nine year old.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200]   - Wow. - All girls.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.040]   - All girls. - Just keep going
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   with the girls.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   - Six girls. - All the girls.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.520]   - We're gonna have some good conversation, I can tell.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.360]   - Yes.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.720]   - That's awesome.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   So it sounds like you've got not just a big family,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.600]   but a spread out family.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.360]   So you were still Foundations and Essentials
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.600]   when you had challenge kiddos too.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   - Oh, yes.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.280]   Yeah, we have been doing a stint
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.040]   in Foundations and Essentials for quite some time.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.000]   And we've only just seen the light at the end of the tunnel
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.240]   because my youngest has begun her first year of Essentials.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.960]   So we've been counting down.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.560]   We did that chart many years ago.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.840]   Like how old will everybody be when your last one starts?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.680]   Yeah, so it's fun.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.520]   We're excited and I'm sad at the same time
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.040]   because we have thoroughly enjoyed our time
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.800]   with Foundations and Essentials
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.840]   and sitting in there all these years,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.240]   10 plus years of being a parent in Essentials.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.720]   I've learned something every single time.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.560]   It's amazing.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.840]   - Do you feel like just when you're beginning
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.960]   to get the hang of it, it's hard to hang it up?
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.640]   - Yes, wait a second.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   Now I think I understand what's going on 10 years later.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.760]   - Yes.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.480]   - Okay, so that is the first nugget of encouragement,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.840]   family, that you keep learning
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   and that don't berate yourself for quote unquote
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.720]   not getting it all right away.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.240]   I mean, Denise is super smart and super dedicated.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.960]   She'd been doing this 10 years and still learned stuff.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   So the encouragement is that you're gonna keep learning
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.920]   alongside of your kids the whole time.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.720]   If you're doing it right, you're still learning.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.400]   You haven't stopped learning yet.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.840]   So you've got a big family of homeschoolers.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.280]   What are some of the blessings
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.360]   of a big family of homeschoolers?
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.080]   And then we'll talk about the challenges,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.640]   but I wanna hear the good stuff first.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.480]   - Well, I laugh at the big family definition
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.920]   because it really depends on what circles you're in.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.640]   I might just be an average size family,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.880]   especially the town that we came from
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.480]   that we raised our girls in the last 15 years,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.600]   the average family size was four.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   So it was higher than the national average overall.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.920]   So it's just funny to me.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.960]   But anyway, it's a great size.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.440]   We've thoroughly enjoyed it.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.240]   Some find it big, especially if you have two.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.560]   It took me six for the Lord to finish his work
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   is what I figured.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.480]   - I know, right?
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.360]   - It took a lot more work for me to-
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.200]   - You know what?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.040]   I'm just curious in his timing.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   - I realized that God did a lot more with me
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.640]   as I homeschooled my children
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.680]   than I feel like I did with them.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.200]   I mean, they came out, they started pretty good
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.520]   and they ended great.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.720]   And I started kind of pitiful and ended pretty good.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.400]   And so I think that's really true.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.840]   The Lord works on us as parents
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.400]   while we are homeschooling our kids.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.360]   So I love that, that it took you six kids
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.200]   to get your rough edges marked off.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.120]   - Yes, yes.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.240]   So it's definitely a grace of the Lord
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.160]   to give us what he has.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.200]   The blessings that we've experienced though is,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.080]   I have to say, it's marked mostly with joy and laughter.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.800]   That is what we have hoped to have in our home.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.440]   And I'm so thankful to be able to say all these years
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.880]   that we have been able to maintain that joy,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.640]   that sheer desire to just enjoy being with one another
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.800]   and learning alongside each other
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.080]   and strengthening one another,
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.360]   sharpening one another as we pursue learning
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.880]   about who our creator is
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.360]   and what he has for us to learn about him.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.000]   - That's really neat.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   I imagine that having six girls,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.280]   you had a built-in community, you had a built...
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.200]   And so did they help each other?
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.280]   Did they buddy up?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.360]   Did you have help?
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.120]   I'm assuming that your older girls were a big help
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.400]   with the younger ones when they were coming through.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.000]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.760]   I do, most of the time you'll find me saying
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.200]   that somewhere around nine years old,
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.320]   I think is like a magic time for little girls especially.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.080]   Of course, I have experience with girls.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.600]   They become so helpful.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.040]   And by the time we were getting to the last few kids
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.520]   that we've ended up with,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.080]   it's been interesting to see
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.360]   how those natural mothering skills come into play,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.040]   caring skills for one another.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.280]   So it's not just go grab mom a diaper,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.840]   it's let's sit down and read a book together.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.880]   And how can I help you with this puzzle?
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.000]   Or let's go outside and do this activity together
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.240]   or do nature sketching
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   and watching how each other develops in their skillset.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.240]   They learn by watching their older siblings.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   And then my older ones,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.240]   they reinforce what they do know
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   because they have to explain it to somebody else.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.680]   - Right, or help them with their memory work.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.200]   I can remember, yeah, my older daughter saying
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.280]   to my younger daughter, okay, really get this
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   'cause you're gonna use it in challenge.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.600]   So go ahead and remember this.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.000]   Be sure that- - You're gonna want it.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.440]   - Yes, that you're gonna want it.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.000]   That's really true. - Absolutely.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.360]   - That's nice that you had the counsel
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.240]   of the wiser older sisters to reinforce.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.960]   'Cause sometimes, let's be real,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   sometimes our kids take it better from somebody besides us.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   I know there were times when my younger daughter
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.880]   would go to her sister first for advice,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.080]   whether she thought I was an old fuddy-duddy
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.440]   or that I didn't quite understand her the way her sister.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   That was beautiful to me though,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.960]   because like you said,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   it fosters those nurturing skills between the children.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.200]   I really like that. - It does, yes.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:08.160]   - I feel like there's a lot of sharing of ideas
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.360]   and sharing of ways to do things.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.120]   I remember my older daughter giving my younger daughter tips
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.240]   on how to make this spreadsheet or how to fix this timeline
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.280]   or how to format this thing
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.880]   or the best way to memorize something.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.880]   So that's a beauty of a larger family
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.520]   is that you've got all different learning styles
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.120]   and always somebody has something to say
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.760]   about all the things.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's kind of nice. - Absolutely.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.480]   - And somebody who's always willing
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.920]   to do memory work with you.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.200]   - Oh, yes. - That was very handy.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.720]   I'm just really thankful
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.480]   that they are willing to pour into one another
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.480]   and they do see it as an advantage
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.120]   to get to review the memory work time and time again.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.400]   It comes up at the dinner table often,
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.840]   you say one little word
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.680]   and they bust out into a timeline song, right?
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.280]   - I know. - And you have to wait.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.160]   Sometimes that's how our kids,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.600]   after they grow up and go away to college,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.760]   they find each other
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.000]   because of the way they answer a question in class.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.640]   I know one of my daughters had a girl wait for her
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   outside a college classroom.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.520]   And she said, when my daughter came out,
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.320]   she said, "Are you CC?"
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.640]   Like, "Are you FBI?"
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.000]   "Are you CC?"
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.120]   And she could tell by the way
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.160]   that my daughter had answered a question in class,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.960]   these kids are gonna find each other
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.320]   'cause that memory work doesn't let you go.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.120]   So those are great blessings of a larger family,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   but what about some of the challenges, Denise?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.240]   - Let's see, challenges.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.400]   I would say that scheduling
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.440]   is definitely something that we have been,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   I can't say were because we're still doing it.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.960]   Scheduling is definitely one of the most challenging parts
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.160]   of large family or just multiple levels.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.040]   - Okay, do you mean juggling the schoolwork
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.760]   or juggling life or both?
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.480]   - Both, oh yes, both.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.880]   Because you want to have
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.960]   some kind of extracurricular sometimes,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.760]   whether it be, I call it extracurriculars, not church,
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.080]   but church activities alone are busy.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.040]   And then you have, if you introduce one sport-
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.800]   - Oh my word, I know.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.320]   - Ballet or dance class or something,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.240]   it adds a whole nother layer of things
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.840]   that you have to shift around constantly.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.000]   - And if they pick something different,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.080]   if they each pick a different thing, that's even crazier.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.840]   - And there are so many ways
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.800]   in which one can arrange how to pick
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.760]   for all of your children.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.960]   I know one mom,
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.120]   she lets every kid pick a different thing if they want
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.680]   and lets them land where they are and she manages it.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.520]   I don't know how she does it.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.800]   - That's really hard.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.320]   - That's not a way that I could manage it.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   - Absolutely, especially if you live farther
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.320]   and everybody has to be driven to their activity,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.800]   that could be really hard, okay?
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.040]   So what are some other ways to manage it?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.960]   - There's, well, the way that we've enjoyed doing it
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.520]   is I will let the oldest one pick
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.120]   what they would like to do
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720]   because they've also gone through
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.080]   what everybody else has picked ahead of them.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.160]   And so we all do it as a family
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.600]   and we try and pick something
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.520]   that has a large spread for the age range.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.160]   We hadn't done sports up until last year.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.280]   And so we got into soccer
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.880]   after having done dance and theater.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   So now we're all doing soccer
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.320]   and it's a homeschool league, thankfully,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.040]   but they start at age 10.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.840]   So my baby, she couldn't actually do it.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.960]   So what did they do?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.200]   Because it's a homeschool league.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   They said, "Well, she can be our mascot."
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.240]   She gets to go to all the practices
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.360]   and do some of the scrimmage games with them,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.960]   but she doesn't have a jersey
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.040]   and she doesn't play on the Saturday games,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.320]   but she is included in all of that.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.800]   And how wonderful that the community is set up that way,
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.240]   that they are understanding,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.840]   hey, here's the little last one of the family.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.560]   We're gonna just fold her in, yes.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.800]   And she gets to learn and play with her sisters.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.040]   And we all get to enjoy doing that together,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.120]   but not being so spread apart.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.400]   So thinking outside of the box,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.520]   sometimes on those sport things
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.000]   to see what kind of sports can you be involved in
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.640]   that do have a spread
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.560]   and will allow you to enjoy team sports
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.400]   or some other aspect, whether it be theater or dance.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.840]   We've done that a number of times throughout the years
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.960]   of just switching all together and doing it together
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.640]   so we can learn and grow and experience it as a family.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.200]   - That is actually a really lovely idea, Denise.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.080]   With my hobby family of only two girls,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.200]   I was able to let them choose.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   And blessedly, they mostly picked the same things.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.760]   They both were dancers from three years old
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   up through high school and they played soccer,
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   but they, well, one played longer than the other,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   but they picked, but I actually think
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.240]   that that's a lovely way to put family first
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.000]   and these extra activities second,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.320]   keeping the perspective of family first is really beautiful.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   So Denise, what was your initial experience with CC like?
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.840]   - Oh, sure.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.760]   So my first experience with Classical Conversations
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.760]   was a year before my daughter, even before we could join,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.920]   it wasn't in our town where we lived.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.120]   And so I studied it for about a year
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.760]   and then I heard of a friend that was starting a community.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.480]   I went to an information meeting and she says,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.160]   "I'm gonna start this community."
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.040]   And I said, "Well, I need it too.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.560]   "And whatever you need me to do,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.320]   "I'll do it to help bring this together," right?
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.320]   So that was my first year tutoring foundations.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.680]   And it was my first year for the next 10 years,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.120]   that's what I did, is tutor foundations
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.960]   with babies on the hip all throughout.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.120]   'Cause at that point I only had three girls
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   and I just kept right on going.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.880]   It was second nature at that point.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.920]   It wasn't anything challenging or hard
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.360]   in the sense of going and doing.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.440]   I wanted to learn alongside my girls.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.160]   It really helped me stay engaged with the memory work.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.840]   I got training.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   - That's so awesome.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.920]   - I'm gonna go to home school.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.680]   - So tutoring actually was not an extra burden,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.880]   but a help to you at that point.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.720]   And so-
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.520]   - Yes, I was confused about how to employ
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.920]   the classical model.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.520]   So it really helped me put some pieces together
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   that I was missing on my own.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.480]   - That has got to be encouraging.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.840]   Okay, listeners, you heard it here.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.840]   If you volunteer, if you agree to be a tutor,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.800]   you will get so much more out of it than you put into it.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   Because like Denise said, you'll get training,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   you will be employing the classical model
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.280]   and you'll have people who will mentor you
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   as you learn to do that.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.240]   And once you know how to do it in community,
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.280]   you do it naturally at home.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.480]   'Cause that's what I was gonna ask you, Denise.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.840]   Did your tutoring experience in those early years
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.440]   pay dividends as you became the lead learner
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.080]   in front of six little girls?
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   - Oh, definitely.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   We thoroughly repeated what we did in class.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.040]   And so I could take what each of the girls,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.880]   they were in different levels, right?
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.240]   And so they would come home
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.880]   and they would have three different versions
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.920]   of the way that they learned stuff in class.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.080]   We would come back home together
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   and we would get to see what each other did.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.040]   So then I facilitated another kind of class at home
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.760]   with the girls and they all would get their turn
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.960]   of demonstrating how they learned the memory work
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.920]   and model that for their sisters.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.360]   So it was a fun way for me to incorporate
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.480]   all of them together and not have to sit with each child
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.320]   individually with their own little play
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.520]   in of what they were doing,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.000]   which is what I had been doing up until that point.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.040]   And so it was wonderful to get to do
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.680]   all of this learning together
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   and not be siloed into these individual plans.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.160]   Yes.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.640]   - It strikes me that it is actually a blessing
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.440]   to have lots of kids
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.480]   because you've got lots of different learning styles.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.880]   And then if they're all in different foundations groups,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.680]   you or classes, small groups within your own community,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.840]   they've got exposure to lots of different ways
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.920]   of playing with the memory work
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.280]   and lots of different memory tools.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.600]   And so you've got a bigger pool to pull from
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.000]   when you've got a bunch of kids.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.840]   - We do.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.920]   - I suppose that it means
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.720]   that somebody always has a buddy too.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   Always has a buddy to play with,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.640]   always has a buddy to practice with,
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.920]   always have a buddy to mentor them.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.000]   - It is funny you say that
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   because I definitely wanted to have an even number of kids
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.600]   if there's anything I can do about it.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.240]   I grew up with an odd number
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.440]   and for whatever reason,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.560]   there was always two against one, right?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   It's somebody who was always left out.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.960]   And so the Lord was kind.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.240]   And I'm gonna say,
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.880]   here we are 21 years down the road that I was right.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.280]   Even numbers really helps.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.720]   - That is so fun.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.960]   Well, there's always a pair.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.840]   There's always a pair that can go together.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.400]   Well, that's really good.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.960]   Well, let me ask you this
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.080]   because I know it's not just,
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.760]   even though we're talking homeschooling,
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.360]   the juggling act is not just academically.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.080]   What's harder keeping up with multiple kids
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   physically, emotionally, relationally, or academically?
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:33.840]   - Wow, that's heavy.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   The, I would say the emotional side slash spiritual
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:47.240]   is harder because you want to be present with them
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.840]   in what they're experiencing,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.760]   in what they're seeing from their vantage point, right?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.840]   We're experiencing a little bit
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.200]   of what our heavenly father sees
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   watching our children grow up
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.400]   and we're one step removed thinking,
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.240]   oh, I remember that or I experienced that
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.600]   or that's not how I experienced it.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.160]   But it's interesting to see what they see.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.960]   - It's not what I would do, yeah.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.520]   - Exactly, it's not exactly what I would do.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.480]   But it has been challenging there
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.120]   because you want to be present with them
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.800]   and not be ruled by this academic world
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.560]   that we are also doing.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.280]   And so it's so important for us to keep in mind
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.920]   what the priorities are to remember
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.120]   to stay present with them,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.560]   whether it be a spiritual struggle,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.720]   an emotional struggle today or an academic one.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.160]   Usually the academics just highlight
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.440]   what is already brewing, right?
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.760]   It's just a tool that we use to help flush out
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.360]   some of those other areas of life
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.840]   because we are just trying to grow up mature Christians
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.240]   that will function in a society
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.000]   and be a blessing to the community around them.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.600]   It's not like the academics
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.360]   is gonna be the only thing that carries them.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.400]   - No, and I've heard you say before that
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.880]   what your goal, you and Brian's goal
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.000]   was to lean into the resources
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.960]   but use them to guide good conversations
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.040]   that would help you shape the character
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.960]   you wanted your daughters to have.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.240]   - That's true, it is.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.400]   We focused more on that.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600]   And I did have a community of women,
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.640]   parents around us in our CC group and in our church
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   that helped us keep that focus.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.560]   It wasn't something that we just came up with
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.280]   on our own, of course,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.520]   but if you keep your focus
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   on creating that mature Christian person,
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.480]   that's what we're all striving to do
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.240]   in this Christian worldview is to generate that,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.320]   then we're not going to be as easily distracted
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.280]   by what needs to go on the transcript
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.240]   or what college they're gonna go to.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.200]   It's more about how are they going,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.560]   are they going to persevere
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.200]   in raising up their own faithful family?
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.000]   That's what we're trying to accomplish
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.680]   and not just this more present,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.440]   immediate future that they have.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.680]   - That is a great, great reminder for all of us.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.760]   No matter how many kids we have,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.200]   it's a great reminder of the eternal purpose
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.320]   of what we're doing.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.520]   We're not raising kids to have perfect transcripts
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.320]   or full transcripts or any transcript at all, really.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.280]   - Right, right.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.480]   - We're raising, I've heard you say before,
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.600]   beautiful humans that worship God.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.840]   - That's our goal, beautiful humans.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.240]   - And then realizing that small families,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.000]   medium-sized families, big families,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.280]   we get really involved with making sure
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.240]   that all the academics are covered
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.400]   and that everybody has a buddy to study with
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.520]   and a mentor and everybody has got a reading
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.680]   and a discussing buddy.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.520]   But then you've helped me see, Denise,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.120]   that really the thing that we need to be certain of
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.360]   is that we are giving every child
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:20.880]   the love and the attention that their heart needs
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.120]   and that their spirit needs.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.360]   And yeah, if you figure out a way to do all the school
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.440]   with all the kids, that's great,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.640]   but you also need to find a way to be there
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   with each child as they grow towards the Lord.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.000]   That's really great.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.200]   There's lots of details to manage.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.360]   When did you realize you needed some help
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.840]   to manage all the details and what kind of help?
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.880]   Did you just pair the girls up?
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.880]   Did you have them studying the same thing,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.640]   some of them studying the same things at the same time?
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.800]   Did you have a schedule?
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.200]   Did you have a system?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.560]   Did you have tutor help?
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.280]   How did you do it, Denise?
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.440]   - Oh, well, we did employ plenty of help
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.000]   'cause it does take a community to support you
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.560]   and raise up faithful Christians.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.280]   And so- - That's encouraging.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.640]   Okay, I want everybody to hear that.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.600]   Yes, you don't have to do it all by yourself.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.080]   Okay, that's awesome.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.840]   Thank you for saying that out loud.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   You employed other people to help you with this big task.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.000]   Gotcha.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.880]   - We did do just friends down the street.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.440]   We would pair up and do schedules
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.760]   that we could do memory work together
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.280]   or maybe do a strand together.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.160]   That's been one thing.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.200]   There was a time period early on
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.560]   when we were trying to juggle all the math struggles
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.080]   and trying to figure out how do we meet the demands
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.760]   of what each child needs in all these different curricula.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.960]   I had employed the use of a tutor,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.120]   my friend, Joni, God bless your soul.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.760]   She's helped so many of us get through those years
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.000]   because trying to meet the needs of each student
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.360]   and keep consistent on going back and checking the lesson
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.840]   and grading the lesson
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.080]   and reviewing the questions that they have.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.720]   It's a lot of work for each individual child
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   at each individual level.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.840]   And that can be the case for several subjects
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   the way that our traditional system has set up.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.320]   So I'm thankful that homeschooling does allow you
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.400]   to adjust what you need,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.480]   design it in a way that you can create it
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.320]   into a one-room schoolhouse.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.480]   Joni even did that in the way that she was handling the math.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.240]   We got to all see how that was.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.560]   And so it was a temporary solution
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.400]   that several of us used for a time
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.600]   because we saw how she did that.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.760]   And then we figured out, okay,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.880]   how can I do that at home too?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.040]   Because that's not something necessarily
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.600]   we all wanna leave the house all the time to go do things,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.480]   but you use it as a tool to help sharpen
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.520]   what you're doing at home.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.360]   - You have a mentor yourself.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.320]   You're learning a system.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.920]   I love that 'cause as parents,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.360]   we don't just grow up knowing it all.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.920]   So we have to learn.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.640]   Good, good.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.920]   We are gonna talk,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.240]   'cause I have some questions about math.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.440]   Specifically, I wanna talk to you a little bit
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.920]   about the math map
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.280]   and how that makes one-room schoolhouse
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.880]   that you were just talking about more possible.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.480]   But I wanna hold that for a minute.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.120]   I know that there are-
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.480]   - Hold off my gushing.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.480]   - Well, there are lots of families
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.960]   that are just getting a toe in the water of the math map.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.040]   And I want you to kind of wet our appetite
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.920]   a little bit more for that
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.480]   so that we are gonna do that.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:57.120]   So you had some tutors, you had some schedules.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.560]   How did you stay connected
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.480]   to the learning that was happening?
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.560]   Did you have one-on-one time?
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.000]   Do you still have one-on-one time with everybody?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.160]   And how often do you do that?
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.560]   And how do you choose what to talk to them about
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.880]   in this one-on-one time?
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.480]   - Well, I will say that I used Lees,
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.560]   which is at the core that has the schedule in it,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.760]   my age, right?
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.960]   And you start out with everybody all together,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.760]   and then you just peel off the youngest ones
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.400]   as they either lose interest
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.320]   or you've covered what their level is at.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.520]   And so it's a review for everybody else.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.400]   Start with the all together and then just peel them off.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.560]   And I found that to be really helpful
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.160]   in the number of areas of study for our girls.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.480]   And so then it allowed me a few minutes each hour
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.840]   to finish up with the oldest children
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.920]   so that they would be able to finish out
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:57.720]   or get additional one-on-one attention or two-on-one,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.280]   'cause honestly they were close enough
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.440]   that I was usually sitting with a couple of kids
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.840]   right up next to me
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.200]   as we were going through those essentials years.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.560]   And then even in the challenge,
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.040]   it's just shifted a little bit.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.880]   So instead of, while we do start out all together,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.640]   we do have certain subjects that I like to do together.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.920]   We would like, I like to start out math,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.880]   everybody together around the table,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.680]   'cause it doesn't matter what level you're doing,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.240]   we're all doing the same topic
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.600]   and can dig into and hear each other's questions.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.000]   Well, then we can do the same thing for reading.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.680]   We can do read-alouds of some of the work
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.400]   that challenge kids are doing
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.680]   so that the other kids get to experience it
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.280]   and come to love those stories and hear about them
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.200]   before they actually read and write about them themselves.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.000]   So that's been helpful over the years.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.480]   And then we would also set up designated times
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.760]   for certain kids, for certain subjects.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.960]   So you can pick a particular subject
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.560]   that you wanna concentrate on and grow your family
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.440]   and say, this year, we're gonna really concentrate
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.880]   on science and try and dig in deeper to this.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.720]   And all the other ones,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.640]   you do what you need to do to get through that year,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.800]   but then you can really dig in deep on that one subject.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.240]   So that was a favorite way.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.200]   Another friend had explained to me
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.680]   that that's how she did it.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.520]   I loved that.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   - Did you let each girl pick the subject
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.720]   that they wanted to dive deep with you on?
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.360]   Or did you guys just,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.480]   did everybody dove deep into science in the same year?
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.320]   Did you do it?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.840]   - It was the same subject for the whole family
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.720]   for that year.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.880]   And it was picked by mom
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.320]   because it was usually an observation
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:43.800]   of what I thought we needed to strengthen as a family
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.240]   or what we needed to prepare,
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.880]   perhaps the oldest one,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.920]   depending on where we were in the transcript years,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.800]   the challenge years of what do I wanna ensure
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.680]   that we hone in on their comprehension and understanding
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.320]   so that they can continue to learn
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.760]   because it wasn't like I was gonna teach them everything
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.920]   they were gonna need to ever learn about this topic.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.760]   It was, what do they need to know
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.240]   so that they will persevere in learning
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.520]   throughout their lifetime?
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.000]   - Yeah, that's really true.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   That is a hard key for us
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.840]   who were not classically educated to grab ahold of
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.360]   is that we're not teaching the exhaustive list
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.840]   of all the things about every subject.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.800]   We are teaching the skills of learning.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.640]   I'm teaching my girls,
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.120]   not everything they'll ever need to know about biology,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.360]   but how to learn whatever it is
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.520]   that they need to learn about biology
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.920]   even after they leave my home.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.240]   - Right, exactly. - I like that.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.120]   That's really good.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.480]   Did you ever have
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:51.880]   like one-on-one times that you had with each girl?
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.000]   Maybe, I know I had one daughter who,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.360]   if I did not sit and do her math with her,
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.760]   it was probably not gonna happen
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.360]   'cause there's always a good reason to move on.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.920]   And I had one that I did,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   I remember doing foundations geography with her at one point
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.720]   because she got really flustered
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.200]   by all the big strange names of African capitals.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.840]   And I can remember sitting down
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.040]   and doing all of chemistry with one
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.680]   just so that we kept moving forward.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.960]   Did you have check-in times or with your girls
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.080]   or special one-on-ones for subjects
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.760]   that were either troublesome or delightful for them?
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   - Absolutely.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.480]   Having the schedule written out or on a device,
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.480]   whatever needs your family has in that area,
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   it definitely requires planning.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.680]   So we would pick specific blocks of time for a specific child
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.960]   and say, this is gonna be your opportunity to ask questions.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.520]   I would really love to hear about this particular subject
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   or this strand that you're studying and have a check-in.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.880]   But if you have other questions that are more pressing,
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.640]   I would be really glad to chat with you about those.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.600]   And so teaching them how to use their time wisely
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.680]   so they could come forward and ask questions
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.760]   that are gonna help them persevere in their studies
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.960]   is really a skill that they have to learn
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.600]   because I told them, I don't wanna sit here
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   and figure out whether or not you added something correctly
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.040]   or multiplied something correctly on your math.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.880]   I'd rather spend an hour with you
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.240]   digging into one problem that really stumped you.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.080]   - Yes, good.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.520]   - And have fun with that, right?
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.280]   And so it was teaching them how to use that time effectively
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.720]   was something that we worked on over time.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.560]   - That's really good.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.960]   That really trains them to expect that consistency
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.840]   of time with you and it trains them to use the time well.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:00.440]   I like that, I like that.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.760]   You know what I discovered too is that
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.120]   even as my girls got older, if we had a scheduled time,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   if they knew every day at this time,
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.320]   I'm gonna have mom's full attention.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.720]   I'm gonna have mama just to myself
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.640]   and she's not gonna let any work bother her
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.680]   or my sister come in, nothing's gonna...
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.480]   It somehow was comforting to them.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.440]   I mean, they could kind of rest in that.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   - It is.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.920]   They do enjoy having that thing to look forward to,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.680]   that time to look forward to.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.160]   They can count on it and the Lord willing,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   we work out that schedule and each time,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   maybe we'll flex if there's something weird in a week,
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.600]   but they do look for and ask for their time.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.080]   It's definitely something that they've leaned into
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.000]   and appreciate the time that we do spend with them
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.160]   'cause my husband and I do it together.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.720]   It's not that I'm doing all of this on my own,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.480]   not by any sense of the imagination.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.400]   So we will pair off and pick different subjects
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.960]   that we enjoy, especially that we're more gifted in
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.240]   and bless the children that way by spending that time
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.200]   and demonstrating the kind of joy that you have
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.080]   and learning beyond where they are at this point.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.400]   - So much good riches in there, you guys.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.600]   I mean, she's just talked a lot about a lot of things,
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.640]   about having the spouse help, not doing it all by yourself
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.040]   and really focusing in on the relationship you have
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.960]   with your individual child, giving them something,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.680]   some time that they can count on.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.520]   And then two, modeling for your child
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.440]   the skills of lifelong learning.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.840]   Let them see you learning with them.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:55.480]   Just let learning be something your family does,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   no matter what size your family is.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.560]   That's really good.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.480]   You have mentioned One Room Schoolhouse a bunch today
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.720]   in our conversation, and we've talked about
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.880]   the One Room Schoolhouse and how that's such a goal.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.600]   And Leigh, in a lot of the books that Leigh has written,
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.880]   she talks about how great the One Room Schoolhouse concept
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.960]   is and how that should be our goal.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.200]   Sometimes that's really hard to wrap our modern minds around
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.200]   that we could all do something together,
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.440]   a six-year-old and a 10-year-old and a 16-year-old
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.680]   and a 35-year-old.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.840]   And how could we all be getting something
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.160]   out of this together?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.080]   What did you think about the One Room Schoolhouse
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.480]   when that was first presented to you?
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.960]   It's funny that you bring that part up in particular.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.080]   And I might use that word a lot
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.240]   just because that was my keyhole that I was missing
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.040]   that could not open the door
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.880]   to how to manage homeschooling.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.400]   That's what I was most overwhelmed by
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.320]   when I first was homeschooling.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:07.560]   I was a few years in and I did one cycle with one kid.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.720]   And then when the next one started kindergarten,
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.400]   I started her on cycle one again.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.600]   And so I'm doing cycle three over here.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.120]   I don't remember which curriculum it was now,
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.400]   but it's like what we have our cycles
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.600]   in Classical Conversations, but it was that kind of track.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.520]   And I'm thinking, how in the world am I gonna track
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   two different parts of history and two different sciences
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:29.960]   and all this kind of stuff?
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.160]   So I didn't really understand how to put that together
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.000]   until we were with our Classical Conversations community
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.160]   and got the training in there.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.920]   So I was amazed at how simple it was
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.520]   and how it just completely, I was completely obscured
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.200]   in seeing how to play that out with my three little people
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.280]   that I had at the time.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:53.000]   - Yes, it does make life easier.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.080]   If you can wrap your modern mind around the whole concept,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.760]   it does make life easier.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.640]   It's not that you're doing history
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.200]   at three different levels.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.040]   It's that your children may be taking it in
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.920]   in three different ways and to three different degrees,
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.480]   but you are sharing the same information.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.720]   You are all bathing in the same pool of water
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   and some people are just getting wetter than others, okay?
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.640]   - I love that analogy.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.240]   - So I like that.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   And that is the ideal that is attached
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.880]   to the MathMap now.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   The MathMap is the new classical math curriculum
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.600]   that CC is rolling out
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.520]   and that some families have begun to use now.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.960]   Talk about, I know, Denise,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.880]   that you are a big proponent of the MathMap.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.080]   So I want you to talk about MathMap
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.200]   and how it's revolutionizing
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.400]   your math education at your house.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.240]   - Thank you.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.160]   Certainly, I am so thankful
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.440]   at how the concept is put together
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:12.440]   that you can have one lesson for mom to teach from
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.880]   and reach all the children that you have sitting around you.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.560]   For my many years of math,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.120]   we often, it was easy to just say it,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.400]   we had four levels of math going.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.440]   Throughout many of our homeschool years
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.080]   that we've been going through.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.480]   And there was never a time in which I had four hours
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.640]   to dedicate to my children
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.720]   in order to accomplish their math lesson.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.560]   - Okay, let me just--
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.960]   - So each one needed a separate window of time
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.800]   just for that one subject.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.120]   - Just let me say this for a minute.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.080]   That's why a lot of our listeners
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.680]   are listening to this podcast
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.240]   because they've got four or five or six or seven children
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.240]   and everybody needs math
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   and everybody needs language arts
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.160]   and everybody needs something different.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.320]   And I don't have 14 hours in every day
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.720]   to do this individually.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.360]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.760]   All right, tell us how this works.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.840]   - Well, what I have found is that the lesson
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.160]   does go from a very high level view
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.280]   of seeing what beauty there is in this particular dimension,
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.520]   this particular level or week that we're studying in.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.960]   And you can go as deep as your children comprehend
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.960]   and then take them just a little bit farther
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.600]   to whet their appetite for another time of exposure
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.880]   that they're gonna get down the road.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.680]   But there is such a feast that's offered that we,
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.440]   I am stretched in what I am learning
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.760]   and understanding the language of math
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.200]   in my own understanding.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.680]   I love the pages of invention that we get to look over
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.320]   and see what's familiar and what's unfamiliar.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.280]   And that's not a threat
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.720]   to what we have experienced in the past
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.160]   is my child, for some reason,
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.760]   several of my children would get frustrated at the lesson
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.520]   and thinking I should already know this.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.760]   - Yes.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.600]   - Right? - Yes.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.120]   - And then their emotions start riling up
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:10.360]   all over the place and it makes math last two hours.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.800]   It's really frustrating, right?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.680]   But then with this, I feel like the frustration level
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   has been significantly dropped
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   because it is about exploring, discovering, wondering
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.840]   and fanning that flame about their study
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.400]   of this particular topic
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.440]   instead of why don't you know this already?
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.760]   Why don't you understand this layer
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.120]   that you should have comprehended two lessons ago?
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.880]   So it's relieving a lot of pressure, frustration on them
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.080]   in the way that we are approaching our studies at this point.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.040]   - Well, I remember as a child,
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.680]   there were some math concepts that were hard for me.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   And I look back now and I blame the way it was presented.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:02.600]   But for me, there was a lot of blame and shame
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.040]   connected with math.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.320]   And it's not that my parents shamed me
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.240]   and probably not that my teachers did, but I felt it.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.760]   I felt ashamed if I didn't, like you said,
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.400]   already know something.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.800]   And so I love what you said about the math map
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   that it brings us into a discussion.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.440]   It ushers us into wonder
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   and it's okay for us to observe and to compare
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.800]   and to attend to things.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.720]   The whole point is that we're noticing things,
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.720]   that the point is thinking and conversation.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.200]   - Yes. - And I like it that-
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.080]   - Reading, a lot of reading.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.920]   - Yes, there's a lot of reading.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.360]   I love that the connections
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.800]   sometimes are not made during the lesson,
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.680]   but later during the day.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   Has that happened to you?
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.840]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.800]   Their playtime, they are allowed to contemplate
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.400]   whatever's going through their little brains.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.680]   And with their playtime,
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.840]   the studies have shown that during playtime,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.720]   it does allow them to put ideas and concepts together.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.600]   And the children are coming back
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.800]   and my neighbor can attest to this.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.960]   Her son is putting ideas together
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.880]   about the concept of fractions
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.520]   and relationship of numbers. - Oh, cool.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.080]   - And we're seeing that with our girls as well,
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.240]   of how they're thinking about bigger ideas
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.000]   and the concept of the idea of what we're talking about
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.720]   and not getting hung up on the actual numbers
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.280]   or the computation of numbers.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.040]   It's what are the big ideas?
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.520]   What are the bigger shapes that we're looking at?
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.240]   How is this a conversation
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.440]   that has been going on for centuries, right?
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.480]   And we are getting to jump in the pool at this level
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.520]   and see what's been happening all around us.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.360]   And now we get to learn about it
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.680]   and start contributing and asking questions.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.960]   - That is so cool.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.000]   And the cool thing about what you just said is that,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.360]   so a six-year-old is having exposure to the same thing
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.120]   that the 10-year-old is having exposure to.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.520]   But that means that when the six-year-old is 10 years old,
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.640]   he or she is gonna be exposed to those ideas again.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.680]   So it's a restful way to learn,
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.360]   knowing that you're gonna come back to these concepts,
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.560]   to these ideas over and over again.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.560]   And as your understanding deepens,
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   then the hold it will have on your mind
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.560]   and your heart and your life will also deepen.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.600]   So that's cool.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.880]   It's kind of like a feast and we eat a little bit now
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.800]   and we're gonna eat a little bit next year
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.080]   and we're gonna eat a little bit the year after that.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   And eventually our palates will be really well-developed.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:03.960]   - Eventually.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.040]   And that's what I'm counting on.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.920]   I can see the fruit of what we've done
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.600]   in these other subjects.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:13.520]   Latin is one that I have just grown to love
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.360]   because of the way that it's just been the repetition
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.320]   of me going back through and starting over with another kid
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.040]   and doing the foundation's memory work
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.440]   and seeing the connections as I learned
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.840]   and taught essentials.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.240]   It's been really fascinating.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.080]   And so I have that same hope for this conversation in math
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.840]   that we are all going to grow up and love this together.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.480]   I am a person who does love and enjoy math.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.560]   I thought physics was the coolest thing ever
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.400]   when I was in high school.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.720]   - My husband loves physics.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.440]   - I could not translate that
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.120]   or explain it to anybody else, right?
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.280]   And it's hard to do that.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.680]   Well, this is giving us the shared common language
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.160]   that we can use with one another
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.560]   and converse with one another
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.000]   and share these tidbits that I've picked up
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.640]   and share the excitement
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.280]   so that we can all journey down this conversation together
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.360]   over the next however many years
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.440]   we're gonna be doing this.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.360]   - That is so cool.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.800]   And because you have lots of voices in the conversation,
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.120]   your conversation is richer and richer every day.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.480]   That is so cool.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.680]   Yet another blessing of juggling multiple students
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.600]   is that you have enough voices to make a chorus,
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.840]   not just a solo or a duet.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.320]   That's kind of nice.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.160]   I love that.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.000]   Okay, Denise, we have to bring it to a close.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.680]   Although this has been the best part of my day so far,
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.480]   I have to tell you.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   Let me ask you, if you had one encouraging word to say
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.920]   to families with lots of students
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.160]   and to parents who are worried that they're juggling
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.200]   but they're almost dropping something,
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.480]   what would you say?
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.400]   - I would say, know that we've all heard the adage,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.920]   the days are long and the years are short.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.240]   Keep focused on the point
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.160]   that you are building worshipers of God
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.840]   and that this academics,
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.440]   the academics that you're dealing with
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.360]   right there in front of you
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.120]   is such a very temporal time of their life.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.000]   It's such a small percentage of their life.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   It does set them up for a lot, for many, many years,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.840]   but really the goal is to set up really strong,
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.800]   faithful worshipers of God.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.400]   And if your school is impeding on that,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.280]   we need to rethink and we have the conversation
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.960]   with your household about how to repair that.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.480]   You're not gonna end up winning or checking all your boxes
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.680]   if you've left your children's heart behind.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.000]   - That is so deeply true.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   I appreciate that.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.240]   What I hear is that if I'm juggling a lot of balls
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.320]   and I have to let one drop, it needs to be the academics.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.720]   We need to hold those heart balls and those spirit balls
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.880]   and keep juggling.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.880]   Thank you, Denise, for sharing that.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.400]   I appreciate you sharing your heart.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.000]   This has been awesome.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.720]   Families, I know that you have gleaned lots of nuggets
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.880]   that you're gonna chew on again and again.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.160]   If we have families who are listening today
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.040]   who've thought, "Hmm, what do you mean
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.840]   "you homeschool classically?"
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.560]   Or, "What is this classical conversations foundations
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.720]   "of which you speak?"
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   And, "How are you guys learning all about things together?"
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:40.680]   And, "Could I go actually see a one-room schoolhouse?"
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.800]   Well, actually you could.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.000]   I wanna tell you that you can observe
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.440]   a classical conversations community day in action
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.160]   for yourself by visiting an open house.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.320]   During an open house, you and your children
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.600]   will get some hands-on experience
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.080]   with homeschooling within community.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.600]   And, you'll see firsthand
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.640]   what classical conversations is all about.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.680]   So, if you're curious, if you wanna visit,
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.680]   here's what you do.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   Go to classicalconversations.com/events/, okay?
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:24.280]   And, you will be able to find an open house near you.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.560]   You'll be able to see what Denise has described in action.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.560]   So, classicalconversations.com/events/, all right?
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.640]   Denise, thank you again.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.680]   This has been awesome.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.520]   Listeners--
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.000]   - Always a pleasure, thank you.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.960]   - I loved it.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.000]   Listeners, I will see you next week, all right?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.840]   Bye-bye.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.300]   (gentle music)
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.360]   you
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
