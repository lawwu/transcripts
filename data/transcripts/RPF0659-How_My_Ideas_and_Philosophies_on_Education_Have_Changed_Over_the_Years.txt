I can wait and just wait until they're ready. And waiting until they're ready seems like it can be a very important strategy. That would be, if I were to say, what is the biggest change that has happened for me is I've grown increasingly confident that you can wait until a child is ready and that there is value in all the things that are important to you.

[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:11.140]   and I think about the things that I'm rude and abusive in my behavior towards others,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   The rocket boosters come back and land is pretty cool.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   It's worth making an effort to do.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   We took him to that and we showed him a video of it so they could understand more of what was happening.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   It's not as though there's not a place for that.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   I think there really is.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   But what I observe and my theory is that things like reading are hard usually for a young child,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   whereas things like video are easy because there's no imagination needed for a child when they're watching video.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   They already have all of the words because they've learned how to read.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.160]   They already have all of the words because they've learned how to read.

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:37:05.280]   I'm thankful and gratified to see that in absence of cotton candy and ice cream,
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.180]   I'm watching my children start to interact and engage with a lot of reading and a lot of things that are pretty challenging.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   I'll watch carefully over the next couple years and see how that goes. But as I see it, I need to really successfully cement the skills and the love of reading before ever bringing in the cotton candy and ice cream.

[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:38.100]   with the exception of one year to government school that I went to a private Christian school from seventh grade through 12th grade and I went to a private Christian university for my bachelor's degree and then I got a master's degree in financial planning through distant distance learning at a secular financial planning college so when I look back one of the resentments that I have is the massive waste of time that I perceive so many of those classes to have been.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:38.100]   My parents had other reasons for putting me in the school.

[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.300]   The interests that could have been indulged, the businesses that could have been built.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:25.460]   If I weren't stuck in that time-wasting system, sitting in class, hearing a teacher lecture about something that could have been learned from the book, that's one of the resentments that I have.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.140]   It's not an emotional resentment.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.060]   I talk about it freely and openly.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.420]   Don't worry, my parents, I don't have anything against them for it.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.200]   It's just one of those things when you look back and you consider.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.960]   But on the other hand, you look at people who hold a lot of value for their lives.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.020]   You look at people who hold a lot of value for their lives.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:36.020]   You look at people who hold a lot of value for their lives.
[01:08:36.020 --> 01:09:04.780]  , and there seemed to be a list of dangers and things that they could be exposed to, where resentments that they could have.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:04.880]   And so I don't know a solution other than to say, let's trust the parents to look at their child and discern what is in the best interest of their child at that time.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   Some of the biggest challenges of homeschooling involve things like curriculum choice.
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:04.920]   Also just things like maintaining a positive, motivated environment.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.180]   It seems like many homeschoolers are not going to school.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:05.220]   It seems like many homeschoolers are not going to school.

[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:05.760]  , not going to school.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.300]   It seems like many homeschooling parents can just slack off and allow their child to slack off.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:06.700]   Not going to school.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.000]   It seems like many homeschoolers are not going to school.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.180]   And I don't see how that's good for the child.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:07.300]   It seems like many homeschoolers are not going to school.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:07.640]   It seems like many homeschoolers are not going to school.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:07.680]   Sometimes you put a child into a competitive environment at a more traditional mainstream school, and that can raise up a challenge for them.

[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:22.240]   One of the challenges of homeschooling is you don't have as many things available to you.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:22.500]   One of the challenges of homeschooling is you don't have as many things available to you.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:39.460]   So you look at homeschooling, for example, I did a lot of theater when I was in high school.

[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:38.940]   The only thing that's going to be perfected is that there are private schools that do exist, but a lot of the private schooling seems to be not original and new and focused around the best interests of the child. It seems to be one of a couple of things. Most of the time, in my observation, many private schools simply take the industrial school model that was perfected in the government schools, and then either in a secular private school, they simply say, well, we're going to eject the bad kids, and we're only going to have rich kids, and we'll have better teachers, and we'll have better teachers.

[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:08.520]   I think ultimately the future where the best results are going to be had for parents who are looking for something is going to be a big, big difference compounded over a number of years.

[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   And so that's something that another kind of little weird thing that we're into.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   You see this with homeschooling with the use of homeschooling co-ops and such.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   The first thing is that it's a very common thing that we're seeing in homeschooling is that the number of kids who are going to be able to go to school are going to be able to go to school.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   The second thing is that it's a very common thing that we're seeing in homeschooling is that the number of kids who are going to be able to go to school are going to be able to go to school.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:08.560]   The third thing is that it's a very common thing that we're seeing in homeschooling is that the number of kids who are going to be able to go to school are going to be able to go to school.

[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:38.580]  ,
[01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:38.580]   and the last thing is that generally I don't want my children being taught by most other people's children and that's what happens you send most children into a school system and very quickly now they come back and you have to a whole lot of stuff that standards that you don't that you hold as a parent that other people don't just very very difficult especially the young years that's super important but then but there is a consideration there that is certainly true such as friendships and community activities and can a child learn to relate to peers of their own age well the
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   the other reason such a silly objection is it's pretend that somehow homeschoolers just don't leave their house and in general homeschoolers yeah you have three or four hours a day but homeschoolers are far more available to go wakeboarding in the afternoon or to go camping this weekend etc and so if there's a are there other sources of of groups of children such as a neighborhood or such as a church group etc then there are plenty of opportunities for children to build and maintain friendships and instead of being in an artificial environment where you're forced by the government to be in a class with somebody who's bullying
