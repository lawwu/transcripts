[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.100]   Today on the show, I'm gonna share with you
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700]   kind of a current report,
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.280]   tell you a little bit about my current thinking
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.080]   and strategy, answer some personal questions
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.880]   with regard to my children's education.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.640]   Over the years here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.220]   a common theme of the show has been the value
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.720]   of education.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.860]   Obviously, education has a direct financial payoff
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.560]   and it's important for living a whole life.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.060]   And I have some rather strong views on the subject.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.300]   I've been very open with those views.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.640]   And I've shared over the years a little bit
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.340]   about some of my ideas.
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.500]   But the challenge has been that when I first started
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.140]   this show, I think, if my timeline is correct,
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.040]   I think my wife and I, our first child was six months old.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   Well, at this point in time, our eldest child
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.340]   is closer to six, almost six.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.120]   And so things are changing, of course, with experience.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.760]   And I found this to be a common theme of my life.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.980]   I have a certain idea, a certain perspective,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.860]   a certain opinion when I am young.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.760]   And then as I get older and accumulate more experience,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.960]   more insight, perhaps a little bit more maturity,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.140]   I look to see if those ideas change,
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.940]   if those ideas have grown
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.040]   or if I've learned something that shows me
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.540]   the previous idea was wrong.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.000]   I wanna be quick to admit to myself and to anybody else
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.780]   when I get something wrong,
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.720]   but I also want to stay true to a vision,
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.480]   whatever vision I've had as a young person.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   Because I think that those visions are important.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.580]   It is very humbling, of course, when you get older
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.360]   and you hear yourself say something
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.900]   or you remember, you hear someone else say something
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.720]   and you remember how you said something similar
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.060]   when you were younger
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.140]   and you think of how foolish your younger self was.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.400]   It's extremely humbling when you're in that situation.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.240]   I try to be humbled by that and change my words
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.040]   and adjust as I grow older.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680]   We all should be growing.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880]   But I'm not ready just to throw aside
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.320]   all kinds of every vision, every idea that you have,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.760]   because there's something valuable about those ideas.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   There's something that takes you through
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.320]   even as you grow and perhaps adapt your ideas a little bit.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.600]   So in today's show, I'm gonna share with you
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.260]   just a little bit about what we're doing,
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.100]   what influences have been helpful to me.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.060]   And I'm intending this not to be a show
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.500]   that comes from the perspective of an expert to a student,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.860]   but simply as a fellow journeyer with you.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.300]   I have been very vocal about my position,
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.500]   which is that a very wise thing for all of us to do
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.180]   is to pull your children out of government schools.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660]   I've talked extensively about the reasons why
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.040]   and I still hold to that position.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.580]   But the challenge comes that if you are inclined
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.400]   in that direction, let's say that any of the ideas
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.320]   or arguments I presented have resonated with you
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800]   in some way or you've wondered if they might resonate,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.560]   and so you're thinking about pulling your children
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.260]   out of a government school and doing something else,
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.800]   now you have to figure out what that something else is.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.160]   And that's tough.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.720]   That's really, really tough.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.540]   Because there is a wide world of options available to you.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.720]   The government school approach is easy
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.760]   because your house or your apartment,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.360]   your dwelling place is located
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720]   within a geographic school district.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   You will go to the government educational institution
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   of that geographic school district,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.800]   and they'll assign you to the local school
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.400]   that fits your districting.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.840]   And then you will just simply take your child there.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.320]   And there was not really gonna be many options
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   for your child to choose from.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.520]   At the older years, perhaps there's a little bit of choice
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   among the classes that are taken,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.540]   but the educational philosophy is going to be
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.720]   whatever philosophy is taught by that school,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.200]   whatever's held by that principal,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.660]   whatever understanding about education
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.920]   your child's teachers have.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.900]   You have no say over the teachers,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.340]   you have no say over the principal,
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.160]   and you have no say over the school.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.940]   But when you pull your child out of that,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.740]   you have a wide range of options.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.880]   Do you send your child to the private school
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.280]   that's a mile away from your house?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.500]   Or do you send them to the one that's across town?
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.960]   Do you choose a Montessori style of education?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   Or do you choose a Waldorf school?
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.220]   Or do you choose a private Christian school?
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.640]   Or do you choose a secular private school?
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.840]   Or do you homeschool?
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.160]   And don't even open up the doors on homeschooling.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.320]   If you homeschool, what curriculum do you do?
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.440]   Do you do this curriculum or that curriculum?
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.320]   And how do you put it together?
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   And what subjects does your child need to study, et cetera?
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.400]   It's a little overwhelming.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.200]   Check that, it's a lot overwhelming.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.540]   And so I just wanna share with you as a fellow journeyer
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.180]   with the caveat that, again, for context,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.580]   my eldest is not yet six,
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.700]   with the caveat of what we're doing
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.380]   and what I think is working
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.980]   and how I think parents could think through
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.060]   some of these things.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.460]   I, of course, am always welcome for your insight.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.780]   I do try to solicit and listen carefully
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.940]   to the wisdom of my elders.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.780]   So if you have wisdom to offer, feel free.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.280]   But I'll just share as a fellow journeyer
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   for anybody in a similar boat or with younger children,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.820]   some of the things that we are learning as we go.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.640]   I'll begin my outline with some things
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.980]   that I have changed my mind on and changed my opinion on.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.380]   And I'll begin with the formal structure
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.740]   of early child education.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.780]   Way back in Radical Personal Finance, episode 77,
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.900]   I talked about the value and importance
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.100]   of early childhood education.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.740]   That show was the starting of a series.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.220]   It was called "How to Pay for College Part One,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.980]   Teach Your Baby to Read, RPF 0077."
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.380]   And I never really finished that episode.
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.640]   I remember I had a listener who wrote to me,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.300]   said, "I wish you'd finish this episode,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.720]   the series I mean."
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.620]   Because I had it planned for a long series,
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.380]   but other things came in the way.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.500]   And I never really finished that series.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.100]   Now, at the time, I had first come across
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.100]   the one of the popularizers of that philosophy,
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.060]   a man named Glenn Doman.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.220]   I think his first name was Glenn.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.660]   Anyway, Doman, "The Doman Method."
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.740]   He wrote a book called "Teach Your Baby to Read."
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.360]   I started getting online, looking around,
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.260]   and I was so impressed with the results
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.780]   and the things that, with the results that he was,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.940]   that some of his disciples were achieving,
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.540]   that I thought, "This is really great."
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.940]   And I quickly found that he was a,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.220]   that certainly there were many people
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.060]   who disagreed with him.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.180]   It's controversies in life.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.980]   Everything is just full of controversies,
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.420]   no matter what position you hold,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.180]   no matter what opinion you have.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.580]   Man, everything is, you'll always find somebody out there
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.380]   who wants to tell you how wrong you are.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.940]   And so certainly there were people about Doman.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.480]   I was aware of that, but I found it very inspiring.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.420]   So we started doing some of the Doman methodologies
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.780]   with our first child.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.200]   But we never committed to it fully enough
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.780]   to grasp or to get all the benefits
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.340]   that some other parents got from it.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.060]   We never committed to it.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.660]   And whose fault is that?
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.500]   My fault, is that?
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.940]   I wouldn't say there's any fault with the problems.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.340]   We just never committed to it.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.420]   And today I acknowledge that I still think
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.220]   that for parents who are heavily committed to it, et cetera,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.180]   it's probably fine.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.780]   It's probably a good thing.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.860]   But I've come to temper quite a bit
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.860]   on the need for being super hardcore
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.700]   about early childhood education.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.420]   And I'm starting to see the wisdom of simply waiting
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.500]   and waiting until your child is interested
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.500]   and is at an appropriate level for formal education.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.220]   Now, if we define the word education
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.660]   as things encompassing formal school subjects,
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.740]   I think we miss out on a great deal of the richness of life
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.060]   and the experience that a child needs.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.100]   In many ways, children are always learning.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.860]   They're always being educated.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.660]   And if we surround them with a rich environment
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.980]   filled with things that are good,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.180]   that are beautiful, that are true,
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.300]   that are inspiring, that are uplifting,
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.620]   then their education is happening all along the way,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.060]   but it's not necessarily happening
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.340]   through specific academic studies,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.900]   through specific book learning.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.180]   One of the challenges that you'll face
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.900]   if you're a young parent is, although you tell yourself,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.180]   "I don't need to compare my child to other people,"
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.100]   you can't help but do it.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.500]   And there's such an intense pressure on parenting
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.180]   and on parents that I think it's very easy to get uptight.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.460]   So-and-so is having such and such a milestone.
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.380]   So-and-so there is having such and such a milestone.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.500]   And our child is not.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.940]   What's wrong with our child?
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.620]   Now, we, of course, need to pay attention to our children,
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.300]   understand what's happening,
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.100]   but recognize that children develop differently.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.900]   Boys develop differently than girls.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.900]   One boy develops differently than another boy.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.500]   One girl develops differently than another girl.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.300]   Everyone develops differently.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.380]   And be willing to take some time and have patience.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.420]   When I was younger, I read the recommendations
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.660]   and books of educators who would talk about the value
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.060]   of waiting until a child is about seven
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.820]   to start formal academic studies.
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.740]   And I was always a little bit nervous about that position.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.980]   Seems to me that it'd be silly
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.660]   to waste several years of study
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.020]   if it can be achieved.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.580]   And so I filed that away in the back of my head as,
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.700]   okay, well, they're saying you shouldn't worry
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.740]   about things until age seven.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.820]   But I think probably that's a little bit too late.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.060]   And of course, in the system that most of us are part of
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.420]   where you have kindergarten and pre-kindergarten
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   is very heavily pushed.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.860]   And in fact, there's a big push among some people
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.020]   to make sure that not only is kindergarten mandated
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.220]   and paid for by the government,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.180]   but now pre-kindergarten is available
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.780]   and paid for by the government, et cetera.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.700]   So there was a big push in that direction
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.500]   that some people claim academic success because of it.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.620]   But I think I've come far more over onto the side
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.020]   of wait till the child is ready.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.140]   And I'm growing in confidence
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.060]   as I watch my own children develop.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.980]   It's difficult when you,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.140]   especially if you homeschool as we do,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.020]   if you homeschool, I think there's a tendency
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.860]   to feel a bit self-conscious
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.820]   because you know you're comparing yourself
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   and you're being compared to the government school system.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.060]   And because you're doing something
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.180]   that is still somewhat unorthodox,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.140]   I feel the desire to be a good representation
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.180]   of good results.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.620]   It's a little bit also of pressure
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.300]   if you're in any kind of public facing capacity.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.980]   And even though I don't talk about my children
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.220]   or put them in a public eye,
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.140]   I of course still feel a little bit of pressure
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.140]   of being in a public capacity.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.380]   And so there's this pressure to want to say,
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.100]   oh, I'm just gonna teach a child now
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.580]   and I've got to get these great results
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.380]   because if I don't, I'm gonna be judged harshly.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.620]   But of course to do that would be to not be focusing
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.420]   on the person's interests who matter,
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.460]   which is the child,
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.620]   'cause my children's job is not to make me look good.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.140]   My job is to care for them
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.140]   and do what's in their best interest,
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   to do what's good for them,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.340]   regardless of how it makes me look.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.940]   And I've also just realized and learned
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.420]   through a little bit of experience
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.700]   that it can lead to a lot of unnecessary frustration.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.080]   For example, with my eldest son,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.180]   we started working with him with reading
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.940]   and teaching him using a phonics method.
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.140]   And it just came to a lot of frustration.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.980]   And it was frustrating for mama,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.280]   it was frustrating for the child.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.660]   And so finally just said, okay, that's it.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.160]   And actually we were traveling around the country
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.060]   when we were doing it.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.780]   So we just said, that's it, there's no need for this.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.740]   We're not gonna try to...
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.340]   We weren't doing much for anybody who thinks
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.060]   that I'm brutalizing my children
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.620]   with three hours of instruction per day.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.460]   No, it wasn't much,
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.360]   but still it just wasn't clicking
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.060]   and it was frustrating for him.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.420]   And his parents looked and said, this isn't working.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.380]   So let's just stop.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.820]   And it was a convenient time to stop, et cetera.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.660]   Now on the flip side, he really seems to be skilled in math,
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.620]   grabs onto mathematical ideas much more.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.900]   And so I just kind of gently started working on mathematics
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.100]   and counting and numbers and things like that
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.960]   instead of reading.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.380]   And it led to far more happiness.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.540]   Now, recently, as he's come back to reading,
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.460]   his skill level is a little bit older,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.900]   has gone through the roof much, much faster.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.980]   Now this is not uncommon for boys.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.340]   It's fairly common for boys to learn to read
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.920]   at a later age than girls.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.380]   But yet it's encouraging to me as a parent
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.460]   to recognize that just because my child doesn't read at four
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.020]   that doesn't mean that they're doomed for failure.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.400]   I can wait and just wait until they're ready.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.720]   And waiting until they're ready
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.960]   seems like it can be a very important strategy.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.120]   So that would be, if I were to say
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.920]   what is the biggest change that has happened for me
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.960]   is I've grown increasingly confident
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.360]   that you can wait until a child is ready
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.100]   and that there is value in all the things they're learning.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.720]   So playing outside is valuable.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.680]   It's really important.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.160]   There's some interesting books
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.020]   that have been written about the value of play
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.840]   and how it in and of itself is formative.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.080]   I read these things and I just think,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.800]   okay, well, how do I apply this?
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.080]   But just learning to slow down and relax.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.440]   And I think that's probably a common experience.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.160]   As I have talked to parents in my peer group,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.560]   it seems like many of us
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.320]   have gone through a similar experience.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.680]   As I pull older parents that I know,
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.040]   it seems as though that's a common parenting experience.
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.080]   So I was probably a little bit blind to it
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.440]   back when I reported episode 77 of the show
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.580]   and the older parents are probably chuckling a little bit.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.860]   But that is what,
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.280]   that is, that's the biggest thing that I've changed on.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.680]   I'm growing more relaxed.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.800]   I'm growing more willing to just give time
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.040]   and let the child learn when the child is ready
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.800]   rather than try to kind of screw them
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.760]   into some preset curriculum.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.600]   Sounds ironic.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.000]   It sounds like it should be obvious
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.560]   because of course that's one of my frustrations
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.760]   with the government school system
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.120]   is that children are screwed into a set curriculum
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.880]   that doesn't account for the individual needs
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.080]   and interests of the child.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.000]   So it should be obvious to me that that's what I was doing.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.280]   But I was open to not doing that,
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.020]   but still I think I did have a little bit
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.160]   of unnecessary pressure there.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.840]   I'll talk about some influences
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.760]   that have been impressive to me
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.220]   and talk about some solutions
[00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.080]   as we talk about how to integrate them.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.240]   So the first thing is philosophy of education.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.940]   In my mind, the purpose of a child's education
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.740]   is multifaceted.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.540]   So there are a number of things,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.460]   and this is not a comprehensive list,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.860]   but there are a number of things that we want
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.620]   for our children in their educational process.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.120]   One of the first things that we want
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.920]   is character development.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.880]   So a child who has a strong and upright
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.800]   and virtuous character can succeed in almost any endeavor,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.680]   almost any activity,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.640]   whereas a child who has great book smarts,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.320]   but no character, is less likely to succeed.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.480]   If you look at the world around us
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.120]   and you look at the character of people around you
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.240]   that you see succeeding and failing,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.360]   I'm convinced that character development
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.260]   and instruction and virtue and moral virtue
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.260]   is more important than one specific aspect of book learning.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.680]   And so that's a major focus of a child's education
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.380]   has to be character development.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.480]   Now that's a little hard to try to think about
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.760]   how you do it,
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.720]   because character development is different
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.000]   than understanding math facts.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.960]   Math facts can just simply be drilled and memorized,
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.520]   but character development is much more a matter of example,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.120]   a matter of instruction, a matter of correction,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.920]   and a matter of practice, a matter of exercise and courage
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.080]   when you don't feel like it,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.800]   and learning how to behave uprightly
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.560]   in the face of difficult circumstances.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.840]   So I don't know how that can be put into a book format,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.940]   but because character instruction and character development
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.120]   is a primary goal of education,
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.360]   I think that is where environment makes a big, big difference.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.160]   One of the biggest influences on a child's behavior
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.520]   is going to be what they see modeled around them.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.400]   When I think back to my own childhood,
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.880]   one of the things that I'm acutely conscious of is
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.120]   whenever I, when I look back on some of the things
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.000]   that I'm embarrassed of or ashamed of,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.120]   times when I treated people unkindly,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   or I was rude and abusive in my behavior towards others,
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.560]   it was always due to peer pressure
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.240]   and to the involvement of people who were around me.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.120]   And there's things that I'm ashamed of.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.080]   But looking back, I can see how, you know,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.520]   the old saw bad company corrupts good morals
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.160]   is certainly true.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.520]   I think many of us, if we look back on the things,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.500]   times that we did things that were stupid,
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.360]   that could have led to physical harm or death even,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.440]   times that we just did things that were foolish
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   or that were hurtful towards other people,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.960]   often it wasn't something that we dreamed up
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.980]   in and of ourselves, just sitting on our bed at home,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.580]   thinking, how can I go out and be cruel to another child?
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.220]   It often came because we saw somebody else being cruel
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.360]   and we wanted to fit in,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.580]   or we saw somebody else practicing deviant behavior
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.900]   and we wanted to fit in.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.500]   And so with regard to character development,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.180]   in my mind, I think one of the most important things
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.580]   to that end is to surround the child
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.580]   with a positive moral example.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.340]   Hopefully that comes from my wife and me living out
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.180]   an example of positive moral virtue.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.620]   It comes in to be very important
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.380]   in terms of the influences that we allow into our home,
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.580]   making sure that they're filled with,
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.860]   that our home is filled with influences that are upright,
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.420]   that are moral, that are virtuous,
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.580]   that are inspiring, that are quality,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.340]   and being willing to set clear standards about those things.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.880]   Now, one of the things that,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.040]   one of the things that's been interesting
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.180]   is because my wife and I are fairly sensitive to this,
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.180]   it's amazing how much of even just common day
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.800]   children's literature,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.100]   the things that are relatively normal,
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.380]   common, inoffensive, traditional things,
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.380]   how much of it teaches wrong behavior,
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.220]   wrong actions, et cetera.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.500]   And it's been sobering to me, even as a parent,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.460]   to look at some of the things that I formerly consider
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.880]   to be fairly innocuous and recognize
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.480]   what a formative effect these things can have
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.620]   on the impressionable mind of a child.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.420]   So I think that's one of the primary goals
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.760]   of character development.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.440]   Another primary goal, sorry,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.380]   goals of education is character development.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.260]   Another primary goal of education, I think,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.780]   has to do with developing and fostering a love of learning.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.340]   As far as I can tell, a person who loves to learn
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.920]   can conquer any mountain that's placed in front of them
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.080]   because challenges and problems simply become,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.900]   well, just that, a challenge that can be learned around.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.060]   You know, there's that old song from Annie Oakley,
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.940]   "Anything you can do, I can do better.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.780]   "I can do anything better than you."
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.420]   And there's a measure of truth to that
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.720]   that I think is helpful and healthy for us to understand,
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.500]   that anything you can do, I can do,
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.480]   maybe not better, but I can also do.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.940]   Anything you can do, I can also do.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.880]   Now, obviously, there are limitations.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.360]   There are physical limitations.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.280]   There are certain specific things
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.620]   that are simply not going to be possible.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.620]   And I bristle at kind of cheesy, positive-sounding stuff
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.780]   where people lie to children and say,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.500]   "Yeah, you can do anything in the world."
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.760]   One of my cardinal rules is never lie to my children,
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.800]   no matter what, in any circumstance, for any reason.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.020]   I feel like that erodes the most important measure of trust
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.220]   between a parent and a child.
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.340]   A parent will, if my daddy will lie to me about that,
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.220]   what else is he lying to me about?
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.140]   So one of my rules, I'll never lie to my children.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.220]   But there is, and so feeding them with fluffy things,
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.180]   if you can do anything, is absurd.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.560]   You can't do anything.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.860]   But yet still, helping somebody to understand
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.060]   that you can do almost anything
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.420]   with if you develop the appropriate disciplines,
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.420]   exercise, develop the appropriate skills,
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.540]   if you have the basic natural traits needed for that thing,
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.620]   and you can at least do better.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.660]   And the point of saying things like that to a child
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.740]   is you can do better if you apply yourself
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.940]   and you really focus on it and you believe in yourself
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.260]   and you work hard at it than if you sit around moaning
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.900]   and groaning about how you can't do it.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.020]   That's the truth that needs to be conveyed.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.340]   And so I see that one of the primary goals of education
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.340]   is to help a child develop a lifelong love of learning.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.540]   As I look at the world around,
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.780]   it seems absurd to me to think that any one of us,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.180]   be it us a parent or a professional teacher
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.460]   or an administrator of some kind,
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.780]   it seems absurd to me to think
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.380]   that we can look at a four-year-old child
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.620]   and design for that child a course of study
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.660]   taking some 12 or 16 or 20 years
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.180]   that will properly equip that child
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.980]   for the world that exists
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.660]   to take 15 or 20 years from now
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.700]   if we're talking about things like knowledge.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.740]   I don't see how you and I could possibly know
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.700]   what our children will be facing 18 years from now.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.820]   How could we know?
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.820]   How do we know what the world is gonna look like
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.100]   at that point in time?
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.140]   And so there's no specific piece of knowledge
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.980]   or point of skill that we can specifically say,
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.780]   well, I'm gonna give this to my five-year-old
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.540]   or I'm gonna do this in third grade
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.780]   that we can be sure is going to be relevant
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.580]   when they graduate from high school
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.740]   or when they graduate from college.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   And so what we need to do is to give them disciplines
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.460]   and skills that will allow them
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.700]   to grapple with the world at as it is
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.460]   12 or 16 or 18 years from now.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.220]   Now, the tools for doing so
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.060]   are probably going to involve
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.980]   specific pieces of information,
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.260]   specific skills that are relevant today.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.300]   But we're not focusing so much
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.340]   on those specific bits of information
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.820]   that we can somehow teach them for success,
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.860]   but we're rather focusing on teaching them
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.900]   to acquire the bits of information.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.500]   And so in order for them to acquire the information,
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.340]   they need to love learning
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.580]   so that they will not be those who are left behind
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.060]   as the pace of change continues to increase.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.860]   From every metric that I can see,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.580]   we can expect throughout the rest of our lifetimes
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.420]   that the pace of change of our lives
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.860]   will continue to increase.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.260]   If you do a survey of the last 15 years,
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.500]   you can clearly see that, how the pace of life has picked up
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   and how many of our jobs and businesses and skills
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.940]   are quickly becoming obsolete.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.420]   And the only people who are going to thrive
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.980]   and prosper in the future
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.220]   are those who have the requisite character
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.860]   and the requisite skills
[00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.900]   where they can quickly acquire new specific applied skills
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.420]   or grasp new knowledge, et cetera,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.980]   that will allow them to stay competitive
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.020]   in an increasingly competitive world.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.260]   Those who don't have that skill will quickly fall behind.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.420]   And so I see the development of those skills
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.020]   as being the primary function
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.620]   of a child's educational process.
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.980]   So they need to teach them a love for learning.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.420]   The second thing that's closely associated
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.620]   is they need to have the skills of learning.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.220]   Now, as I see it, those skills of learning
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.340]   could be subdivided between what I will call,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.580]   for lack of a better word, hard skills,
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.180]   and maybe soft skills.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.180]   I would classify hard skills as things like
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.780]   reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.340]   That the basic skill of reading or basic literacy
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.820]   is a fundamental core skill of learning.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.940]   Certainly you can learn how to do some things
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.540]   by watching somebody do it and repeating it.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.100]   There are students who are very skilled with their hands
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.220]   who, for example, can watch somebody work a machine
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.180]   or use a knife or a lathe or some piece of equipment
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.940]   and can copy what they're doing.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.300]   But the basic skill is, for all of us,
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.380]   is going to be reading.
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.740]   That's the basic way that we learn.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.860]   Then writing is one of those basic skills of communication.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.980]   And writing is an effective way of developing thoughts
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.540]   and is an effective way of developing what you think.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.780]   The best way to understand what you actually think
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.060]   is to write it down.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.940]   And so in writing it down,
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.060]   you can actually grapple with the thoughts that you have.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.380]   You can understand if you believe what you think or not.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.460]   And so people who are good writers
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.180]   and who are focused on writing
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.340]   tend to be disciplined thinkers.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.580]   And thinking is one of those basic hard skills,
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.340]   but it's not a skill that's easily taught
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.540]   because you say, "Well, everybody thinks."
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.900]   No, some people think,
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.700]   but the majority of people who do think, think poorly.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.340]   This seems self-evident to me.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.180]   If you look at the world around you,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.100]   it's not hard to find many examples
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.460]   of people who don't think.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.060]   They don't think about the consequences of their actions.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.980]   They don't think about the philosophy behind their ideas.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.660]   They don't think about where they're going to be tomorrow
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.060]   or where they came from yesterday.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.980]   Many people simply don't think.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.740]   They love to be entertained, but they don't love to think.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.900]   And so thinking is important.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.500]   But thinking is only the baseline.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.300]   Now, the next question, the next level
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.260]   has to become good thinking, excellent thinking,
[00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.660]   disciplined thinking, critical thinking,
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.900]   where we can extract our thoughts from our heads,
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.060]   put them down on paper where we can see them
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.380]   and grapple with, is this really true?
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.820]   Is this really going to have this effect?
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.500]   And so that seems to be a subset to me
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.900]   of one of the more valuable things of writing is thinking.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.940]   And then arithmetic, math in and of itself
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.420]   is a separate language from almost anything else,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.820]   but yet in many ways, it's the language of the universe.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.260]   It's one of the most incredible languages to speak,
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.860]   but it's in many ways separate.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.540]   It's infused in everything from the tree
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.300]   sitting outside of my window
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.260]   to how you'd balance your checkbook
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.660]   and how you figure out what a compound
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.940]   rate of return calculation looks like.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.460]   But yet it's something that has to be studied separately,
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.460]   and it's a basic skill.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.100]   So reading, writing, and arithmetic are hard skills.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.620]   Now, I think there are many other skills,
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.580]   and I don't have a comprehensive list,
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   but skills of communication are important.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.020]   Being able to relate with others,
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   with empathy and with understanding,
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.620]   and with the skills of making friends
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.980]   and winning friends and influencing people.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.140]   Skills like that are deeply important.
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.020]   Soft skills such as goal setting.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.780]   I think one of the most crucial things that we can do
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.940]   to teach our children is how to set goals.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.500]   Majority of people don't set goals,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.900]   and the majority of people, of course,
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.740]   don't achieve the goals that they would set
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.260]   if they did sit down and set them.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.220]   But if they would set the goal,
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.180]   then they would probably achieve it.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.260]   So we're teaching a child how to set a goal.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.140]   And all of this wraps together with helping them
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.620]   develop the skills of learning.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.300]   Now, I can find some ways to teach the hard skills.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.860]   That is probably simple.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.660]   I don't yet know all of the tools to use
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.900]   to teach the soft skills.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.180]   Time will tell.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.940]   But I'm looking for them, and I'm watching them
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.140]   to see how are those soft skills being developed.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.700]   One way I think that the child can learn those skills
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.260]   is through academics.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.780]   And I believe that there is a real value in academics.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.900]   As you look at different educational philosophies,
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.620]   if you start to confront them,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.460]   you'll come across some very intelligent,
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.820]   experienced, and persuasive people
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.220]   who will write to you and communicate to you their thoughts
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.620]   on almost any philosophy.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.900]   And I find a number of them very persuasive.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.620]   So for example, there is a small but growing movement
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.140]   in the United States, and I think around the world,
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.660]   of what has come to be known as unschoolers, unschooling.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.220]   It's not a great term.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.260]   Some of the unschoolers have different ideas
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.180]   that they would like, different words
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.260]   that they would like to be dubbed as instead of that,
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.380]   because they don't even like the paradigm
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.140]   of school being the paradigm,
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.060]   and thus being the anti-school.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.380]   I'm sympathetic to that argument.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.140]   I usually use the term home education
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.620]   rather than homeschooling,
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.300]   because I prefer not to be labeled
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.180]   in the term of something that is so artificial as schooling.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.660]   But I do intermittently use the term homeschooling,
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.420]   because it simply is the common language.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.540]   So with all due respect to the unschoolers
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.760]   who don't like my use of the term,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.020]   I think it's a most widely understood and used term.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.900]   In my understanding, the basic philosophy
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.160]   of the unschoolers is this.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.540]   Children who are not spoiled or destroyed
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.480]   by forced, coerced schooling have a love of learning.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.060]   It's natural, it's intuitive, it's built into the child.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.140]   I think most of us who are parents would affirm that,
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.820]   that we see that our children love to learn.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.720]   And so as a child grows and develops,
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.960]   that child doesn't have to lose that love of learning.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.000]   They can just simply choose what they want to learn about.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.580]   And the child will probably,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.060]   at least with a little bit of guidance
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.900]   or a little bit of direction from the parent,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.420]   the child will probably be able to choose
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.780]   the things that are important to them
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.020]   based upon the interests they have
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.100]   or the problems they have in their life.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.980]   And then with a little bit of seeding by the parent,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.940]   where the parent exposes them to ways to learn, et cetera,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.620]   can learn about what they want to learn about.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.820]   And so you don't have to force onto your child
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.700]   a giant curriculum.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.440]   These are the 15 textbooks we're gonna use
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.360]   for the next 12 years,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.600]   and you've gotta have them done by May 1st.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   You can just allow your child to direct themselves,
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.080]   to direct their own learning.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.120]   Now, I find this philosophy very inspiring.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.620]   I find it inspiring because to me,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.280]   it seems that there's some level
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.240]   of it being intuitively right that I want to concede.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.280]   If you go back to the era
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.440]   before forced industrialized compulsory schooling,
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.680]   you find that most people did learn
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.480]   the things that they needed for life.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.620]   Now, they lived in a much simpler life, I think,
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.820]   but at the end of the day,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.480]   the children did learn the things that they needed for life.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.560]   And there were many methods of education
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.600]   that didn't involve even the one-room schoolhouse.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.980]   And most of the learning that was practical,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.320]   the one-room schoolhouse model
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.400]   just simply provided a basic education
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.100]   in reading, writing, arithmetic.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.360]   And then most of the learning took place outside of that.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.420]   And the child could choose what they were interested in.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.960]   And so this strikes me as intuitively right
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.940]   and intuitively good to understand.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.360]   I have seen some evidence of really impressive success.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.580]   If you see a child who's really interested in something
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.980]   and they're allowed to indulge that interest
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.520]   and they're given good materials,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.380]   it's really impressive what some young people
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.260]   can come up with in terms of their areas of interest.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.140]   And when I reflect on my own life,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.400]   my own memory of my childhood
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.860]   is that I pretty much don't remember
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.860]   anything that was forced on me,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.700]   but I do remember all the things that I was interested in.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.680]   And I always was interested in learning.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.200]   And I remember the things that I studied
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.500]   because I cared about them.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.900]   And I didn't have anyone tell me
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.180]   I had to go and study this certain thing,
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.740]   but all the stuff I was forced to do
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.380]   by school curriculum, et cetera,
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.060]   I've pretty much forgotten.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.620]   I think of marine biology.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.340]   I took a marine biology course or a chemistry course,
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.820]   and I didn't care about marine biology.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.060]   I didn't care about chemistry.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.660]   And so I remember relatively nothing.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.140]   I could name probably half the elements
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.100]   on the periodic table.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.340]   And beyond that, I don't know that I have any knowledge
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.940]   of chemistry whatsoever.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.500]   I don't know anything that I learned in marine biology.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.420]   And so you look back and you calculate the time
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.940]   and you say, what a waste that was
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.980]   to spend all those hours in a class
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.700]   when I could have been doing something that I cared about
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.740]   and actually remember those things today.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.260]   My concerns, however, with unschooling
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.620]   primarily relate to, or primarily twofold.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.700]   They are, number one, character.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.260]   I really get concerned about character development.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.540]   And how do you help a child to do hard things
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.140]   so that they develop disciplines like persistence
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   and the willingness to keep working
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.620]   in the face of adversity
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.540]   if you're just simply indulging the whims of the child?
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.220]   In the same way that I'm not about to let my child
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.860]   eat ice cream and cotton candy all day, every day,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.940]   rather I'm going to feed my children healthy food,
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.500]   it seems like the same risk could be there
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.740]   with regard to unschooling.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.140]   I think that risk might be able to be moderated
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.700]   by maintaining a proper influence.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.340]   So if in your home you don't have any ice cream
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.780]   or cotton candy or sugar of any kind,
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.860]   and the child gets used to only having good foods
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.140]   available to them,
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.820]   then they're probably going to make better choices
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.180]   and choose to eat food that is available
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.740]   and be happy with that.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   In the same way, I think that can happen
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.340]   with regard to the intellectual diet of a child.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.660]   If your home is free of cotton candy and ice cream
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.260]   and is filled with good solid materials,
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.060]   then I think the child could probably indulge their interests
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:28.580]   and wind up in quality environments.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.900]   In our household, we've worked hard to try to do that.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.840]   It's not easy, it's a lot of work.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.140]   Some of the weird things we do,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.260]   we don't have any screens in the house
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.020]   that are available to the children.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.940]   The only screens in the house is my wife
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:42.780]   and my computers and our phones.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.300]   And we work really, really hard
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.220]   to never be on them around the children.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.860]   Now, ebbs and flows.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.260]   I think recently, I've been on my screen
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.980]   more than I should be.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.340]   And of course, I make a living
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.620]   staring at my computer screen.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.560]   So you wish for things to be better,
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.860]   but we've not introduced, we don't have a TV,
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:03.980]   we don't watch movies,
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.240]   the kids don't have entertainment devices or phones,
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.340]   things like that.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.420]   I'm not convinced that's the best thing forever.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.660]   I think that there is a time
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.240]   where those things should be introduced.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.820]   But what I have watched is over the years,
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.980]   I have watched my children's natural curiosity develop.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.820]   And I've watched that in absence of cotton candy,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.980]   in absence of YouTube, which I'm not arguing
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.580]   that there couldn't be a huge amount
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.500]   of useful information available from YouTube.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.400]   If I had had YouTube when I was a kid,
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.980]   I don't know what, I don't know if it would have been
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.180]   a good thing or a bad thing,
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.200]   but certainly with my interests,
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.540]   I would have been doing nothing but watching YouTube videos.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.920]   So I'm not denying that there can be some things
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.920]   that are really interesting.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.020]   And I guess to say no screens,
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.420]   I did show my children a video
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.340]   of the SpaceX launch the other day.
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.320]   We took them up to Cape Canaveral
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.260]   for the first big SpaceX heavy launch,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.100]   which was pretty cool.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.600]   If you get a chance to go to one of the SpaceX
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.960]   heavy launches, you should do it.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.500]   It's pretty spectacular to be there
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.340]   and to watch it take off
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.740]   and then to watch the rocket boosters come back
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.700]   and land is pretty cool.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.720]   It's worth making an effort to do.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.900]   So we took them to that and we showed them a video of it
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.580]   so they could understand more of what was happening.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.040]   So it's not as though there's not a place for that.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.400]   I think there really is.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.640]   But what I observe and my theory is
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.380]   that things like reading are hard usually for a young child,
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.700]   whereas things like video are easy
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.540]   because there's no imagination needed
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.160]   for a child when they're watching video.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.600]   They already have all of the words
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.140]   because they've learned how to speak.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.580]   They just haven't learned how to read.
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.760]   And so I'm thankful and gratified to see
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.340]   that in absence of cotton candy and ice cream,
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.740]   I'm watching my children start to interact
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.220]   and engage with a lot of reading
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.680]   and a lot of things that are pretty challenging.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.560]   And I'll watch carefully over the next couple of years
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.460]   and see how that goes.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.840]   But as I see it, I need to really successfully cement
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.300]   the skills and the love of reading
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.300]   before ever bringing in the cotton candy for the brain,
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.880]   which is the screen.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.540]   So my concern with unschooling is
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.500]   how do you get that character development
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.820]   if the child is just simply allowed to go
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.380]   with their own whims and their own wishes all day long?
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.100]   It's not that I deny that the interests
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.320]   that you have are important.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.740]   Certainly they are.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   We all have interests that are important.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.780]   But I do deny that you can always just do
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.220]   what you feel like.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.140]   And that being the highest and best good.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.060]   I deny that vigorously.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.100]   In my own life, there are many times
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.840]   where the things that I'm most proud of
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.580]   are things that don't feel good.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.740]   They don't feel nice.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.860]   This seems to me like a...
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:53.060]   When I watch friends and I study stories
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:58.060]   of people who succeed in life and who fail in life,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.540]   it seems like these things are the most important.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.860]   Knowing how to do something that's hard.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.300]   So whether it's loving your wife
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.700]   when you don't feel like it,
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.780]   or working with your child,
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.860]   or rocking the baby in the middle of the night
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.300]   when you don't feel like it,
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.900]   or submitting to a boss who's very difficult
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.300]   when you don't feel like it.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.340]   This matters.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.560]   And so I don't think that academics
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.500]   are the only way to teach it.
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.740]   I think there are many ways to teach it.
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.140]   At a young age, of course,
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.500]   I try to use putting away the toys to teach it,
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.460]   or doing hard things that you don't feel like to teach it.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.140]   It doesn't have to be academics.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.580]   But what tool do I have other than academics?
[00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:40.300]   Some students and children seem to learn this
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.300]   with things like sports,
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.920]   learning how to do five more suicides
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.540]   when you thought you couldn't,
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.740]   learning how to do an extra workout
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   when you thought you couldn't,
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.420]   or whatever the reality is.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.780]   So maybe there's an involvement there for sports
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.060]   or for working with their parents.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.860]   There are many things that I think could be applied to that.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.420]   But for most of us,
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.740]   where we live in an academic context that,
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.500]   or sorry, a societal context
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.340]   in which academics are important,
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.580]   it seems to me that academics
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.380]   is one of the best tools that we have
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.380]   for challenging a person.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.460]   And at the moment, it's my opinion
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.900]   that we can challenge a child
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.140]   and encourage them to do hard things
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:25.380]   without their losing their love of learning.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.100]   So I think that's one of my concerns with unschooling
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.260]   is how is character going to be developed
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.820]   and doing hard things?
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.540]   In addition, my concern is that we live in a society
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.580]   where academic prowess really pays dividends
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.580]   for those who have a high cognitive ability.
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.820]   And if my child didn't have a high cognitive ability,
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.780]   I don't wanna stress them with academics.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.580]   I want them to learn the basics of literacy and numeracy,
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.140]   but I'm not gonna stress a child of low cognitive ability
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.220]   with trying to say you've got to get a PhD in chemistry.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.860]   But we live in a society
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.380]   where those who have good academic qualifications
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.380]   tend to get better results in many areas than others.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.300]   And so I'm concerned that if we just allow a child
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.540]   to only do the things that they feel like doing,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.700]   and we don't dig in with other things that are challenging,
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.620]   that they're not gonna get great results.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.660]   Those are my concerns with unschooling.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.500]   Now, on the flip side,
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.740]   we could go over to a very rigorous academic environment,
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.660]   whatever you would use to describe that word.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.980]   And this is where my own personal natural inclination is,
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:37.980]   especially as a parent,
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.660]   is I want my child to go into a world
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.220]   of rigorous academics.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.860]   I want them to be the valedictorian of their class.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.300]   I want them to have a PhD by the time they're 22.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.180]   This is kind of my natural extremist personality
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:54.180]   that says, "Let's move you over into this hardcore world."
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.580]   The problem I have here is multifold, multifaceted, however.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.820]   First, I don't think that rigorous academics
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.820]   necessarily leads to life success.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.700]   And I think that it's very possible
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.420]   that somebody could be happy and successful and content
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.500]   and not have been involved
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.900]   in a rigorous academic environment.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.380]   Although I can see that something
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.900]   like having a college degree
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.260]   certainly seems to make a difference
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.820]   on the unemployment rate
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.860]   that a person could expect to experience,
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.100]   or perhaps the earning ability
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.660]   that a person could expect to have,
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.100]   I don't see that a college degree
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:31.380]   necessarily leads to greater happiness.
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.420]   In fact, I bet there's probably some way
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.460]   we could find some data to prove the opposite.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.660]   I've never looked into it all that much,
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.620]   but I don't wanna look at my children and say,
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.980]   "You've gotta get a master's degree or a PhD,
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.060]   "or I'm gonna disown you."
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.580]   Like, that doesn't seem to be right.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.740]   And especially in the world of the future,
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.660]   I think that although I think something
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.740]   like a college degree or a high school transcript
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.900]   will be continued to be important,
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.260]   and I'll encourage my children
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.700]   who are interested and capable in that direction,
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.300]   I don't think it'll be nearly as important
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.220]   as it was in the past.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.060]   I think we see this ship turning a little bit.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.820]   And it's certainly not necessary
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.620]   to be a productive member of society,
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.940]   and it's certainly not necessary
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.140]   to be able to support yourself and your family.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.620]   If you're a motivated, disciplined person
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.980]   who has an interest and skills developed in a certain area.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.940]   What I'm doing right now is not something
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.060]   that could be screened
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.740]   as something requiring a college degree.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   Many of the people that I would hire in my company,
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.380]   I don't care if they have a college degree,
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.820]   I care if they have certain skills,
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.380]   and those skills may or may not be taught
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.860]   in a college classroom.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.380]   Most of the time, they're not.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.220]   And I think we see kind of the silliness
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.940]   of the college system of the past going away.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:45.300]   I don't think that means that college is worthless.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.700]   What I do think it means is I have actually changed
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.100]   my personal tune on college
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:53.260]   to go away from a measure of career practicality
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.140]   towards some of the more traditional,
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.620]   older points of college.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.780]   When I went into college,
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.780]   I measured my college degree in the basis of career.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.880]   I studied business because I wanted to,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.980]   I wanted to become successful in business.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:11.940]   I wanted to be a Fortune 500 corporate CEO.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.820]   That was my goal.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.340]   And so I studied finance, and then I studied marketing,
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.740]   and I ultimately graduated
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.820]   with a degree in international business.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.880]   But when I reflect on that today,
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:26.980]   one of my biggest regrets of my college experience
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.820]   is that I didn't prioritize the life of the mind
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:35.820]   with regard to philosophy and studying classics, et cetera.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.800]   I recently had an interaction with one of my honors teachers
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.260]   when I was in college, and I talked to them.
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.420]   I said, I talked to him about how I wished
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.540]   I hadn't dropped out of the honors program.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.180]   My freshman year of college, I was in the honors program,
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.540]   which at the university that I went to
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.260]   was very much kind of on the classical education model,
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.100]   reading many of the great books
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.460]   and kind of working through the history
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.560]   of Western civilization in a very robust
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.740]   and challenging way.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.740]   But what happened was prior to my attendance at that school,
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:12.580]   always previous, the honors people
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.520]   who had been accepted into the honors program
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.820]   had received an additional scholarship from the school
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.800]   for being in the honors program.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.380]   So I applied for and was accepted to the honors program.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.840]   But the year that I was a freshman in college,
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.100]   the school canceled that scholarship.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.500]   And at the time, I was working three jobs
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.020]   to kind of work my way through school,
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.140]   and I really wasn't enjoying the honors curriculum
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:39.500]   all that much, reading all these old books
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.580]   written by Roman and Greek people,
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.260]   and I just wasn't that interested in it.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.780]   And so I dropped out of the honors program
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.600]   after my first year.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.440]   I didn't see any point.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.660]   So I graduated with honors, big deal, who cares?
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:50.620]   I don't care.
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.340]   And I went into just a normal program.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.380]   But then a year or two after I did that,
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:57.900]   they brought back the honors scholarship,
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.500]   which was a substantial scholarship.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.580]   And so I was in it for the money,
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.740]   and then I dropped out because they weren't giving the money
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   and I never went back,
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.060]   'cause it's the kind of curriculum
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.620]   that it builds on itself each year
[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.660]   of freshman, sophomore, junior, senior year.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.940]   It's a building curriculum.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.260]   So you can't come in in the senior year
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.740]   and expect to have reasonable conversations
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.320]   with your classmates.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.640]   It's one of the few regrets I have from college.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   Today, I wish I hadn't studied business.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.620]   I don't see, although I learned some things,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.820]   I don't see really any relevant training
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.780]   other than perhaps accounting.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.260]   I don't see much relevant training
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.740]   from my business degree to my life now.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.340]   And my accounting classes were all at 8 a.m.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.380]   I slept through half of them,
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.820]   and I just got my way through.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:44.940]   I don't remember what grades I got,
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.820]   but I got my way through 'cause I'm good at taking tests.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.820]   And today, I learned a lot.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.380]   Just picking up an accounting textbook and reading it
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:54.500]   is a lot more useful to me
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.740]   than taking those accounting classes.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.140]   And I bet it probably would have been in those days too.
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.140]   But what I wish I'd studied
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.500]   is I wish I'd been in the honors curriculum.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.020]   Frankly, I probably wish I'd gotten a degree
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.660]   in something like philosophy
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.500]   or one of those liberal arts areas of focus
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.980]   because I spend far more of my time today
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.100]   thinking about philosophy and reading philosophy
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.620]   and looking at the world around me
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.080]   and trying to analyze it in philosophical terms
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.740]   than I do thinking about anything
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.400]   that I studied in business.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.820]   Someday, I think I'll probably go get a PhD in philosophy.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.800]   Maybe after I retire and my kids are grown,
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.580]   I'll go and study philosophy.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.100]   But I don't know how to recommend that to people
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.300]   because it's just, that's where I'm at right now
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:40.060]   is I don't see the academic college degree
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:42.080]   as being the key thing of my success.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.420]   Now, I learned a lot through school,
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.540]   built some good relationships.
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.220]   I learned a lot through the process of it.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.980]   And so in that way, academic study can be the catalyst
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.620]   for developing those character skills
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.020]   that lead to greater success.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.140]   But I don't see that as the specific knowledge
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.340]   of certain things that are super important.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.900]   So my bent is towards emphasizing the rigorous academics,
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.280]   but I see a number of problems with that for children.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.180]   The first problem can be that question of interest.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.620]   If a child's not interested in academics,
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.000]   then is it really the best thing to just hammer them,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.940]   hammer them, hammer them,
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.480]   that you've gotta be academically great?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.680]   I can see both sides of that.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.860]   I wish today, I wish that somebody had convinced me
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.620]   to stay in the honors program when I was in college.
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:28.500]   I wish it had happened, but it didn't.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.620]   And no one came around and explained to me
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.020]   the lifelong impact of a liberal arts education.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.140]   I scoffed at it in favor of just wanting
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.460]   a business education, not a liberal arts education.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.320]   I was wrong.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.440]   But I don't know if the same thing applies to children.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.880]   Is it really important to hammer the child?
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.380]   Maybe.
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.420]   The other thing that I get concerned of
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.260]   is there is a cost to everything.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.420]   There is a cost to rigorous, rigorous academics.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.260]   And so a child who's all their time
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.540]   is spent reading the classics
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.580]   may also be a child who's not developing other interests
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.460]   or who's not developing other hobbies
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.260]   or engaging in projects
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.500]   that are just of their own personal interest,
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.140]   programming an app or developing a skill
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.640]   with making knives or these kinds of things.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.900]   And so those things seem to me
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.980]   like they could suffer at the hands of rigorous academics.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.140]   So I'm caught personally between these two schools
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.460]   of admiring certain things from each of them.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.840]   So let me give you some of the inspirations
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.300]   that have been impressive to me,
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.860]   and then you can consider them.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.740]   First, I do think there is a lot to be said
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.060]   for the value of a child's interests,
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:49.580]   child-directed learning based upon their interests.
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.740]   As long as the parent is making sure
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.180]   that the house is not full of cotton candy,
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.740]   and as long as the parent is working hard
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.340]   to expose their child to a diverse range
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.100]   of options and abilities,
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.120]   I think a child should be encouraged to study
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:05.700]   or to be engaged in the things that they're interested in.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.100]   I don't see how it could be denied
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.900]   that when a child is interested in something
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.880]   that they have a higher degree of probability
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.780]   of engaging with it and success.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   And I don't think there's a problem
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.220]   with being interested in something
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.220]   for only a short amount of time.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.020]   One of the things that I can see in my own childhood
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.820]   is I had a great number of interests,
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.820]   but often only for a short amount of time.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.500]   At the time, I thought that was a bad thing.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.780]   I thought I had to stick with everything
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.980]   until I mastered it.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.940]   Today, I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.660]   I just engaged with something until I lost interest
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.420]   and moved on to the next thing.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.420]   And so I find the approach of child-directed learning
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.080]   to be very persuasive, but not complete.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.140]   Then on the flip side, perhaps the formal philosophy
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.420]   that has been most engaging to me and to my wife
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.340]   or most impressive would be the writings
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.140]   and philosophies of Charlotte Mason.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:05.380]   Charlotte Mason, I'm not sure that she did a great job
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.540]   writing her books.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.020]   That's why some modern writers have gone back
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.340]   and reworked some of her material
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.260]   to focus in on her methods
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.940]   without necessarily reading through her multiple books
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.840]   that she wrote on education.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.300]   But Charlotte Mason, I think more than anybody,
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.240]   put together a comprehensive vision
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.220]   of what a well-educated child looks like.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.460]   And I find her ideas to be very inspiring, very stimulating.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.140]   And it's hard for me to find disagreement
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.120]   with many of her philosophies.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.980]   Perhaps the most influential,
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.380]   her focus on living books versus textbooks.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.340]   I have almost nothing good to say about textbooks,
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.120]   but living books, I have a lot to say.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.580]   Some of her practices of the little techniques and things,
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.140]   you can go and dig into the Charlotte Mason methodology
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:54.980]   if you're interested.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.580]   There's a robust world of Charlotte Masonites online
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.180]   with podcasts, blogs, et cetera.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.140]   So I think Charlotte Mason is perhaps
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.380]   of the philosophers of education that I've come across,
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.060]   the most inspiring.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.620]   And then the third resource
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.500]   that has been very inspiring to me
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.820]   was the experience of Art Robinson.
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.800]   Art Robinson was a man,
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.200]   he and his wife had six young children.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.080]   He and his wife were both PhD research scientists
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.480]   when she struck an unusual illness and died suddenly
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.240]   when their youngest baby was about six months old.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.920]   And he was left as a committed homeschooler by philosophy.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.880]   He and his wife were committed
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.640]   that they were gonna homeschool their children
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.460]   by philosophical and religious conviction.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:42.720]   But he was left as a single father with six young children
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.620]   and the need to work as a full-time research scientist.
[00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:49.500]   And so he went on and he figured,
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.620]   he enlisted the children in the help
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:54.460]   and he successfully homeschooled his children.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.340]   Now you can read about it.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.980]   There's a website that's curated in his name
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.860]   at robinsoncurriculum.com.
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.740]   He sells a school curriculum.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.420]   I don't see any reason to buy the curriculum
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.380]   other than to read his course of study document.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:09.700]   But at that, you can read some of his essays on education.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.720]   And in essence, his educational system with his children
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.840]   was extremely simple.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.280]   What he required, first they taught basic reading
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.840]   and arithmetic and penmanship, basic writing.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.520]   And then what he required his children to do
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.620]   was every day they had to do mathematics.
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:27.640]   They would start their day
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.460]   with about an hour and a half of mathematics.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.280]   And what he used with his children
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.600]   was the Saxon math curriculum.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.180]   First thing that they learned was they memorized
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.600]   to excellence all of the math facts,
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.440]   the addition, subtraction, multiplication
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.080]   and division tables by rote memory.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.280]   Then after that, they started in on Saxon 5-4
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.840]   and they worked Saxon math every day themselves
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   all the way through from Saxon 5-4 through calculus
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.220]   without help.
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:53:00.440]   So he refused to help his children with learning math.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.520]   And his philosophy on this was a few fold.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.120]   First, of course, he had a good material.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.540]   Saxon was designed to be taught in a classroom environment,
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.400]   but the teaching and education,
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.280]   the presentation in the books
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.560]   were sufficient for his children to teach themselves
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.880]   and then to go back and figure out their problem.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.280]   And so he required them to teach themselves
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.480]   so that they learned that they could teach themselves
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.880]   when they were having problems.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.160]   If they didn't know how to do something,
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.600]   he wouldn't answer their question and make it easy on them.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.760]   He sent them back to the book
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.400]   and they had to work at it until they got it.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   And as a parent, he held that discipline to say,
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.720]   you have to work at it till they got it.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:39.220]   Well, his commentary as a father of adult children
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:41.980]   is that in and of itself,
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.700]   transformed the lives of his children
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.180]   because they learned how to do something hard
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.180]   and they learned that they could teach themselves
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:50.340]   anything they wanted to learn.
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.500]   They didn't need another teacher.
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.420]   They could teach themselves with the right book
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:54.780]   and the right effort.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.900]   And then by starting with math every day,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.640]   with an hour and a half of math every day,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.380]   they started with something hard,
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.700]   which taught them discipline,
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.780]   taught them to engage their brains.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.320]   Then after math, he laid out for his children
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.080]   and his wife had actually compiled
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.160]   the list of resources prior to her death.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.800]   They laid out a specific reading curriculum
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.160]   of a broad array of books,
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.540]   starting with simple child level novels and stories,
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.000]   up to advanced philosophical, political works, et cetera.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.960]   And he ordered this reading in terms of easy reading
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.680]   through difficult reading.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   And they were required to read their way systematically
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.960]   through a list of books.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.560]   And then the third component was every day
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.740]   they had to write a small essay.
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.920]   I think it was a page a day
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.400]   and they had to write something every day.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.980]   And then he would every day correct that essay.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.220]   Now, from the perspective of academic accolades,
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:52.220]   I think he has gotten great success with that methodology.
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:55.320]   With his six children going from memory here,
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.840]   something like four of them have PhDs in various fields,
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.000]   from a PhD in chemistry to a veterinary,
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.360]   one is a veterinarian, things like that.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.880]   And most of his children
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.880]   clapped out of the first two years of college
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.440]   simply by taking tests.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:12.120]   And the simplicity of that was very strong.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.020]   By the time his children were old enough,
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.760]   after years of doing sacks and math,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.960]   they would all go through calculus
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   and they would study physics and chemistry.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   As a scientist, he has personal strong feelings
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.880]   that science should come after mathematics
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.420]   rather than trying to be taught concurrently.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.600]   I am not qualified to affirm or deny that position,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.740]   but I do know that my attempt at learning science
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.040]   concurrent with mathematics didn't produce much.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.560]   And I probably would have learned more
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.260]   if I had gone through calculus
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.100]   and then gone and done physics and chemistry
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.400]   as his children did.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:50.840]   But his children, so when it came time to clep tests,
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.320]   basically he would have his children say,
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:57.120]   here is the chemistry clep exam preparation manual,
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.280]   take it, read it, they would read the book,
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.800]   and then they would go take the test.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.040]   And then for whatever other subjects were,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.120]   they would read the book and go take the test.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.360]   I can see in myself that that's the kind of system
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.800]   that I would have thrived on
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   if I had been presented to me in college.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.820]   The way that I did my master's degree in financial planning
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.760]   was exactly that.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.480]   Here's a textbook, read the textbook, take the test.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.460]   It was easy for me.
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.320]   I read the textbook,
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.960]   the textbook teaches what you need to know,
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:22.880]   you read, you take the test.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.920]   There's no need for a teacher.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.440]   There's no need for the waste of time
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.280]   of sitting around for classroom lectures.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.080]   I never understood the reason why in college
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.160]   I would buy all these expensive textbooks.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.740]   And then the teacher takes 10 pages out of this chapter
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.780]   and six pages out of that, et cetera.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.680]   And I still don't understand it.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.480]   It seems like a total waste of time.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.080]   If the textbook is what's needed to learn the subject,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.360]   give me the textbook and I'll read it
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.960]   and not waste my time with a lecture.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.560]   If we need a lecture, then give me the lecture,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.400]   but don't duplicate what's in the textbook
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.860]   and just do the same thing for me.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.600]   I recognize there may be different learning styles,
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.640]   et cetera, but I find it annoying to have that.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.240]   The best use of a college classroom that I can determine
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.320]   is something like a law school classroom
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.140]   or perhaps a philosophy classroom
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.800]   where you do your reading out of class
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.000]   and then you come together and you talk about the ideas.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.600]   Not the answers to simple things that are found in textbooks
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.680]   but the ideas.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.880]   And you focus your class time on reasoning together
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.440]   and debating together, et cetera.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.440]   That seems to me to be a more useful use of classroom time.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.920]   So back to Robinson Curriculum, his children went on,
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   they got undergraduate degrees, master's degrees,
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.760]   and many of them, again, PhDs, but very young ages.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.880]   So very impressive academic credentials.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.560]   How much of that is due to the example
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.100]   of their father and mother
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.760]   versus their school environment, I don't know.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.600]   It seems like the example of the father and mother,
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:46.160]   if you come from a father and mother who both have PhDs,
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.960]   would probably be a heavy influence on you.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:54.040]   But I think there is something to his curriculum.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.080]   So in many ways, at the moment,
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.240]   I basically think that a hybrid of these two models
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.980]   is probably the best solution.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.520]   Now, I reserve the right to watch my children
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.580]   and see how they develop,
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.840]   see what they're responding well to
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.040]   and what they're not responding well to.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.960]   But in my mind, really the only thing
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.680]   that a child has to learn
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.960]   is reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.200]   Reading is learned by reading.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.100]   So we have to accomplish basic literacy,
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.600]   teach the child to phonetically sound out words,
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:28.040]   and then fill the child's hands with quality,
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.800]   level-appropriate reading material,
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.320]   and ensure that they read it.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.800]   Writing is learned through writing,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.320]   and it is influenced by good reading.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.680]   Good readers tend to be better writers.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.000]   Being a reader, I never failed a spelling test in my life.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.560]   I didn't understand why people had to study spelling
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.400]   or study grammar.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.200]   It just becomes natural to you.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.680]   It comes naturally to you. (laughs)
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.520]   If you're raised in a household
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.040]   where your parents speak with proper grammar
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.200]   and where you read proper grammar,
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.600]   there's little need to do much more than that.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.840]   But writing is a discipline that needs to be encouraged.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.080]   So reading and writing.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.900]   And then arithmetic seems to me
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:09.240]   like an important language
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.800]   that has to be studied separately.
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.160]   My biggest beef with the Charlotte Mason methodology
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.720]   is that it's extremely teacher-intensive.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.000]   It's largely teacher-led and teacher-directed.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.280]   I see the importance of that at a young age.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.540]   I don't think it's right to toss a six-year-old in
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:31.080]   and say, "Go in and do six hours' worth of school today."
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.840]   But I don't see any reason why a 12-year-old
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.800]   can't have the necessary self-discipline
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.920]   to sit at their desk and do three or four hours
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.760]   of good, solid work.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.640]   One of Robinson's things was he always made sure
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.400]   that he had his desk work to do at the same time
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.760]   that his children had their desk work.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.600]   And so they would come in
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.120]   and they think they would probably do four hours
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.680]   of schoolwork a day.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.480]   And he had a classroom where he had his desk
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.280]   where he was working on his work quietly.
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.740]   The child would come in, work on their work quietly alone.
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:57.720]   And then when they were done for the day,
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.240]   they could go and do whatever other things they needed,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.220]   whether it was their chores, their interests,
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:05.220]   their hobbies, et cetera.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.360]   So my issue with Charlotte Mason,
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.800]   the heavy teacher-intensiveness seems difficult
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.680]   to put up with over time.
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.640]   And the Robinson curriculum seems to me to be,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:20.120]   I really appreciate that self-directed attention
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   and the ability and the requirement of the child
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.480]   to be self-directed.
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.400]   My children are as yet too young for that.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.140]   And I think that it's important that as a parent,
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.200]   we not be a slave to any one philosophy,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.960]   but that we be open to see what's working
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.320]   and what's not working.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.040]   But those are the influences
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.840]   that have been most influential upon me.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.280]   Now, looking at the future,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.520]   I think where we'll wind up
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.760]   is probably doing some combination of these things,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.600]   focusing on reading, writing, and arithmetic
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.600]   as the curriculum that is required of our children.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.920]   Reading the curriculum or the list of books
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.400]   that we will require our children to read
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.540]   will align heavily with the Charlotte Mason philosophy
[01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.160]   of living books.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.080]   And it will be quality literature
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.920]   that engages the mind, engages the heart,
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.520]   and it leads the mind to think on lofty things,
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.040]   things that are good and virtuous, et cetera.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.240]   I do think that the Charlotte Mason tactic
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   or tool of narration of having the child,
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.360]   which is for the uninitiated,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.840]   it is narration is simply having the child talk about
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.580]   in an early age and then write about what they're reading
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.800]   so that you can understand what's going on in their head
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.440]   and so they can articulate their thoughts.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.560]   I think that narration is a natural result of good books.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.600]   And I observe that my children narrate the books
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.520]   that we read fairly naturally.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.120]   We do a lot of out loud reading together,
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.160]   and they quickly,
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.320]   after we finish reading a passage in a book,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.700]   they quickly wanna go, I do a lot of the reading,
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.280]   my wife does too, but I do a lot of it,
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.480]   they quickly wanna go and narrate to their mother
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.360]   and tell her what happened in the book.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:04.720]   And so I think that seems natural.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   And then the natural output for writing
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.780]   seems to be that basic narration.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.960]   In the early years, however,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.280]   I don't see how this applies to kindergarten age students,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.960]   first grade or necessarily second grade.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.640]   It seems like there's probably a jump
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.800]   somewhere around second or third grade level.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.920]   So what we're doing right now is I work a lot
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.720]   with my eldest on math facts.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.540]   Most math facts seem to wait till later,
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.420]   but since he has an appreciation and an ability in math,
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:34.040]   I've been feeding that.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.160]   And then we're using a basic,
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.920]   currently an Abeka workbook
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.560]   that helps with some mathematics and some penmanship.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.680]   One of the unusual things that we're doing thus far
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.920]   is we have chosen to not teach our children thus far,
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.080]   at least, to write using manuscript,
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.160]   but to start with cursive writing from the beginning.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.040]   That's a fairly unusual, and I don't think it's a key thing,
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.080]   but it's a fairly unusual thing to do.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.640]   A couple of years ago, I never thought of it.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.920]   I was taught to print with manuscript
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.600]   and then later to write with cursive.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.760]   But I did observe that most people that I know
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.040]   who learned to write cursive
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.840]   don't really use cursive all that much,
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.920]   and they go back to their printing.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.160]   I came across an essay on this position,
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.320]   or several essays, where people were talking about
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.520]   the value of simply starting a child with cursive.
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.020]   The flowing lines of cursive are better
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:29.480]   for the child's physical ability with their hands
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.160]   than are the sharp points and straight lines of printing,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.760]   and that you can just simply start with cursive,
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.920]   and if they want to learn to print later on, that's fine,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.800]   but there's nothing that keeps a child
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.120]   from learning how to write in cursive
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.240]   from the very beginning.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.520]   I thought the position was influential,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.720]   and it's one of the reasons why we chose
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.840]   to use an Abeka curriculum, because Abeka,
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.840]   you can purchase all of their early-stage curricula
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.720]   in either in manuscript or in cursive.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.700]   So I personally don't think we'll stick with that
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.480]   much beyond these first few years,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.140]   but what I am satisfied with seeing
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.520]   is I see an appreciation and an increasing understanding
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.760]   and memorization of math facts happening.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.740]   I see my eldest grappling with the concepts
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:13.320]   and applying what he's learning to the world around.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.860]   I see him learning how to sit at a desk and work on it.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:17.680]   I have to concede that the colorful workbooks
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.840]   and whatnot probably do make that more fun,
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.280]   and I see him developing the skill of working alone.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.760]   By having a workbook, it puts very little stress
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.760]   on me or his mother to say to him, "You have to do this,"
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.280]   but rather he can read the instructions.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.160]   He does still need some help
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.160]   with reading the instructions, and beyond that,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.040]   but he can learn and sit and work at his desk for an hour,
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.800]   and that seems to be working well,
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.680]   and then beyond that, of course,
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.740]   trying to focus on other things that are learning,
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.460]   whether it's physical movement and activity exercise,
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.120]   just simply playing, music, construction, et cetera,
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.020]   beyond that.
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:57.320]   That's where I'm at currently.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.120]   Pivot to the last couple of topics.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.760]   Is homeschooling the best for everyone
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.120]   who is going to pull their child out of a government school?
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.260]   I don't think so.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.580]   I don't think so, and I get conflicted on this
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.760]   because a lot of it has to do with what you have access to.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.200]   On the one hand, homeschooling has tremendous benefits.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.180]   I can't think of a way that a child
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:22.280]   could have a better personalized education
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.040]   than being homeschooled by their parents
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.760]   because their parents know them,
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.520]   their parents know what they're interested in,
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.960]   and they can learn and work at their own pace.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.720]   That's really, really useful.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.280]   In many ways, you could say one of the best environments
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.000]   is if you have a healthy, happy home,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.200]   it's the best environment for your child to be in.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.560]   Your child doesn't get bullied.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.080]   Your child doesn't get picked on.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.480]   Your child doesn't develop all these weird phobias
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:48.740]   and insecurities, and your child isn't influenced
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.960]   by peer pressure and all these just weird stuff
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.560]   that happens in the industrial school system.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.120]   And that stuff happens in private schools
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.360]   and in government schools.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.100]   So I think homeschooling does have a lot
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.000]   to go to offer it.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.960]   One of the things I really love about homeschooling
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.280]   is it can be very time efficient.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.840]   Because the child is only working on their own level,
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.360]   they can work diligently and then be done.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.200]   And three hours for a young child,
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.120]   four hours for an older child,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.600]   it seems hard for me to imagine the curriculum
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.480]   that would need more than four hours
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.680]   of focused work by a child.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.220]   And so what that does is it frees up the rest of the day
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.760]   for many of those other things.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.280]   The development of a hobby, the development of a skill,
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.000]   the development of a business, just whatever it is.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.560]   If it's wandering around the woods shooting rabbits,
[01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.520]   or if it's becoming a world-class swimmer,
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.480]   or if it's becoming a really great bookkeeper
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.360]   and studying accounting, or if it's learning
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.960]   to program apps, or learning to draw beautiful artwork,
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.460]   learning to play the piano.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.200]   When you can bring school down
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.440]   and have a really excellent academic instruction,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.560]   yet bring it down to about four hours,
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.800]   that leaves the rest of the day open to those other things,
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.280]   those other pursuits.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:06.160]   And in hindsight, if I look back at my own schooling,
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.680]   so for context, I was homeschooled through seventh grade
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.120]   with the exception of one year at a government school,
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.840]   then I went to a private Christian school
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.560]   from seventh grade through 12th grade,
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.640]   then I went to a private Christian university
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.360]   for my bachelor's degree,
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.520]   and then I got a master's degree in financial planning
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.100]   through distance learning
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.160]   at a secular financial planning college.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.160]   So when I look back, one of the resentments that I have
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.760]   is the massive waste of time
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.100]   that I perceive so many of those classes to have been.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.000]   My parents had other reasons for putting me into a school.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.240]   I think those reasons were good,
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.480]   and I am certainly open to putting my children
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.380]   into a private school in the future.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:50.960]   And I think there are times, I try to emphasize this,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.880]   but there are times at which parents need
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.360]   to put their children into a government school.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.880]   There is a time and a place for it, not the majority,
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.960]   but there are situations for where that is appropriate.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.120]   But in hindsight, it just seems like such a waste of time.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.160]   And I think about the skills that could have been developed,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.280]   the interests that could have been indulged,
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.120]   the businesses that could have been built.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.960]   If I weren't stuck in that time-wasting system,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.080]   sitting in class, hearing a teacher lecture
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.440]   about something that could have been learned from the book,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.560]   that's one of the resentments that I have.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.280]   It's not an emotional resentment.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.920]   I talk about it freely and openly.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.520]   Don't worry, my parents,
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.880]   I don't have anything against them for it.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   It's just one of those things
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.400]   when you look back and you consider.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   But on the other hand,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.960]   you look at people who homeschool exclusively,
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.560]   and there seemed to be a list of dangers
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.080]   and things that they could be exposed to,
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:43.120]   where resentments that they could have.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.520]   And so I don't know a solution other than to say,
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.680]   let's trust the parents to look at their child
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.480]   and discern what is in the best interest
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.120]   of their child at that time.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.880]   Some of the biggest challenges of homeschooling
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.880]   involve things like curriculum choice,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.320]   also just things like maintaining
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.640]   a positive, motivated environment.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.440]   It seems like many homeschooling parents
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.840]   can just slack off and allow their child to slack off,
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.680]   and I don't see how that's good for the child.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.200]   Sometimes you put a child into a competitive environment
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.640]   at a more traditional mainstream school,
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   and that can raise up a challenge for them.
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.040]   One of the challenges of homeschooling
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.920]   is you don't have as many things available to you.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.680]   So you look at homeschooling, for example,
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.760]   I did a lot of theater when I was in high school,
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.920]   really enjoyed it, acting in musicals
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.800]   and singing and things like that.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.760]   You look at something like that,
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.440]   you say, how do you have that for a homeschool child?
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.000]   You can't have a world-class theater production
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.840]   as a homeschooler, just can't happen.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.880]   So there are benefits there to schooling
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.360]   or access to things like lab equipment, et cetera.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   Now, as a parent,
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.040]   you can invest in those things for your children
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.840]   as you see it being important and worthwhile.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.840]   And so there are options there, but that can be hard.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.280]   So then you go to a private school and say,
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   well, are there private schools?
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.240]   I think there are many benefits to private schooling
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   that do exist, but a lot of the private schooling
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.640]   seems to be not original and new
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   and focused around the best interest of the child.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.400]   It seems to be one of a couple of things.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.760]   Most of the time in my observation,
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   many private schools simply take the industrial school model
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.120]   that was perfected in the government schools.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:33.480]   And then either in a secular private school,
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.260]   they simply say, well, we're gonna eject the bad kids
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.560]   and we're only gonna have rich kids
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.160]   and we'll have better teachers and better equipment, et cetera
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.400]   in the secular private schools
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.580]   or in the Christian private schools.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.600]   They often just kind of say, well,
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.880]   we'll take the whole system from the government school,
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.240]   but we'll just basically baptize all this stuff a little bit
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.560]   and we'll have a Bible class
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.320]   and we'll hire Christian teachers,
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.360]   but there's not really much meaningful difference.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.000]   There's not a different articulation
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.840]   of the worldview of education
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.620]   where Christianity is infused,
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.620]   where everything is taught from a Christian perspective,
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.200]   where you see that every subject
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.760]   comes into a biblical worldview,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.680]   where every subject, whether it's mathematics
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.520]   or chemistry or biology or physics or geography,
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.880]   how everything now comes into a Christian perspective.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.040]   Now, most Christians aren't even able
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.600]   to articulate those worldview issues,
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.640]   but that's what a Christian school should be doing,
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.640]   in my opinion, and it's hard to find those.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:28.000]   And so you look at it and you look at the cost of it all,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.280]   and sometimes you say, is that really worth it?
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.900]   One of the best things about homeschooling
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.840]   is it can provide for tremendous flexibility,
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.040]   and that's one thing I really love about it.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.640]   I love, love, love not having my family's schedule
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.360]   dependent on any outside person.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.660]   That is a wonderful luxury.
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.240]   We don't have a work schedule.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.040]   For me, we don't have a work schedule.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:53.160]   For my wife, neither of us have to apply for leave time
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.160]   or for time off or work out who's gonna cover our shift.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.400]   And for the children, we don't have to deal with any dates.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.660]   We don't have to deal with a date that they start work,
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.300]   that they don't start work or class.
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.380]   It's wonderful, and so that means that we can do
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.480]   what's in the best interest of our family.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.560]   At the moment, I'm inclined to do year-round schooling
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.560]   rather than to have a summer break.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.080]   That's something that people look at,
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.680]   but I don't see any point of taking
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.240]   an arbitrary artificial break just for some summer season
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.960]   if there's no use of the time.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.420]   What we are doing at present, and of course,
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:32.320]   with young children, is just simply taking breaks
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.160]   when it's right.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   So if we're traveling, we take breaks.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.400]   We don't do school if we're traveling.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.320]   If we're doing holidays or something like that,
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.880]   we take breaks, and then if we're at home
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.600]   on a normal schedule, we do school.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.240]   And I think that has a lot going for it.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.480]   Certainly, it can help the child.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.520]   If you run the math on having your child
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.040]   do schooling effectively, say, 10 months a year
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.480]   instead of seven, eight months a year,
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.080]   it's a big, big difference compounded
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.000]   over a number of years.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.040]   And so that's something that, another kind of little
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.400]   weird thing that we're into.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.220]   I think ultimately the future where the best results
[01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.560]   are gonna be to have for parents who are looking
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.040]   for something is gonna be some kind of hybrid model.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.080]   You see this with homeschooling,
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.780]   with the use of homeschooling co-ops and such.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.800]   It's a rare and unusual homeschooler
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.360]   that just does everything at home,
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.780]   who's not part of some kind of community group,
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.000]   some kind of children's group, some kind of co-op, et cetera.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.640]   Whether it's very informal, such as a play date once a week,
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.160]   whether it's programs, field trips,
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.160]   whether it's specific classes, and you come together
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.720]   two or three days a week and then do work at home
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.080]   the other couple days a week, there are various models
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.120]   that are being worked on and tested.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.320]   And I think that some of these hybrid models
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.180]   are probably going to be some of the strongest models
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.540]   in the future, because you do gain benefit.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.580]   People, the number one objection that people have
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.980]   to homeschooling is always,
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.620]   what about child socialization?
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.380]   It's the dumbest objection,
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.260]   but it's the most common objection whatsoever.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.020]   People say, well, what about child socialization?
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.540]   Who's your child gonna hang out with?
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.060]   As if a child who is homeschooled doesn't see people.
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.260]   And the first thing is that generally,
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.900]   I don't want my children being taught
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.180]   by most other people's children.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.240]   That's what happens.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.700]   You send most children into a school system
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.560]   and very quickly now they come back
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.600]   and you have to, a whole lot of stuff,
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.160]   standards that you hold as a parent
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.640]   that other people don't, it's just very, very difficult.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.320]   So especially at the young years, that's super important.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.760]   But then, but there is a consideration there
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:32.680]   that is certainly true, such as friendships
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.480]   and community activities, and can a child learn
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.440]   to relate to peers of their own age?
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:39.080]   Well, the other reason it's such a silly objection
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.200]   is it's pretend that somehow homeschoolers
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.800]   just don't leave their house.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.440]   And in general, homeschoolers, yeah,
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.000]   you have three or four hours a day,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.480]   but homeschoolers are far more available
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.880]   to go wakeboarding in the afternoon
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.960]   or to go camping this weekend, et cetera.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.640]   And so if there's a, are there other sources
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   of groups of children, such as a neighborhood
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.320]   or such as a church group, et cetera,
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.920]   then there are plenty of opportunities for children
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.520]   to build and maintain friendships.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.640]   And instead of being in an artificial environment
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.040]   where you're forced by the government
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.640]   to be in a class with somebody who's bullying you
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:10.120]   or somebody you don't like, which is a totally artificial
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.680]   and destructive environment,
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.240]   then a child has much more options of choice.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.000]   Hey, I joined the local club doing this,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.440]   but there's somebody that I don't like,
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.000]   and it's just, there's somebody that's mean to me.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.600]   Well, you leave the club and you go do something else.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.160]   You're not forced into forced associations
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.940]   and relationships like you are
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.540]   in the government school system.
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:30.320]   My opinion is one of the worst things
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.760]   about government schooling is, and you look at it,
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.800]   you see the bullying rates,
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.520]   you see the suicide rates among children,
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.880]   you see the psychological devastation
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.280]   that is wrought by the environment,
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.040]   and it just, it seems tough.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.400]   Now, it takes work by a parent.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.600]   For example, especially in the United States,
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.320]   most of the neighborhoods that once buzzed with children
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.760]   have been hollowed out.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.780]   Depending on where you live,
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:56.080]   there may or may not be children in your neighborhood.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.600]   If you're living in downtown San Francisco,
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.080]   there's no children.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.640]   If you're living in other neighborhoods,
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.000]   there might be some,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.200]   but they're just not nearly the number of playmates
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.400]   that children traditionally had on their block
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.840]   and across the street, et cetera,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.120]   as fewer people are having children
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.840]   and the families that are having children
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.280]   are having fewer children.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.480]   So it takes work.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.000]   Church groups, youth groups, things like that
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.680]   are certainly worthwhile,
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.140]   and then homeschool organizations
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.000]   and clubs and interest groups,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.800]   there are opportunities out there.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.560]   The other model that I think will really grow in the future
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.200]   is the hybrid model that's reversed,
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.700]   where it's school, it's a private school,
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.600]   but where the parents are still very involved.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.100]   And I think there's a lot of stuff that could grow there.
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.900]   Now, I'm gonna close this episode
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.320]   with a brief discussion on classical education.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.360]   Listener writes in and says,
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.280]   "Joshua, what are your thoughts
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.720]   "on the classical Christian education approach?
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.160]   "My wife and I have two boys, and like every parent,
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:54.560]   "we want to give them the best possible education possible.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.600]   "I have learned through some research that I have done
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.960]   "that the best education they can get
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.200]   "is through homeschooling.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.860]   "However, my wife and I both work,
[01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:02.480]   "and we can't accommodate homeschooling
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.980]   "at this stage of our lives.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.420]   "The closest approach that we have found
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.320]   "to a Christian and homeschool education
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.420]   "is the classical Christian model.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   "Just wondering what your thoughts are on it."
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:12.560]   So I thought this would be interesting,
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.620]   because it is one of the biggest growing
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.260]   and most popular trends,
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:18.580]   especially in the homeschooling world,
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.680]   and especially in the Christian religious
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.320]   homeschooling world.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.960]   For example, probably the most popular homeschool model
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.480]   would be an organization, a company,
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.620]   called Classical Conversations,
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.320]   that's kind of one of these hybrid approaches.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.680]   The child goes to meet with other children
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.820]   of their peer group once or twice a week,
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.860]   and then the rest of the work is done at home.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.660]   But there's a comprehensive model
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.620]   put through a comprehensive curriculum.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:44.920]   Most of that is at home.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.460]   There's also a large and growing, thankfully,
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.380]   movement of classical Christian schools.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.520]   So specifically, traditional private Christian schools,
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:56.960]   classrooms, bells, teachers, all desks, all that stuff,
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:57.820]   the traditional model,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.560]   but done in the classical model
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.080]   with distinct Christian distinctives.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.480]   I would guess that there are plenty
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.780]   of classical schools out there,
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:08.760]   some of the elite schools,
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.260]   especially in the Northeastern United States,
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:11.520]   the elite private schools,
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.320]   but not wishing to live in that part of the country,
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.980]   it's not been an interest of mine to research.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:19.380]   So what do I personally think
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:22.480]   about the classical Christian model?
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.060]   So the first thing is to understand
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.180]   what is meant by the word classical.
[01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.380]   And there could be a number of different things
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:29.560]   that are meant by that,
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.620]   depending on who you talk to.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.680]   Perhaps the most common understanding
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.660]   would come from those who have read Dorothy Sayers' essay
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.420]   called "The Lost Tools of Learning."
[01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.960]   If you have not read that essay,
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.360]   just scroll way, way back in your RSS feed for the podcast
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.160]   to October 28, 2014,
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   and you'll find an audio recording
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.460]   of me reading her essay, "The Lost Tools of Learning."
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.060]   And I think it's an excellent essay
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:58.720]   that everybody should listen to.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.320]   But Dorothy Sayers popularized for many modern people
[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.560]   the concept of the trivium,
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.120]   which is traditionally what people point to
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.220]   when they talk about a classical education.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.460]   In traditional medieval education,
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.160]   you had the trivium, which is logic,
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:18.820]   sorry, grammar, logic, and rhetoric taught,
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.620]   and that would be followed by the quadrivium,
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.420]   which traditionally was arithmetic, geometry,
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.680]   music, and astronomy.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.680]   And that was the traditional medieval approach to education.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.760]   Now, Dorothy Sayers took that concept
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.620]   and she expanded it into,
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:37.080]   and tried to relate the trivium
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.320]   into different phases of a child's life.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.220]   So she suggested that we think about the grammar stage
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.520]   as the initial years of a child's education,
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.020]   where they're learning and memorizing the concepts
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.580]   and information that is taught to them.
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.340]   Then the logic stage,
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:57.640]   where they're being taught specific logical reasoning
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.140]   and grappling with the concepts as they become older,
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.740]   the time where a child,
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.020]   I think her words were like the parrot stage,
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:05.920]   then the pert parrot,
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.440]   where the child starts to be argumentative,
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.540]   where you'd go ahead and teach the child
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:12.020]   to argue with logical training and logical education.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:13.540]   And then you go on to the rhetoric stage
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:16.040]   where the child is learning how to articulate,
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.820]   be it verbally or in written form,
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.020]   concepts, ideas, arguments, et cetera,
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.120]   to be persuasive towards other people.
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.420]   I think the trivium traditionally
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:28.680]   was seen as giving the tools of learning,
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:33.080]   that once a child had knowledge and mastery of the trivium,
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.980]   that they could then apply that methodology
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.680]   to almost any other subject.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.380]   And so in essence, that's really what any of us do.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.680]   If I wanna learn a new subject,
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:45.340]   I need to learn first the grammar of the subject.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.620]   The grammar could be defined
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.340]   as the basic words of the subject,
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.580]   the basic content of the subject.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.620]   Then I need to deal with the logic of the subject,
[01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:58.020]   the arguments, the controversies, et cetera.
[01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.380]   And then you learn how to do the rhetoric of the subject,
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.520]   where you learn how to articulate your own concepts
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.420]   built upon your study of those things.
[01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:07.140]   And so the trivium provides a basic model of learning
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.520]   that can be applied to almost any area.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.980]   So if by classical, we mean the trivium,
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.920]   then that would be one thing.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.080]   When you get to classical,
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.740]   that also can mean to some people,
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.720]   the use of the so-called great books.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.020]   If you were to go back to Mortimer Adler's work
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.340]   of putting together the work, all the great books,
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:28.980]   and publishing the great books,
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.340]   and reading the great books,
[01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.180]   all of the Roman and Greek thinkers,
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.420]   and all of the luminaries and philosophers
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.020]   who contributed to Western civilization,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.080]   that's often thought to be the concept
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.080]   of a classical education.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.920]   To some people, classical education
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.320]   involves the study of Latin,
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.440]   that you have to learn Latin,
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.380]   and there are various arguments and defenses made
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.440]   for why you learn Latin.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.580]   And I guess what else?
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.420]   I guess some people just say,
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:55.920]   well, what the traditional model,
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.740]   the model of education prior to government coerced schooling
[01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.740]   of 18, prior to 1850, what happened before 1850?
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.240]   So you have to define what you mean by classical.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.920]   Now, in general, I think if a school is going to embrace
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.820]   the labeling classical,
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.140]   they're probably demonstrating a much higher level
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.180]   of academic commitment than many other schools,
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:19.920]   than just someone saying, oh, we're a random private school.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.640]   So I think that's a good thing.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.580]   One of the more interesting things to wrestle with,
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:26.780]   'cause you're combining the terms classical and Christian,
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   as is it possible that something classical can be Christian?
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.340]   This is, in my opinion,
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.120]   a very interesting and worthwhile debate.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.020]   Now, in the classical model,
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.880]   I don't see anything particularly wrong about the trivium,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.820]   for example, but in the classical model,
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.480]   you're primarily thinking about Roman and Greek thought.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:47.740]   And so the question is, should Roman and Greek thought
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.740]   be primary influences for somebody who is a Christian?
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.020]   I don't personally think that question
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.220]   should be taken lightly.
[01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.820]   Now, in the modern American context,
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.440]   there is no question that the Roman and Greek thought
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.580]   has had an intense influence on American society.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.920]   Even if you dig into modern religious history,
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.620]   there's no question, in my opinion,
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:18.620]   that Roman and Greek thought has had an intense influence
[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.320]   on the Christian religion.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.580]   Just look at the way that St. Augustine
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.580]   is revered and studied,
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:28.780]   and the Augustinian flavor of Christianity
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.740]   is heavily influenced by Roman and Greek thought.
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.680]   There's a lot to be said for Roman and Greek thought,
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.020]   but it's my personal opinion
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.620]   that Roman and Greek thought developed
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:40.780]   in a time of a spiritual vacuum.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:45.580]   If you look at the history of humanity
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.140]   that we have as recorded in the Bible,
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.240]   the way that I think about the Bible is,
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:51.640]   it sounds trite, but as his story.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.040]   The Bible is a collection of history,
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:56.200]   the books that are historical in nature,
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.980]   as it's important to God.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:01.100]   It's certainly not a comprehensive collection of history.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:01.940]   There are many things that happened
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.640]   that were not included in the Bible,
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.040]   but we have a compilation of the historical account
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.880]   that was important to God.
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.400]   Well, there are two basic giant periods of time
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.440]   that are recorded in the Bible
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.140]   that are simply not, sorry,
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.200]   there are two giant gaps of time
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.800]   that are recorded in the Bible.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.100]   So the earliest things that we have,
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.840]   of course, we have some discussion of Adam, Eve, et cetera,
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.740]   and then figuring out the timeline of Adam and Eve
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:32.900]   related up to Abraham, et cetera,
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.400]   can be challenging depending on what perspective
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.900]   you come at and how you apply.
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.560]   Your, how you come to that.
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.700]   But by the time we get to Abraham,
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:43.560]   we get a fairly specific timeline.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:46.620]   So Abraham, of course, somewhere around 2000 years BC,
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.660]   something like 4,000 years ago, something like that.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.660]   We get to Abraham and then the patriarchs.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.300]   So you have Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.000]   and all of Genesis from, so Genesis one through 12,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.500]   the account of creation, Adam, all the way through Abraham.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.960]   And then from Genesis 12 through 50,
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.500]   you have the account of the patriarchs.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.920]   Again, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.720]   Then we have a 400 year gap
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.760]   from the time of Genesis to Exodus,
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.020]   where we have no information of what was happening.
[01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.960]   As best we can understand, during that 400 years,
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.160]   God was silent and inactive.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.400]   And this was the time that the children of Israel
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.960]   were enslaved in Egypt.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:25.120]   And so here you see, in this time period,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.700]   you see the great, the development,
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.400]   the Genesis of the great civilizations in Egypt,
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:31.660]   India, and China.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.060]   That's where those civilizations
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.460]   start to have their development,
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.620]   in that 400 year period when the slaves,
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.600]   when the Egyptian, sorry,
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.720]   when the Israelites are enslaved in Egypt.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.920]   Then in somewhere around 1500 BC,
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.920]   then you have the Exodus,
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.920]   you have Moses, the prophets, et cetera,
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.460]   and you have the basic beginning of the children of Israel
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.260]   with the high point of about a thousand years BC,
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.060]   where you have King David, et cetera.
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.600]   And then you start to have the decline
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:59.660]   of the Israelite emperor with the major prophets,
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.360]   the minor prophets, and then the exile of Israel.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.960]   And then you have a period of 400 years before Christ,
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.220]   where we have no information of what happened.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.060]   We have no information of what God was doing.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:15.500]   As best we can determine, God was entirely silent
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.960]   and totally inactive in the world,
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.820]   as Nietzsche would say, God is dead, right?
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.520]   Totally silent, inactive, and not active at all in the world
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.900]   during that 400 year gap.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.120]   And that's the point in time,
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.560]   during that 400 year period of 400 BC,
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.220]   that's the point in time that we have Socrates,
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.460]   Plato, Aristotle, that's when we have the development
[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.760]   of Roman and Greek thought.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.400]   That's also when you have Buddha, Confucius,
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.620]   Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar,
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.600]   all of these names of history,
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.300]   but they're not involved in Christian history.
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:45.760]   They are certainly very involved in history,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.800]   but they're not involved in Christian history.
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.700]   So now, where do you see Christians
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.360]   interacting with that culture?
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.100]   Well, you go to the book of Acts,
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.200]   most especially Paul, and you see Paul.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:58.420]   What did Paul do when he was in Athens?
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:02.200]   Here he is in Athens debating the Athenian philosophers.
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.160]   Here he is confronting them, and what you don't see
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.160]   is you certainly do not see Paul sitting down and saying,
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.800]   well, let me sit down and listen
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:13.800]   and try to learn from your knowledge of the gods.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.000]   You see Paul instructing them and saying,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   back to the story of the unknown God,
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.660]   the monument to the unknown God,
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:21.200]   let me tell you about the true and unknown God.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.800]   It's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.260]   And so it's very hard to, if you present the claim,
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:30.260]   it's very hard to say that the number one focus
[01:27:30.260 --> 01:27:32.100]   for a Christian should be studying
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:34.000]   the Roman and Greek philosophers.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.040]   Now, as a philosophy student, you can't help
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.000]   but study the philosophers because they have certainly
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.100]   shaped modern philosophy, but I would not point to them
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.500]   as Christian in any way, and certainly,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.920]   if you look at what the Roman Empire did to Christians,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.600]   you look at how, and you say no more.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:55.360]   There's a reason why the Roman Empire
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:59.300]   persecuted and killed thousands and thousands
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.900]   and thousands of Christians.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.660]   So now I get a little nervous when all of a sudden now,
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:06.800]   we start to ascribe the same thing to,
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.020]   in an educational model, and you say, okay,
[01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.300]   well, let's go ahead and have the classical education
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.560]   and let's start studying the Romans and Greeks
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.020]   as our primary examples.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.300]   To me, that seems dangerous, right?
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:20.100]   As a Christian, you serve the God of Abraham,
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:25.100]   Isaac, and Jacob, not the God of Socrates,
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.400]   Plato, and Aristotle.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:28.440]   They're very different.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.000]   The gods of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.100]   are not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:36.300]   So I get concerned with that, but I think that in general,
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.360]   the classical Christian model is not generally
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.000]   on that level, and so what people are trying to say
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.360]   is we're trying to understand the history
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.700]   of Western civilization, which certainly should involve
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.040]   reading Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle,
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.400]   and then the many Christian philosophers
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.060]   and secular philosophers, et cetera,
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.100]   who've been involved in the great conversation
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.000]   throughout the last several thousand years of history
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.340]   that led to Western civilization as we know it.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.240]   So is it a bad thing?
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:05.160]   No, I don't think so.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.000]   Perhaps the most robust defense that I would refer you to
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.500]   if you're interested in the actual background of this,
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:13.700]   way back in the '90s, Doug Wilson,
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:16.000]   who was a pastor in Idaho, wrote a book
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.040]   called "Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning,"
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.940]   an approach to distinctively Christian education.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.060]   Douglas Wilson, "Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning,"
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.940]   an approach to distinctively Christian education.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:28.200]   And of course, the allusion there
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.800]   is to Dorothy Sayers' essay,
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.960]   and he talks about his experience
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.460]   starting a classical Christian school
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.340]   there in Moscow, Idaho.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:37.760]   He and his wife had young children,
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.300]   and they didn't think that they wanted to homeschool,
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.200]   but there wasn't a good Christian school available,
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.760]   so they started one.
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.960]   And ironically, he did the same thing
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:46.800]   when it came to college.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.440]   His children came to college age,
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.200]   and he couldn't look around and find a good college,
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.040]   so he started one there.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.460]   He's a good starter of stuff like that.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.300]   But I would encourage you,
[01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.660]   if you're considering the classical Christian model,
[01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.960]   especially in a school,
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:00.740]   go and read that "Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning."
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.240]   'Cause Wilson, Wilson is certainly not shy about,
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.500]   he's certainly a serious biblical,
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:07.560]   like he takes the Bible serious,
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.300]   he takes biblical worldview, et cetera.
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.560]   He's not trying to preach,
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:16.100]   he's not trying to preach Aristotle and Plato and Socrates,
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.800]   but yet he does do a good job of talking about
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.600]   the classical Christian model in that.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.360]   It's probably the best defense that I have read
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.800]   on the classical Christian model.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.300]   In addition, I would say then,
[01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.940]   if you have it, you're likely to get much better results
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.240]   with a school that styles itself
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:33.800]   as a classical Christian school,
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.760]   just because they understand some of these things,
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.900]   the trivium, et cetera,
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:40.340]   and it's gonna be a significant hardcore environment
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.900]   of good academic instruction.
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:44.340]   I think that's a good model to be in.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:49.560]   And before, just to acknowledge,
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.960]   I think that in our context as modern Americans,
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.560]   even if we are,
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:58.200]   even if we identify as Christians,
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.260]   and even if we would, as I would,
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.000]   I would seek to encourage a more Jewish identity
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.440]   than a Roman and Greek identity,
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.000]   without question, the Romans and Greeks
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.200]   have exercised massive influence over our societies.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.700]   And so if we are not conversant in the philosophies
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.340]   that the Romans and Greeks developed
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.340]   and taught, and if we are not conversant
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.200]   in the massive impact of those philosophies
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.340]   on our world today,
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:33.060]   I don't think we are treating our,
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.600]   perhaps people who disagree with us, our debate partners,
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.900]   I don't believe we're treating them appropriately.
[01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.920]   We should know and understand the philosophies
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.700]   that led to modern Western civilization.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.160]   And then it's our job to continue to trim out
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.360]   the ungodly, unbiblical philosophies,
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:53.420]   and to substitute for those biblical and godly philosophies
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.240]   based upon the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.680]   But because the Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.020]   have been so influential in our world,
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.520]   we need to understand the impact of their philosophies.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.040]   And of course, everyone else through since.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.720]   I don't think we're dealing with things properly
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:11.120]   if we just ignore and say,
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.680]   you know, we don't study David Hume.
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.240]   We say, oh, I'm not gonna study David Hume
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.040]   'cause I don't think he was a Christian.
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:21.200]   You better understand what David Hume's contributions were
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.280]   to modern philosophy,
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:27.040]   even if your goal is to disentangle those philosophies
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.800]   and point out the error in them.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.160]   You can't choose the world that we're in.
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:33.000]   So for that context, I think there's a good argument
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.040]   in favor of classical Christian education.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.040]   Finally, then I guess you get to the kind of
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.760]   the question of Latin.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.120]   It's an interesting question.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:43.240]   I've wrestled a lot with it, the value of studying Latin,
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.760]   and I've read the arguments on it.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.640]   In general, my bias is in favor of,
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.560]   let's do it all the way.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.720]   If people say Latin is important, let's study Latin.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.920]   But I really get conflicted.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.480]   Is that really a good use of the child's time?
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.380]   There are a number of arguments in favor of studying Latin,
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.800]   but I just think, it seems like, to me at the moment,
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:08.680]   it seems like too much time for not enough reward.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.020]   The arguments on this subject just to me often seem thin.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.260]   And it seems like the time could be put to better use.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.580]   I mean, on the one hand, it seems like many of the reasons
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.300]   people give for studying Latin, for example.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:26.820]   They say Latin helps you understand English vocabulary.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.380]   And I think it does.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.700]   English is a Germanic language, but the vast majority
[01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:35.620]   of the words that we use come from Latin.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:38.460]   And so you have this weird amalgamation of a language
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:41.140]   where you have Germanic roots, so it doesn't follow
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.460]   the traditional structure that the more Latin languages
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.920]   like Spanish or French or Italian would follow.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.820]   But much of our vocabulary does come from Latin.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.420]   So they say, well, it enhances your vocabulary.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.180]   I think that's true, but I never had to try
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.420]   to learn a language to enhance my English vocabulary.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:58.100]   I learned my English vocabulary simply by reading books
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:00.340]   that expanded my vocabulary.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.780]   And then if you get used to studying new words,
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:04.540]   you start to learn when you see a word,
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.540]   hey, that looks Latin to me, and you can go and look up
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.900]   the Latin word if you're interested in it,
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.860]   or just read about the etymology of the word
[01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:11.220]   in your dictionary.
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.040]   You don't need to learn the language for it.
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.380]   Another argument that people give in favor of Latin
[01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:18.540]   is that it helps to order the mind,
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:22.740]   that by learning Latin, which is a concrete,
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:25.740]   structured language, it orders the mind,
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:27.060]   and it teaches you a discipline.
[01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:29.680]   I think that's true, but I think the same exact argument
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.820]   could apply to mathematics, and wouldn't the time
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:34.740]   be just as well used studying mathematics
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:35.900]   as studying Latin?
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:37.620]   Or another argument that you often hear presented
[01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.460]   is something like, well, Latin makes it easier
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.340]   for you to learn other languages,
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:44.340]   especially languages such as the Romance languages,
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:47.820]   Spanish, French, Italian, Castilian,
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:50.700]   what are some of the, Romanian, I think,
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.820]   is a Romance language.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:53.980]   Anyway, there's about five different Romance languages.
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.740]   And I think that's also probably true.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:56.940]   It probably is true.
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.460]   But in the same time that you spend learning Latin,
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.740]   which you're not gonna speak with anybody,
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.540]   then shouldn't you just spend the same time
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:04.900]   learning Spanish?
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.600]   For example, you do certainly, one of the arguments is,
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.600]   by learning Latin, you enhance your understanding
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.020]   of English grammar.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:12.880]   I think that's true.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.540]   And in Latin, they call it the declensions,
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.440]   learning your declensions.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:19.660]   But I learned, my English grammar improved
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.500]   when I studied Spanish, and I studied
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.780]   and understood the Spanish conjugations.
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:25.620]   I didn't ever think about or understand
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.660]   the subjunctive sense in English
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.700]   until I studied Spanish, where the subjunctive sense
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.820]   is very important.
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.380]   So I, again, say, why not take that same time,
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.220]   and can't we get more from studying Spanish?
[01:35:36.220 --> 01:35:39.780]   So it just seems to me still, even though I am inclined
[01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.780]   to wanna say, yeah, I gotta study Latin,
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.940]   I'm inclined to say, spend the time studying
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.100]   Spanish and French instead.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.980]   And then you'll have actually useful skills
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:53.100]   in addition to what I would guess would be
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.540]   at least most of the benefits of learning Latin.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.820]   The idea of going back and reading the classics
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.980]   in Latin to me just seems silly.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:02.060]   Why read it?
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:03.460]   Why read it in Latin when there's lots
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.780]   of good English translations?
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.860]   So I'm unsold on that.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:10.500]   I'd like to be sold, but I'm unpersuaded.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:12.780]   I would just say this, if I were in,
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:14.660]   if my children were going to a classical Christian school
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.020]   where they were learning Latin, I'd encourage it,
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.420]   and I would, I'd learn it with them.
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.280]   But in terms of in a homeschool environment,
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.140]   my taking Latin and trying to say, well,
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:24.100]   this is the key in a homeschool environment,
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:27.460]   it hasn't clicked with me yet, right now.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:30.780]   So in summary, my answer to your specific question
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.180]   would be this, if I could not homeschool,
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:36.180]   I would very much be looking for something
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.700]   like a classical Christian school.
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:40.720]   And my hope would be, and I've seen this,
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.360]   I've looked at websites and read essays
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.140]   by people who are involved in classical Christian schools,
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:49.460]   because there tends to be a greater level of rigor,
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:51.440]   I think you probably are gonna get
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.260]   a much more Christian education
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.280]   in a classical Christian school
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.460]   than you are in a mainstream Christian school
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:59.420]   that just says, oh, we're a Christian school.
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:02.500]   Because in general, when you bring the academic
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.920]   and intellectual rigor of faculty
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.580]   that are going to teach in a classically Christian school,
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.220]   and when they're gonna build on the trivium,
[01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:11.300]   which is super helpful and super important,
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.380]   and they're gonna bring the conversation
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.460]   from the great books to life,
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:16.860]   then I think you're going to be dealing
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:20.320]   with professors and administrators who value education,
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.200]   and who have grappled with the contradictions
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.960]   between a biblical worldview and a classical worldview,
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.420]   and who have answers for those things.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:34.100]   And so, although I don't see how classical and Christian
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.520]   can go together, like they're at direct odds,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.380]   again, the people who designed the classical education
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:41.620]   and the people who were studied in it
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.980]   are the ones who murdered thousands and thousands
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:47.060]   of Christians in the most horrendous of ways.
[01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.100]   That should be fairly obvious to anybody.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:52.820]   So I don't see how they can even go together
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.120]   without really considering it,
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.820]   but yet I would trust that the people who are doing that
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.660]   would have a rebuttal for that,
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.780]   and talk about how the ideas had developed,
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:05.940]   and would have grappled with the integration
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:10.940]   of what is biblical from the traditional great conversation
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.260]   and what is non-biblical,
[01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:17.580]   and that because our civilization is a civilization
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.700]   that was shaped by the classics, by these philosophers,
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:23.820]   by these philosophies, because these things
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.520]   were what led to the modern American civilization,
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.300]   I think that by having your child understand that
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.100]   and be part of that conversation,
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:39.220]   will suit them for life in a way that most won't.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:42.840]   I mean, at the end of the day, if you go to Washington, DC,
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.900]   the buildings don't look like a Jewish synagogue
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.180]   or the Jewish temple.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:49.620]   The buildings look like a Greek temple,
[01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:52.660]   or the buildings have Roman architectural influences.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.020]   And so, understanding and being conversant in that language
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:59.160]   I think is important for modern Christians.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.020]   And so, I think that if there's a good local
[01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:04.920]   classical Christian school, I think that's a good choice.
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.600]   I think a lot of parents would also be happy
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.980]   with some of the homeschool variations.
[01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:10.320]   Again, Classical Conversations being the most famous
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.520]   brand name in this space, it's just growing left and right.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.400]   And I think one of the things that I see
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.100]   about an organization like Classical Conversations,
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.440]   what they do is they bring together
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.180]   some of the really good things of the school model
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:27.680]   with the good things of the homeschool model.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:30.780]   So, Classical Conversations, it's not inexpensive,
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:32.320]   it's time consuming, et cetera.
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.580]   So, this is not for those who need
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.420]   just the cheapest bare bones homeschool curriculum,
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:39.560]   they can, and it is very much focused on the classics.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:42.680]   But what they do is they have a comprehensive curriculum
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.760]   that goes from the kindergarten years
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.520]   through the high school senior years.
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.520]   The comprehensive curriculum is academically rigorous.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.600]   They have all the materials available for you.
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.320]   One of the things I like, they do this timeline song
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.440]   in the beginning, they have the children
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.700]   memorize vast quantities of information
[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:03.800]   during that grammar stage.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.640]   And then they basically revolve around into it.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.760]   So, they flow through the trivium in their model.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.080]   And then by combining some of the good things
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:12.300]   of homeschooling, where most of the academic work
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.400]   is done at home, with some of the good things
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.200]   about teacher instruction, where you have a facilitator
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:18.840]   and a teacher, especially one who's not the parent,
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.880]   which I think could be really helpful for a child.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.280]   Many parents and children struggle with authority
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.760]   and how the teacher's authority conveys
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.000]   to the parental authority.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.920]   I've watched one of my children doesn't respond well
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:35.080]   to authority that's not my wife and me.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:36.980]   And so I've tried to correct that by bringing in
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:40.560]   other teachers to try to bring in and put him into his,
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.600]   I just gave it away, put him into a situation.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.520]   You try so hard to protect the anonymity of your children
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.920]   and yet you fail.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.000]   Put him into a situation where he's forced to confront
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.880]   authority figures that are not our own,
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.440]   so that we can help him to learn
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.480]   to respond better to authority.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.360]   And so the classical conversations model does that,
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.960]   where they come together once a week.
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.200]   There's a collaborative environment, friends, et cetera,
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.080]   social activities, et cetera.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.340]   And I see a lot of people really enjoying it
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:08.260]   and really doing well with it.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.360]   So that's one model for those who are in the in-between.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.920]   And I think that's probably a more successful model
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:15.440]   where people just say, I like this philosophy
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.920]   and I'm gonna go in with this hybrid approach
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.560]   than the standard homeschooler
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:22.000]   who's trying to put everything together themselves.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.240]   Many parents, especially many mothers,
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.120]   don't seem to have the confidence or the clarity
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.720]   on putting together a good homeschool curriculum.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:31.600]   And they should, but they often don't.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.000]   And so I think that's a good solution.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.920]   I guess the last thing I should have mentioned earlier
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.580]   that I find inspiring, one curriculum
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.920]   that I think is pretty neat,
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.100]   would be the Ron Paul curriculum.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.280]   That was developed by Dr. Gary North,
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.640]   who's been on the show, Christian economist
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.080]   and prolific writer.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.960]   And he coordinated the different professors.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.040]   He teaches some of the courses.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.160]   He teaches the literature course
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.120]   and the history course, I think,
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.000]   but then many other professors,
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.600]   including at least one listener of the show
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.880]   who teaches in the Ron Paul curriculum,
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.960]   who's written to me privately.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.280]   And I really like the Ron Paul curriculum
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:08.040]   because it seems to bring together and integrate
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.340]   some of these disparate ideas.
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:12.560]   For example, the literature courses
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.880]   or the history courses are extensive.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.320]   And by all accounts,
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.440]   all of the instruction is academically rigorous.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.760]   The children are required to write many essays,
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.200]   and that's really, really good.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.040]   It does take advantage of modern technology
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.280]   for teacher-student interaction.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:32.180]   For example, the students post their essays
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.480]   on their WordPress site.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.080]   So that gives them familiarity
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.680]   with things like blogging technology,
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.140]   which I think is particularly useful.
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:42.400]   And I like the fact that it's rigorous,
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.800]   but not what I perceive to be overly rigorous.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.600]   And I like the fact that it's not done with textbooks
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:50.800]   and pretty little things.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.520]   It's all done with reading the original papers.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:55.360]   I think one of the major weaknesses of the modern student
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.740]   is that the modern student does not know how
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:00.760]   and is not trained to go and consult the primary sources.
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:03.800]   And so we tend to just simply regurgitate whatever pundit,
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.380]   meaning the person who wrote the textbook,
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:08.320]   says rather than actually consulting the primary sources
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.620]   and then developing our own understanding from that.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.200]   So I really like the Ron Paul curriculum.
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.360]   My things I don't like about it
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.120]   is I don't like that it's all video-based
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.020]   'cause I don't like video.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.360]   I don't think it's healthy for children
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.960]   to stare at screens all the time.
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:24.840]   That's it.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.360]   And I don't, so it's both an advantage
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:29.020]   because video-based allows somebody to do it
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:29.860]   from anywhere in the world
[01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:31.480]   where they have a video connection.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.800]   It's a huge advantage, but at the moment,
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.920]   I don't see that as being something that I want to do
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.520]   to have video instruction.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.740]   But that does seem to be the direction
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:41.700]   of many good homeschool curriculums,
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:44.380]   many good curricula, many good materials,
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.700]   is to use the video base.
[01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.860]   And so I would guess that at some point,
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.580]   I'll have to fold on that and say,
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:51.580]   well, there's so much value to the video screen.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:53.660]   There's so much value to the internet connection
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:56.220]   that we'll just have to fold on the challenges
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:57.860]   of staring at a screen all day.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:58.700]   Those are my thoughts.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.020]   I thank you for listening.
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.420]   I hope they were useful.
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.300]   I know that many of you had written to me
[01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.260]   and said that because of some of the ideas
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:07.060]   and things that I have shared
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.460]   that you've pulled your children
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:10.380]   out of a government school.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.580]   And I want to thank you for that.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:13.020]   I think that's a great decision.
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:14.640]   Now I would just say, trust yourself.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.140]   As a parent, maintain a close relationship with your child.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:19.340]   Watch them to see what's actually happening,
[01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:20.780]   and then adjust accordingly.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:22.420]   If you see that something's not working,
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.700]   don't be scared to adjust.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:26.500]   Don't be committed to one certain philosophy.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:29.080]   Watch your child and do what's in the best interest
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:30.940]   of your child.
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:32.060]   - Big Boyz coming to Kings,
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.060]   is coming to Yamava Resort and Casino

[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.860]   - What is it about old Mexican men?
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.900]   They could be missing a leg,
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.380]   they still want to get into a fight.
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:50.740]   - Hosted by my man, Eric Blake
