[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   There's also an element where people aren't educated, so they all chase after the same
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800]   homes.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.000]   They want the ones with the best listing photos, the best locations.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   They're moving ready.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.820]   That gives you that emotional tingle that you just love.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.260]   Those are the houses everyone looks for.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.560]   You're just looking for something that other people are going to pass up that you see the
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.900]   value in, that you're going to put a little bit of elbow grease into.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.860]   Sometimes bad smells can really benefit you when you're trying to buy a home because it's
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.200]   going to turn off a lot of your competition.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200]   Ugly floor plans.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.600]   People don't realize it's usually not as expensive as you think to move walls around.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.020]   But when it's got a closed-off kitchen, you can't see what's going on in the family room.
[00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.980]   The wife's thinking, "I can't see what the kids are doing.
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.020]   I just don't like it."
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.020]   That's as far as they go.
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.080]   They don't realize that you can spend $2,000 and move a wall.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   You can see everything that's going on there.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400]   Then painting and flooring.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.680]   You can fix homes up for a lot less than what people think today.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800]   But you have to see the opportunity, not the move-in ready product.
