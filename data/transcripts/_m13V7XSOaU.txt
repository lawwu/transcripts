[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.520]   John Piper. Pastor John, here's the next question on the docket.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.680]   "Hello Pastor John, my name is Micah and I was wondering about Romans 2:15 and
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.640]   Hebrews 10, 16. Both speak about laws getting written on our hearts. The first
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.040]   speaks of a universal reality, or so it seems. The second is a spirit-brought
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.520]   supernatural reality of the new covenant. So what are these two laws? Are they
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   different? Are they the same? Do they complement one another? And what do they
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.040]   result in? Help me, I'm confused." One of the great things about this question is
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.120]   that it gives me an opportunity to, with both of those texts, Romans 2 and
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.600]   Hebrews 10, to say something amazing about the nature of mankind in general
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.640]   that I think would be really helpful for us all to know, and something
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.120]   wonderful about redeemed mankind in particular. And both of those insights
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.360]   are, I think, tremendously important for living in the world. So I'm glad
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.480]   the question was asked. So first let me admit, first of all, that there are
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   scholars who understand the law written on the heart in Romans 2.15 and the law
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.880]   written on the heart in these new covenant passages like Hebrews 10.14, as
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.360]   referring to the same experience of transformation by the Holy Spirit in the
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   heart of the Christian. That view is more common today. Very few took that view
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   historically. It's not my view. So let me read those texts and say what my
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.520]   view is and try to explain what the implications are and hopefully be of
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.000]   some help to Micah. Let's start with Romans 2.14. "For when the Gentiles who do
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.920]   not have the law by nature," and I emphasize that phrase because it ties
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   this passage in to Romans 1 where Paul was dealing with not with redeemed
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.440]   people and what they do by virtue of the Holy Spirit in their heart, but
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.680]   things that they do by virtue of being created in a human nature or a male and
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   female nature. So let's start over. "For when Gentiles who do not have the law by
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.000]   nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves even though they do
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.240]   not have the law," meaning the law of Moses. "They show that the work of the law
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.560]   is written on their hearts while their conscience also bears witness and their
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them." So the picture here, I think,
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.480]   is not of a born-again redeemed people who are enabled to walk in a way
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.720]   pleasing to the Lord by the Holy Spirit, but of the Gentile world in general who
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.960]   have enough knowledge of the moral law of God in their hearts by virtue of being
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.480]   created in God's image so that their consciences are conflicted, sometimes
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.160]   approving, sometimes disapproving. The other passage is Hebrews 10, 16, and 17.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   He's quoting the New Covenant promise in Jeremiah 31. "This is the covenant that I
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   will make with them after those days," declares the Lord. "I will put my laws in
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.480]   their hearts and write them on their minds." Then he adds, "I will remember
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.800]   their sins and their lawless deeds no more." Now the point here is that Christ
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.240]   has purchased the New Covenant promise and it includes the forgiveness of our
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.680]   sins and the replacement of an old unbelieving rebellious heart with a new
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.960]   heart of faith and obedience. So I think these two passages, Romans 2, Hebrews 10,
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.760]   and the other New Covenant passages like 2 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 8, are
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.520]   teaching two very different things and addressing two very different situations.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.280]   Hebrews is teaching that when we're born again, God gives us a new heart and a new
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.000]   spirit and the result is that the law of God written in Scripture is no longer
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.200]   offensive to us. We're no longer hostile to it like Paul says in Romans 8, 7.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.360]   We're not hostile to the Word of God but rather we're submissive. We delight to do
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.160]   God's commandments. It doesn't mean that we know them all by heart because they're
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.120]   written on our hearts. It doesn't mean that. It means that when we read them in
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   the Word, the inclination to do them is in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. This is
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   a great work of the Holy Spirit purchased by the blood of Christ called
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.920]   the New Covenant. That's what I think is going on in Hebrews 10 and it's an
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:33.840]   awesome privilege for Christians. In Romans 2, what Paul's doing is very
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.000]   different. The train of thought, let's get the train of thought from verse 11
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.280]   down to where we're jumping into verse 15. Let's get that in front of us. First
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.880]   he says, and this is the main thesis of the paragraph, "There is no
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.960]   partiality with God." And then he defends that in verse 12 by saying that
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.680]   God's judgment will fall according to how we respond to the measure of truth
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.320]   that we have access to. That's why he's not partial. Then he explains this in
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:17.160]   verse 13 that hearing the law of God is no advantage to the Jew. In other words,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.480]   merely having it and hearing it is no advantage to the Jew at the judgment day.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.400]   And not hearing it is no advantage, disadvantage, to the Gentile because
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:37.160]   doing, not hearing, is the issue. And then he explains, verses 14 and 15, that the
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:44.600]   law really is available to those who have no copy of the Mosaic law because
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:54.000]   God has put it in the hearts and given all of us a conscience to awaken us to
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.040]   this moral knowledge in our hearts. And what he means is not that every Gentile
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.480]   unbeliever in the world knows all 600 commands in the first five books of the
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:14.120]   Bible. What he means is that all human beings have sufficient knowledge of what
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.800]   is right and wrong written on their hearts so that their consciences can
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.400]   accuse them or affirm them. And at the judgment day they will not be held
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.200]   accountable for what they have no knowledge of, no access to. But they have
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:39.440]   access to many things about right and wrong. I think we're on the right
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:49.080]   track here in 215 because if you look back into chapter 1, he's been teaching
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:58.360]   this very thing already. He says, chapter 1, verse 32, "They know the ordinance of
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.160]   God that those who practice such things are worthy of death." That's exactly
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.800]   what he just said in 215. They know the ordinance of God. And in 126 he says,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.880]   "Women exchange their natural function for that which is against nature." They
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.680]   know it's against nature. And that's the phrase he uses in 214 and 215. And
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:29.840]   chapter 1, verse 21, "They knew God." And the point of it all is to stress that
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.200]   every human being is guilty before God because every one of us, all human beings,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.000]   suppress, chapter 1, verse 18, "Suppress the truth and none of us live up to the
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.080]   demands of our own conscience, let alone the demands that God has given and that
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.880]   we know in our hearts." So here are the two great lessons for us that made me
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.840]   glad this question was asked in the first place. Real obedience, even though
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.040]   imperfect, real obedience to God, even though imperfect, is made possible
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.720]   through the work of Christ for all who believe in him. God does the decisive
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.400]   work of taking out the heart of rebellion, putting in the heart that
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.520]   loves the commandments of God, and that's the glorious truth of having the law
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.240]   written on our hearts according to the New Covenant in Hebrews 10. Second great
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:38.400]   truth, every human being in the world, every child in your family, every person
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.560]   that you work with, everybody in your neighborhood, has an inborn knowledge of
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:52.400]   God according to Romans 121 and an inborn knowledge of the moral law of God,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.800]   132, 215 of Romans. This means, among other things, I mean the implications are
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.760]   many, that when we're speaking to people about the Christian faith and about why
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.800]   we live the way we live and what God expects of this culture and this society,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.520]   we're not starting from scratch with those people. There are profound things
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:23.200]   already in their hearts that God may make use of to help them see what we're
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.600]   saying. That's very profoundly encouraging for the evangelistic task
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.520]   ahead of us. Thank you, Pastor John, and for more details about this podcast or to
