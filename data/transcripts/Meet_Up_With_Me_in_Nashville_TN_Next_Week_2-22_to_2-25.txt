[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.120]   Hey Radicals, this is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.720]   If you are in the Nashville, Tennessee area, I will be up your way this coming week.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.080]   I will arrive on Monday, February 22 and I will be there in Nashville on Tuesday, February
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.860]   23, Wednesday, February 24, and Thursday, February 25, 2016.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.520]   If you are in the Nashville area on any of those days, please reach out to me on Twitter
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.040]   at JoshuaSheets if you would like to meet up while I am there in the area.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   I love when I go traveling or when I'm at a conference.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.640]   I really, really enjoy meeting up and talking with listeners, sometimes just for a few minutes,
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.880]   sometimes for a long time.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.440]   But please reach out to me on Twitter at JoshuaSheets, again, J-O-S-H-U-A-S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.900]   Link to my Twitter profile in the little blog post and show notes for this show.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.600]   At the moment, I'm not intending to host a group meetup, so you'll have to reach out
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.160]   to me and we will coordinate something specifically.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.560]   Watch my Twitter feed for information on that.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.480]   I will be at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center at 2800 Opryland Drive,
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.080]   Nashville, Tennessee, 37214.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.840]   If you're at the hotel or if you're in the area and you see me, please don't hesitate
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   to say hello.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.920]   I'm kind of hard to miss these days.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.520]   I'm about 6'6" and I have a massive red beard, so it's a little bit hard to miss me at this
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.560]   point in time.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.200]   If you're not in Nashville, but you'd like to keep track, if you're just interested in
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.560]   seeing pictures of what's going on, connect with me on all the social media stuff, Instagram.com/JoshuaSheets,
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   Facebook.com/JoshuaSheets or Twitter.com/JoshuaSheets.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.280]   I probably don't say that stuff as much as I should, but I do really enjoy connecting
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   with listeners there.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.720]   It helps me to get a sense of who you guys are when I look at your pictures and I'm able
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.560]   to connect on those social profiles.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.240]   Feel free to friend me on Facebook or to look me up on Instagram or Twitter and please,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   connect with me there.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.560]   I'm a regular listener of the show and then I can get a little insight into your lives.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.720]   Social media is awesome because podcasting otherwise is sometimes a one-way lonely communication.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.660]   So I really enjoy connecting with you guys on those channels and I hope to meet many
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.800]   of you in Nashville next week.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.300]   Don't just dream about paradise.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.520]   Live it with Fiji Airways.

[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.340]   (upbeat music)
