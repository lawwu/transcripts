[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, wisdom is so vital to our lives. As we saw on Monday, looking at stimulants like
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   caffeine, sugar, nicotine, amphetamines, and cannabis, and THC, for some, it's a complex
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   world, and it's getting more complex by the day, and it's a world that we have to navigate
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   with wisdom. We have to. And for guidance, Psalm 19.7 is one of my favorite texts.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Psalm 19.7, the psalmist tells us, "The teaching of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple." Making wise the simple.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   That's the frequent prayer of this simple man, "I need wisdom," which is to say, "I need the
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   teachings and the testimonies of the Lord." And so Monday, we apply biblical wisdom when
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   it comes to stimulants. And on this pursuit of wisdom recently arrived this clip from
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   a listener who sent it in. It's from a 1981 sermon from Pastor John in Proverbs 4, verses
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   1-13, talking about where to find wisdom. I had not listened to this message, but I
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   did recently. I love it, because Pastor John opens by talking about our pursuit of joy,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   which is what drives all of our lives and the substances that we consume. Pastor John
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   said this, "I believe that all men have this in common, namely, that we all want to be
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   happy." Now, not all of us agree on how to find that happiness or where it comes from,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   but we do agree that we want it. I think that's common ground for all humankind. And that's
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   not a bad thing. That's a good thing. That's the way God made us. Evil is not wanting to
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   be happy. Evil is seeking and finding that happiness in the wrong places. And goodness
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   is seeking and finding that happiness in places that please and honor God. I can conceive
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   of a world in which we might be called upon to sacrifice our happiness for God's glory.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   But that is not the kind of world in which we live. Amen. Evil is not wanting to be happy.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Evil is seeking and finding that happiness in the wrong places. Such a great intro to
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   this search for wisdom. Okay, so how do we find wisdom? Here's Pastor John later in that
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   very same message. And now finally, I want to give you five brief instructions as to
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   how to get this wisdom. These have been really helpful for me to think about again. And I
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   think they all come from Scripture. I'll try to show that they do. Step number one, we
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   must desire it, hunger for it, long for it. Proverbs 4, 8, "Prize her highly and she will
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   exalt you. She will honor you for your embrace." Those are not cheap words. When you prize
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   something and you embrace something, you love it intensely. And therefore, wisdom has to
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   be valuable to us. We have to want it and crave it. Otherwise, we will not get it. Second,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   since wisdom is found in the word of God, we have to apply ourselves to meditate upon
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   the word and study the word of God. And I want to add to that this, not only applying
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   yourselves to the scriptures firsthand, but also giving yourself to read the finest wisdom
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   of the best students of the word for the past 1900 years. Read great theological books,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   books that distill the wisdom of God down and help us gain a sense of the sweep of God's
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   revelation and insight into the true meaning of Scripture. It would be folly for us all
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   to start from scratch when there's so much help to be had in great books. And now I want
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   to give you something really encouraging, because I know what goes through many of your
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   minds when I say that. I don't have the time nor the ability to get anywhere with that
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   kind of literature. If you're talking about great books of theology, I don't believe that's
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   true. Great books are always great because they're readable, not because they're obscure.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Obscure books are not great books. Now, here's the most encouraging thing I can think to
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   say to you this morning. My pastor told me four years ago it changed my life. Here it
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   is. Suppose that you can read about 250 words a minute. Now, that's not real fast. Most
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   of us can do that. Two hundred fifty words a minute. OK, and suppose that you set aside
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   15 minutes a day to read a great book, a classic or some book that you've been longing to read
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   that would help you grow in your wisdom, your understanding. Now, 15 minutes a day for 365
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   days is five thousand four hundred and seventy five minutes a year. Now you multiply five
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   thousand four hundred and seventy five times 250 and you get one million three hundred
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and sixty eight thousand seven hundred and fifty words that you could read in a year
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   at 15 minutes a day. Now, an average book has about three hundred and fifty to four
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   hundred words on a page. So we take three or three hundred to four. So we'll take three
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   hundred and fifty, which is kind of in the middle and divide that into one million three
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   hundred and sixty eight thousand seven hundred and fifty. And you know what you get? Three
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   thousand nine hundred and ten, almost four thousand pages a year. An average book has
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   about 200 pages. You see the implication of that? You could read 20 books by this time
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   next year, setting aside 15 minutes a day. I tell you, when I heard that, I ran home.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I sat down. I got out my calendar. I looked for that 15 minutes slot and I found it just
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   before supper at five fifteen because I diddle away that that time every night and I set
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   myself to do it. And I read Jonathan Edwards original sin, which is a fat book in two months
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   at 15 minutes a day. And then I went on to see us, Lewis and George McDonald, lots of
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   other things I've been wanting to read and read. God's all that reading that I said,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   there's no hope. I don't have time for it. I don't have any space to fit it in. Was now
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   getting done because there was a 15 minute slot that I was using that had formerly been
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   thrown away. There is hope. You people who think that there's no hope there is. You have
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   15 minutes. You have 15 minutes. Say the 15 minutes just before you go to bed at night.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Go to bed. Pick out a great classic like John Calvin's Institutes or Martin Luther's bondage
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   of the will or commentary on Galatians or John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress or Jonathan
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Edwards, religious affections or some great book you just been itching to read and say,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   oh, there's no way and read it at 15 minutes a day. A big tree can be chopped down with
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   lots of little chops. That's a great incentive, I think, to get wisdom. And then third, we'll
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   just briefly cover these last three. We must pray because wisdom comes from the Lord. And
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   then for we must think of our death very often. Teach us to number our days that we might
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   get a heart of wisdom. Nothing purges us of folly like thinking of our death. And then
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   finally, we must come to Jesus. In him are found all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Solomon spoke wisdom. Jesus is the wisdom of God. Others had spoken truths. Jesus is
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   the truth. Others had made promises in him. All the promises of God are yes. Others had
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   offered forgiveness. Jesus bought it. Therefore, in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   and knowledge. A person who loves and trusts and follows Jesus has and owns the treasure
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   of lasting and true happiness. And therefore, when the command comes to us, get wisdom,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   it means first and foremost, come to Jesus. Come to Jesus in whom are hid all the treasures
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   of wisdom and knowledge. And now may the wise God fill you with his godly wisdom that you
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   might enjoy now and forever the true and lasting happiness that is found in him. Amen.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Amen. True and lasting happiness is found in Christ. This clip came from a podcast listener
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   named Kyle in Geneva, Illinois. I came across this amazing message from Pastor John a few
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   years ago while I was really trying to figure out what it means to be wise. Kyle writes,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "There are so many good scripture passages and insights in it, but the part that really
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   made an impact on me was the section where Pastor John goes over how many pages of reading
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   a person can consume in a year by reading for 15 minutes a day." Kyle says he now sets
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   out to read 20 books a year. Thank you for the clip. Taken from John Piper's sermon
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   titled "Get Wisdom." Preached on May 24th, 1981. The whole message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, to shift gears here, when it comes to the return of Christ, there are a lot of truths
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   to be celebrated and anticipated. There's also a lot of misconceptions we must cut away
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   from the topic, too. And Friday, Pastor John is back to walk us through five popular blunders
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   about the return of Christ. That should be a lively one. I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   We're rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday. We'll see you then.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   [END]
