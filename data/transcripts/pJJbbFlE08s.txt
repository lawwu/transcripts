[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   One way to get extra points without having to spend money
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.300]   is to transfer your points during a transfer bonus.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.960]   I don't like the idea of locking your points
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.520]   into one airline when they otherwise could have been flexible
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.160]   because airlines are devaluing their miles all the time.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.280]   However, in some cases, I find that it's worth it.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.320]   When Bilt had a 100% transfer bonus to Aeroplan,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.080]   I transferred a ton of my Bilt points over to Aeroplan
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.240]   because I could turn 100,000 Bilt points
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.920]   into 200,000 Aeroplan.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400]   And so that to me was absolutely worth it.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   I felt reasonably confident given that Aeroplan,
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.320]   I think has more airline partners
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.000]   than any airline in the world,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.080]   that I would be able to get good value.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.580]   And even if those awards went up 50% in cost,
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.880]   I'd still come out ahead.
