[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   We have 40 questions in the inbox about Acts 2 38.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.360]   There in the text a bunch of seekers have gathered and Peter says to them, "Repent and
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.920]   be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.640]   sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.040]   Indeed, 3,000 people repent and are baptized.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.840]   It's an amazing sight.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.840]   The text also appears to put water baptism prior to conversion or in the moment of conversion.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.680]   Likewise, Paul was told to "rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name"
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.160]   in Acts 22 16.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   Dozens of listeners have written in over the years to basically ask, "Are we saved, Pastor
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.560]   John, after water baptism, before water baptism, or in water baptism?"
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   What would you say?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:00.040]   I would first answer by making the question more precise because the way I'd pose the
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.240]   question is, are we justified before, in, or after?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.440]   Are we united to Christ?
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.800]   Do we become one with Christ and God becomes 100% for us before, in, or after baptism?
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.320]   Because in the New Testament, the word "saved" is used for what happens before, in, and after
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.320]   baptism.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.080]   Ephesians 2 8, "We have been saved."
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.240]   First Corinthians 1 18, "We are being saved."
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.640]   Romans 13 11, "Salvation is nearer to us now than when we believed."
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   So being saved happened before, happened now, is happening now, will happen finally in the
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   future.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.360]   So the word "salvation" in the New Testament is broad and includes pieces of salvation,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.120]   and what's really being asked is, when did it all start?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.000]   The first moment of union with Christ, the moment of justification, which is not a process
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.200]   like sanctification is, but decisive.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.640]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.600]   When did that start?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.920]   At what point does God count us a child, not a child of wrath, which we all are by nature,
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:40.160]   Ephesians 2 3, but a child of God, so that from that point on, He is 100% for us with
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.960]   no wrath?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.080]   When did that happen?
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:53.720]   What was the decisive means that brought it about, that united us to Christ, that justified
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   us?
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.000]   So that's my question.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I think that's really what they're asking.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   And it's the same, I mean, they're right to be concerned about it.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.240]   There are texts that are puzzling.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:17.720]   So let me give my answer from texts and then show how that point relates to baptism.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.600]   So Romans 3 28, "We hold that one is justified by faith, apart from works of the law."
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.240]   Romans 5 1, "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God."
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:44.040]   Romans 4 5, "To the one who does not work but believes in Him, who justifies the ungodly,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.960]   his faith is counted as righteousness."
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.240]   John 3 16, "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.960]   Him should not perish but has eternal life."
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:10.040]   Acts 13 38, "Through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.280]   who believes is freed or justified from everything from which you could not be justified by the
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.520]   law of Moses," and on and on and on I could go.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.000]   I had a bunch of others, and I thought, for time's sake, I'll just leave them out.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.800]   So here's my inference from those texts and many others like them.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.360]   Justification, being put right with God by union with Christ in the divine miracle of
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.600]   conversion and new birth, that point is by faith and faith alone on our part.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:55.800]   God uses faith as the sole instrument of union with Christ and thus counts us righteous and
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.720]   becomes 100% for us in the instant that we have faith in Jesus.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:11.120]   That's my answer, and now the question is, okay, how do you talk about baptism and how
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   do you understand those texts that were quoted that seem to connect baptism to that act,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.600]   that beginning?
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.960]   So let me give some answers to that.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.600]   First thing I would say is that the thief on the cross was told by Jesus that that very
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.860]   day he would be with Him in paradise.
[00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.440]   He was not baptized, and therefore, though I know he's a special case, I don't think
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:45.160]   you build a theology of baptism on the thief on the cross, but one thing it says is baptism
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.480]   is not an absolute necessity, because it wasn't in his case.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.240]   Here's the second thing I would say.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.560]   Paul treats baptism as an expression of faith so that the decisive act that unites us to
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   Christ is the faith, and it is expressed outwardly in baptism.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   Here's a very key text for me, because when I went to Germany, I was a lone Baptist in
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.440]   a den of Lutheran lions, and they were loving lions.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.440]   They just licked me.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.720]   They didn't eat me, but they did not approve of what I believed.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.240]   I remember taking a retreat with 12 little cubs and one big doctor father named Leonard
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   Gulpult, and we were talking about baptism the whole weekend, and this was my text.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.960]   This was my text that I put up.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:49.480]   I said, "In," this is Colossians 2, 11 and 12, "In Him," in Christ, "also you were circumcised
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.680]   with a circumcision made without hands by putting off the body of flesh by the circumcision
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   of Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.100]   Him through faith."
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:20.020]   You were buried with Him and raised with Him in baptism through faith in the powerful working
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.300]   of God who raised Him from the dead.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:30.560]   So the burial with Christ in the water and the rising with Christ out of the water, it
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.740]   seems to me from that text, are not what unites you to Christ.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.800]   That is the going under the water, the coming up out of the water, that's not what unites
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   you to Christ.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.000]   It is through faith that you are decisively united to Christ.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.420]   And here's an interesting analogy, since circumcision was brought into the picture there, and there's
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.920]   kind of an image of circumcision in Colossians 2.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:07.560]   If you go to Romans 4, 11, Paul says, "Abraham received the sign of circumcision as a seal
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:15.320]   of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was uncircumcised.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:22.960]   The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.320]   so that righteousness would be counted to them all."
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.740]   So if you just take the analogy, and that's all it is, it's just an analogy between baptism
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:41.760]   and circumcision, then this text would say that baptism is a sign of a righteousness
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:50.280]   that we have before we are baptized, because we have it through faith and through union
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   with Christ.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:59.880]   Then we go to the relevant text in Acts that the questioner raised, like Acts 22, 16.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.440]   "Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins."
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.720]   Now if you stopped right there, you'd say, "Well, there it is, you know?
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.320]   The water is the forgiving agent."
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.600]   But that's not where you stop.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.700]   It says, "Rise, being baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name."
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.220]   So the sense, I think, is the same.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.960]   Baptism is the outward expression of calling on the name of the Lord in faith.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.760]   It's not the water that effects our justification or union with Christ.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:47.440]   The water is a picture of the cleansing, but the faith in the heart, the call on the Lord
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.600]   from faith is what unites us and forgives us.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:01.420]   Now that's the meaning that 1 Peter 3:21 actually picks up on when it says, in relationship
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:09.360]   to the flood and Noah's rescue through the ark, through the water, it says, "Baptism,
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.000]   which corresponds to this," that is the salvation of Noah's family in the ark and the flood,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.040]   "Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you."
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:26.280]   That's probably the most clear text for those who want to say that baptism is salvific,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.720]   actually does the saving.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:32.740]   It says, "Baptism saves you," and then immediately, as though he knows he said something almost
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:39.900]   heretical because it would so compromise justification by faith, he says, "Not as a removal of dirt
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.640]   from the body, but as an appeal."
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.340]   So now we're back to this call issue.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:52.760]   Wash away your sins by calling on his name, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.580]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:00.540]   In other words, the call of faith from the heart, not the water.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.500]   And he explicitly says, "Not the removal of dirt from the body."
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.140]   In other words, it's not the actual functioning of the water that does the saving, even though
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.180]   I just said baptism saves you.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:20.740]   What I mean is that this outward act signifies an appeal to God that's coming from the heart,
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.620]   and it's that faith that saves.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:32.740]   So when John the Baptist calls his baptism, or Mark calls his baptism, a baptism of repentance
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:41.220]   for the forgiveness of sins, it probably means a baptism signifying repentance which brings
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.400]   forgiveness, because repentance is simply the way of describing the change of mind that
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.820]   gives rise to faith.
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.820]   Now here's one last important text that they're raising.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.460]   In fact, this is where you begin, Acts 2:38.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:05.380]   Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.900]   of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.940]   So it looks like repent, condition number one, be baptized, condition number two, and
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.620]   forgiveness will be given to you.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:24.180]   And I've been arguing, because I think so many texts teach it, that no, repentance and
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:30.820]   faith as one piece are what obtains forgiveness, not the baptism.
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.500]   So what, you disagree with this text, Piper?
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.420]   Who do you think you are?
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.620]   And I think that text should be read something like this.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.700]   And I remember seeing this years ago and then finding it other places.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:54.380]   Suppose I say to you, Tony, you want to go from Phoenix to LA on the train and it's about
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.620]   to leave, and I say, "Grab your hat and run or you'll miss the train."
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.580]   Now I just gave you two commands, like Peter gave two commands, repent and be baptized.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:15.660]   But only one of them is a cause of getting to the train on time, namely running.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.660]   Run!
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.060]   That said, grab your hat.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:27.420]   Grabbing your hat is an accompanying act, not a causative one.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.140]   It may be very important.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.100]   Now there may be all kinds of reasons why you should have a hat.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.100]   Like why did you tell him to grab a hat?
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.660]   Well, I've got my reasons, you know, for all kinds of reasons.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:44.320]   But grabbing the hat does not help you in the least get on the train on time.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:51.980]   Now that's the way I think we should hear Peter when he says, "Repent and be baptized,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.300]   every one of you, and make the train of forgiveness."
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.940]   You get on the train of forgiveness if you repent and are baptized.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.980]   And the repentance, the change of mind that includes faith, gets you to the train.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:13.540]   And baptism is important for all kinds of reasons, but it's not causative in the same
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.540]   way that repentance is.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.460]   So here's my bottom line answer to the question.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.020]   Faith precedes baptism.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.460]   That's why I'm a Baptist.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.800]   Faith precedes baptism and is operative in baptism.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:38.820]   So we are justified at the very first act of genuine, saving faith in Christ, and then
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:46.860]   baptism follows, and preferably would follow soon, as an outward expression of that inward
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.860]   reality.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860]   That's good.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.780]   Yeah, you don't want to forget your hat in Phoenix.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.780]   You'll sunburn your head.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.780]   Good.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.340]   Well, I'm glad there's a good reason for it.
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.340]   Indeed.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.140]   And we recorded this episode in the studio in advance of Pastor John leaving for his
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.580]   second stint in Europe in 2019.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.980]   He is currently ministering in Holland, France, and Germany until early October.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.820]   A huge international year for him.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.700]   Remember, he was in South America earlier in the year and in Europe once before already
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   this year.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.060]   Would you pray for his safety and for Noel and for the fruitfulness of their ministry?
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.060]   I would appreciate it.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.180]   Again, they're in Holland, France, and Germany this time around.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:33.120]   Well, how does John Piper want you to use this podcast in your life?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.040]   By God's grace, we have a large listenership now.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.460]   There's a lot of you who listen in every time.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.820]   But each of us also have friends and spouses and pastors and parents in our lives who we
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.060]   should also be seeking out for advice.
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.620]   So how does this podcast, Ask Pastor John, fit within the constellation of voices that
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.940]   God has put in your life?
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.580]   It's a really important question.
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.100]   We've never addressed it head on, and we need to.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.500]   It's up next on Wednesday.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.480]   We'll see you then.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
