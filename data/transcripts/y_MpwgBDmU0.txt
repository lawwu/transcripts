[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   the book of the prophet Ezekiel in the 36th chapter and the 25th verse. The 25th verse
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:27.960]   in the 36th chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel. Then will I sprinkle clean water
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   upon you and ye shall be clean. From all your filthiness and from all your idols will I
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.480]   cleanse you. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean. From all your
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:01:01.160]   filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. We are considering these Sunday
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.200]   evenings this great message which is to be found here in this 36th chapter of the book
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.800]   of the prophet Ezekiel starting at verse 16 and going on to the end of the chapter. And
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.120]   we are doing so because here we have a very perfect statement of the gospel of our Lord
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.600]   and Savior Jesus Christ. Now I wonder whether anybody is surprised at a statement like that
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.180]   and is tempted to say how can you say that you've got a statement of the gospel of
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.200]   Jesus Christ in the Old Testament. The answer is of course that the Old Testament is full
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.360]   of the gospel. It foretells it, it foreshadows it. It is indeed the great prophetic message
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   in the Old Testament as it is in many senses the only message in the Old Testament. But
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.280]   in certain places it is put particularly clearly and this happens to be one of them. It is
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.200]   put as you remember in the form of a message addressed by God through the prophet Ezekiel
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.600]   to the children of Israel in the captivity of Babylon. Ezekiel is one of the prophets
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.160]   of the captivity. He was with them, he sat down side by side with them by the waters
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.400]   of Babylon and there they were far from their own country. And the prophet delivers this
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   message to them. And we have seen that this message has got various steps and stages.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.560]   The first thing that God tells these people is that they must realize why they are where
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.640]   they are and that it's because of their sin which is hateful to him and abhorrent
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:05.440]   in his sight and which he has punished by allowing their enemies to attack them and
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.360]   to conquer them and to carry them away captive. He brings that home to them. But then having
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   done that he goes on to say that in spite of them for his own name's sake he is going
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.440]   to deliver them. And he goes on to tell them how he's going to do so. We were considering
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.960]   it in general last Sunday night in the 24th verse where he says "for I will take you
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.800]   from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.920]   own land." And there we saw a general description of this wonderful gospel of salvation.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.760]   Now I've been repeating this point because it's so important. God's message to men
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   is always the same. There is only one great message and this is the message. You see ever
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.440]   since men fell into sin the world has been the same. Surely there is no need to establish
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.920]   that point. And yet one feels at times that there is because we all tend to take such
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.960]   a superficial view. And because we ride in motor cars and in aeroplanes and other people
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.880]   say five thousand years ago used to walk or ride on beasts and animals we think we are
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.840]   vastly different from them. But the fact is we are exactly the same. We are guilty of
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.640]   the same sins. We have the same needs and troubles and problems. There was jealousy
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.760]   as far back, you remember, as the very beginning of history between two brothers called Cain
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.960]   and Abel. And Cain murdered his brother. And the world is still doing that sort of thing.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.520]   And men and women are still full of the same things, jealousy and envy and malice and bitterness
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.040]   and spite and hatred. They still covet. They still are governed by their lusts and passions.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.220]   Men is still and always the same. So the word of God to him is still and always the same.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.520]   And what the world needs this evening is this old message that was addressed by the prophet
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.400]   Ezekiel to the children of Israel. Now I put it like this last Sunday night, that we, all
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   of us, the human race in its entirety, is like the children of Israel away from home.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.080]   It's somewhere where it shouldn't be. And what is needed above everything else is deliverance.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.360]   For whether we like it or not, sin is a bondage, it's a captivity, it's a serfdom. And all
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   of us born into this world are born the slaves of sin. And we can't liberate ourselves.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.880]   We are held in the captivity by the devil and his powers. And we are absolutely helpless.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.320]   And we can't get back to where we were meant to be. But God has provided the way. That
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.240]   is the message of salvation. And he says, I will bring you back to your own land, and
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.160]   that means that we come back to the place where God again looks upon us and blesses
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:34.360]   us. Where God once more showers upon us his gifts, and we are in that right relationship
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   for which we were originally created. Now then, that is the statement as far as we have
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.600]   gone. But now we continue, and here we begin to come to the details.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   We get here what we get so frequently in the Scriptures. First of all, the complete statement
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:59.520]   is made. Then it's taken up again, and we are given its component parts. And in this
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.600]   verse, this twenty-fifth verse, that we're looking at together tonight, we come to the
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:13.800]   first detail. What is the first thing that is essential to the salvation of men? What
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.680]   is the first thing that is absolutely vital to all of us before we can know God and his
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:28.800]   wondrous blessings? Well, here it is. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:39.120]   be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. Now, this
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   I say is the first. It isn't the last thing, but it is the first thing. There are other
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:53.280]   things to follow. And you notice how wonderful they are. A new heart also will I give you,
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.360]   and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And listen to this on which Sunday evening,
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my steadiness, and ye shall
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.640]   keep my judgments and do them. There's a prophecy, you see, of what happened at Jerusalem
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:26.000]   on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was shed and poured forth upon the church.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.960]   You've got it in the second chapter of Joel. You've got it here. It's in many other places.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.680]   I will send showers upon the thirsty land, says Isaiah. It's always the same. Well,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.280]   now, here you see, in other words, we rarely have got a complete and full statement of
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.640]   the Christian gospel, the Christian message. But the thing I want to emphasize tonight
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:09:01.960]   is this. The first question, the first problem we must of necessity face, is our sin, is
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.280]   the guilt of our sin. Now I'm going to bring you back from that land of Babylon to your
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.560]   own land of Canaan, said God through Ezekiel to these people. Yes, but he makes it very
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.040]   plain and clear that before they can be brought back, they've got to be cleansed. They've
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   got to be washed. They are filthy. From all your filthiness and from all your idols, will
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   I cleanse you? Well, there it is, and it's still the same. The Bible always starts with
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.920]   this. But of course, it's something we none of us like. We all are conscious of the need
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:54.200]   of help. We are conscious of many needs. Life has got us down, and we're in trouble and
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:02.640]   in perplexity. It's a very simple thing to prove that. All the tensions and the stresses
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:10.320]   of the modern world are bearing eloquent testimony to that. The way people are ready to clutch
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.080]   at anything and are living on drugs of various sorts and of kinds is just proof of what I'm
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.000]   saying. There are problems, there are difficulties, and everyone is conscious of the need of help,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.600]   the need of assistance, the need of guidance. What am I to do? Where am I to go? We are
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.560]   conscious of our own smallness and inability, and we feel we need all this. And if we are
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.320]   told, well, God is ready to give you guidance, he's ready to help you, and so on, we're
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.160]   interested in it and we're ready to listen to it. But here again I say we've got to
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:58.000]   remember this, that there is an absolute essential preliminary, and that we shall experience
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.400]   no blessings whatsoever from God until we have first faced this problem, the guilt,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:15.640]   the pollution, the filthiness of our sin. And therefore anything that offers itself
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.400]   as the gospel, which offers to give you help or assistance or guidance or anything else,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.440]   which doesn't first of all hold you face to face with your guilt, and the need to be
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:36.760]   washed, is not the Christian message. Now I'm putting it very dogmatically, because
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.280]   I know there are theories and teachings held before people today who tell them that they
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.560]   can come to God and be blessed by God, and who never mention the need of this washing
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:55.200]   and this cleansing. And I say that is not the Christian gospel, that is not the Christian
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:06.080]   message. This is always in the first position. In other words, let me put it like this, that
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:16.160]   a right relationship to God is impossible until the question of our sinfulness has been
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.400]   dealt with and has been solved. Now this is something I say which is emphasized
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:29.400]   everywhere in the Scriptures. And surely if we have any right understanding of the being
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.200]   and the nature and the character of God, we shan't be surprised at this. The Scriptures
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:43.960]   tell us that God is light, and that in him is no darkness at all. That God is a consuming
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:52.000]   fire, that God is holy, he dwelleth in a light which is unapproachable. How is it possible
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.560]   for men covered by the guilt and the vileness and the filthiness of sin to have communion
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:06.600]   and fellowship with such a being? Surely on the very surface it's quite impossible.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:13.240]   God's character, I say, alone in his righteousness and his holiness makes it a sure and an utter
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:20.040]   impossibility. But God has made it very plain in an explicit manner.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.200]   Now you've got it in your Old Testament. The Apostle Paul sums it up by putting it
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:33.080]   in these words, he says, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:40.720]   and all unrighteousness of men." It's been revealed. God himself has revealed it.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.160]   When God gave his Ten Commandments, what was he doing? Well he was just giving a revelation
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.120]   of this. Here were these children of Israel whom he'd formed for himself. He tells them
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.520]   that having delivered them out of the bondage of Egypt, he's going to lead them into the
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.320]   land of Canaan, and they're going to be his people and he's going to bless them.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:07.440]   Yet, he says, you must remember the condition. You must live and behave as my people. I am
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.760]   a holy God, therefore you must be a holy people. Be ye holy for I am holy, saith the Lord.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.200]   So he gives them the Ten Commandments. And there he not only tells them how they ought
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.560]   to live, he warns them of the punishment that will be meted out upon their sin.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.920]   Now the wrath of God is a fact. He has manifested it. He's revealed it. And of course nowhere
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.860]   has he revealed it more clearly than in the case of the children of Israel themselves.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.800]   This very paragraph with which we are dealing brings it out very clearly. It was God himself
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.080]   who allowed these people to be conquered and to be carried away to Babylon. He had told
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:56.160]   them that he was going to do that. And you remember that in these words we read it like
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:01.640]   this. I scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:09.520]   according to their way and according to their doings. I judged them.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:18.480]   Now God is there revealed, I say, his attitude towards sin. That he hates it, he judges it,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:27.840]   and he must punish it. Therefore I say it is an obvious deduction that the first question
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:34.880]   that must of necessity arise before we can be back into communion and fellowship with
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:44.400]   God is this question of our sinfulness. And so you see as you read your Old Testament
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:51.200]   this is what you find. You find men approaching God and they take a sacrifice with them. You
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.080]   remember Abel took a sacrifice. Even at the very beginning it was clear that no man could
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:02.840]   approach God without some sort of offering or a sacrifice. You come along and you read
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.720]   the books of Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and you get all this about burnt offerings
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:13.840]   and sacrifices, animals being slain, the blood being sprinkled, the high priest going into
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:20.400]   the presence of God presenting blood. What's it all mean? Well it just means this. Sin
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:28.760]   has got to be dealt with. There is no relationship between men and God while men is covered in
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:37.880]   his sin. God receiveth not sinners. He cannot receive them as they are because he is God.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   Now the whole teaching of the Bible emphasizes that. And therefore we must recognize it as
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:52.440]   something which is absolutely cardinal and vital to our whole position. So that you see
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.700]   my friends the first thing that you and I have to do if we want to know God and to be
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:07.040]   blessed of God, the first thing we have to do is to realize that somehow or another this
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:14.720]   question of our sinfulness, our guilt in God's presence must be dealt with.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.600]   Now you see we've got a perfect illustration of all this, haven't we, in the New Testament
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   in the parable of the prodigal son spoken by our Lord himself. That man came to himself
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.680]   and when he went back to his father he didn't just go back and say, "Father I've come
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.800]   back. Bring out the fatted calf. Give me my robe. Produce the ring. I see now that I can
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.760]   do with these things and I want to have them." Not at all. He came back and he said this,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:50.640]   "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thy face and am no more worthy to be
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:59.480]   called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." He's a man who realizes his
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:06.640]   guilt. He feels that his conduct and his behavior has cut him off from his father. He's forfeited
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.120]   every right as a son. He doesn't appeal to his father as father in a sense. He says,
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:20.080]   "I'm only worthy to be a son. Take me in as one of your servants." Now that's
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.120]   the very essence of the right approach and that's why our Lord so put it. And again
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.760]   you've got it. You've seen the parable of the publican and the pharisee who went
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.120]   up into the temple to pray. The pharisee walks right to the front and he says, "I thank
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:40.240]   thee, O God, that I am not as other men are." He felt a need of God. He wanted to be right
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:45.280]   with God but there's no problem of sin for him. He just boasts of what he's done and
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.200]   then I suppose he wants God to grant him certain blessings because he's so good. But there's
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.160]   the other man beating his breast and unable even to look up and says, "God, be merciful
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   to me, a sinner." His guilt, his sinfulness, his vileness, his filthiness, he feels he
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.360]   hasn't the right, he hasn't the claim. "I say unto you," says our Lord, "that
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.680]   that's the man who went down to his house blessed and justified." Why? Well, because
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   the man has realized the problem of sin. He realizes his filthiness, his vileness.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:34.520]   Oh, my friends, we can never emphasize this too much. You read the lives of all the men
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.400]   and women who've lived in this world and who've known God and who've been blessed
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:48.080]   by him and who have testified to his power and to his love and compassion. These people
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.240]   who though they were often surrounded by problems and difficulties and trials were unable to
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.000]   rise above them all and the memory of whose lives is a veritable benediction for us all
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.280]   and you can never read about them or think of them without feeling, "Well, that's
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:11.920]   life as it ought to be lived." You'll never find such a person. But that they always
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:20.360]   and invariably acknowledge and confess their sin, their own unworthiness, their own unrighteousness,
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:27.760]   the filthiness of their lives as they were by nature and unaided. It's the first thing.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:37.280]   We must be cleansed and God puts it first here, "I will cleanse you, I will wash you."
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:46.280]   But that of course leads us to the next point which is this. How can this be done? What
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:56.640]   can we do about our sins? We've all sinned. We've all sinned deliberately against God.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.880]   We've ignored him, we've forgotten him. We've deliberately flouted his laws. We've
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:10.680]   disobeyed our conscience. We have deliberately sinned against God and there is the record.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:19.800]   The sin is upon us. This filthiness as it's called here, this guiltiness, this stain of
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:32.640]   sin, this vileness of sin. What can we do about this? How can you remove it? How can
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:39.200]   you erase it? How can you make the page in the book of your life white again? How can
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:47.440]   you get rid of the blots? Have you ever tried to do it? Have you ever tried to wash yourself
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.240]   spiritually and to make yourself fit to stand in the presence of God?
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:22:03.560]   Oh, I needn't keep you. Let me give you a quotation out of the 51st Psalm which really
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:14.520]   says it all. David writes the 51st Psalm. He was guilty of terrible sin. He was guilty
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:20.400]   not only of adultery but of murder on top of it. And he's awakened to it. He suddenly
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.960]   comes to see it. And he wants to get right with God and wants to get back. And this is
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.360]   how he puts it. "Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness. According
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.680]   to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:44.240]   from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin." He can't do it. Burnt offerings, he
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.800]   says, and sacrifices are not enough. He tried to cleanse his heart, to cleanse himself,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:59.760]   but he knows he can't do it. And his only cause, he tells us, is to go back to God himself.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   Ah, this is the testimony of all who've ever known God's blessing. "Not the labors of
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:17.760]   my hands can fulfill thy Lord's demands. Could my tears forever flow? Could my zeal
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:32.600]   now respite now? All for sin could not atone. Thou must save, and thou alone." You see,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.360]   here it is. This is the initial problem. Before I begin to think of my future, and any man
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.560]   who once is awakened to his position in life and face to face with God, he becomes alarmed
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.600]   and concerned. He wants to be right in the future. But before you come to the future,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:55.480]   think about this past. Pilate said, "What I have written, I have written." And we can
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.760]   say, "What I have done, I have done." And the stain of sin is upon us, and all this
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:07.320]   unworthiness and filthiness and vileness. And we cannot touch it. We cannot remove it.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.000]   And yet we can have no relationship with God while it's there. God cannot even look upon
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.280]   sin. Now this, you see, is the very essence of the Christian message. It's all here
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.680]   in this verse we're looking at. The answer to the problem is this. "Then will I sprinkle
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:33.040]   clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:43.120]   idols? Will I cleanse you?" This is, if you like, the paradox of the gospel. It is
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.200]   all there, of course, in that 51st Psalm. Has it ever occurred to you to look at it
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.040]   like this? Here is a man like David who says against thee, "The only have I sinned and
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:02.600]   done this evil in thy sight." And yet he knows that the only one who can deliver him
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:10.200]   and put him right is the very God whom he has offended. And that is the heart of the
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:19.800]   gospel. Men can do nothing. You can't erase these spots. You can't get rid of this thing
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:26.240]   which you've done. Sin is upon us, and we can't get rid of it. Well, what can we do?
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:32.560]   Well, the astounding thing is that as we're in our predicament and see and feel our hopelessness,
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:42.240]   it is God himself who speaks to us. And he announces to us that he himself is going to
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.760]   wash us. The very God against whom we've sinned and whom we've offended is himself
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:56.640]   going to cleanse us and to purify us and to render us capable and fit of standing in his
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:09.960]   holy presence. And that leads us to the next step. How does he do it? How does he do it?
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:16.440]   I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. Now that's, of course,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.360]   the Old Testament method. That was the way in which they did it. They used to take a
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.520]   heifer and burn the heifer, and then they took the ashes of the heifer and put it in
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.600]   water and mixed it, and people who had sinned or who touched a dead body and had done various
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.120]   other things were sprinkled with this water, and thereby they were cleansed. That's the
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.040]   pictorial language that's used, but it's all a foreshadowing of something. And of what?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:49.440]   The glorious message of the New Testament. How does God wash us from the guilt of our
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:27:00.520]   sin? Why, this is the very heart and nerve of the New Testament gospel of salvation.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.720]   It's the thing that we are reminded of by the bread and the wine. It is the great function
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.220]   of the Holy Spirit who was sent into the church on the day of Pentecost to make these things
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:17.960]   plain and clear. He doesn't speak about himself. He speaks about Jesus Christ, and he glorifies
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:29.280]   him. How can I get rid of this sin? How can I get rid of this stain? How can I get rid
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:38.800]   of this vileness, this pollution? And here comes the answer in this wonderful message.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:46.720]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:54.400]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Did you notice how it was put there
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.040]   in that great tenth chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews which we read together at the
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:06.320]   beginning? "No, no," says that man, "the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.040]   of an heifer cannot really do this thing that's a temporary expedient, just to cover it for
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:18.120]   the time being." Well, how is it done? Well, this is how he puts it. "There is someone
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.280]   who comes into the world and says, 'Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. A body thou
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:34.600]   hast prepared me.'" And that's just a way of telling us that in order to deal with
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:44.400]   this terrible, tragic, appalling problem of our guilt and our vileness and filthiness,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:53.800]   God has sent his only Son into this world. The Lord Jesus Christ came into the world
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:29:00.640]   specifically for this problem of our guilt. He didn't merely come to teach us, he did
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:08.200]   teach. He didn't merely come to give us an example, he does that. But if he'd stopped
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:15.800]   at that, then I say he would have condemned us more than we were already condemned. I
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:21.400]   cannot come up to my own standard, I cannot satisfy myself. I read the lives of saints
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:29.120]   and I feel I'm a pygmy and I'm nothing. And then I look at Jesus of Nazareth and he
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:37.160]   just makes me feel utterly and absolutely hopeless. I read his sermon on the mount and
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.680]   I say, "Who can? Who can live such a life? Who can ascend to such a height? The thing
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.880]   is so exalted, it's all very well to sit back and say, 'What a wonderful life. Now
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.720]   I'm going to follow him. I'm going to go after him and imitate him. I'm going to live
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.960]   like that.'" Have you ever tried it, my friend? You try it and you'll find it utterly
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:08.080]   impossible. He just reveals your weakness. He exposes your sin more than ever. But no,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:16.240]   he didn't come primarily to do those things. The real object of his coming into the world
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:23.080]   was this, again put in this epistle to the Hebrews. He was made a little lower than the
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:34.920]   angels for the suffering of death. He came to taste death for every man. In other words,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   let's put it quite simply and plainly. The problem of the guilt of your sin and mine
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:49.440]   was so great that the Son of God had to come from him. Had you realized that, my friend,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.880]   or had you rather thought this, which so many seem to think still, in spite of this open
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.040]   Bible, that God forgives sin because he's love, that all you and I have to do is to
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.440]   say that we are sorry, and because God is a God of love, he'll forgive us our sins?
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:11.560]   Well, then I ask you, why did the Son of God ever come into this world? Because it was
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:17.400]   known in the Old Testament that God is a God of love, that he's full of mercy and compassion.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.480]   A psalmist can say, "When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:29.520]   me up." They write about his longsuffering, his patience, his compassion, his goodness
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:35.080]   and his kindness and his mercy. All that was known. Why, I ask, did the Son of God leave
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:40.160]   the courts of heaven and come on earth and live and die and rise again? There's only
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:47.720]   one answer. It was absolutely essential. The guilt of years, sin, and mine could not be
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:55.480]   dealt with except in that way. So he came on earth in order to deal with this very problem,
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   this sin that is upon us. And as I say, he didn't help us to solve that merely by living
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:09.920]   as he lived or teaching as he taught. That leaves us still more sinful.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:20.400]   Well how, then? Well, let me summarize it in this form. There is the law of God thundering
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.840]   out its condemnation of sin, demanding that men should live a righteous and a holy life
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:38.520]   in the presence of God. And Jesus Christ came in this body which God had prepared for him.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.840]   He entered into the Virgin's womb, he took human nature from her, added it unto himself,
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:52.600]   and he lived here as a man. And he rendered a perfect obedience to that law of God. He
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:33:04.480]   satisfied its every demand. But even that isn't enough. That's enough, I say, to enable
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:10.480]   us to say that we've kept the law in him, but still there is the problem of the sins
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   committed, the sins of the past. What can be done about them?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:26.200]   Well, here we come to the most wonderful and amazing thing of all. He deliberately identified
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:34.280]   himself with our guilt and our sins. He went to John the Baptist and he said, "Baptize
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:39.720]   me." And John said, "You don't need to be baptized. I need to be baptized of you.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:45.120]   Why do you ask me to baptize you?" He said, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.920]   us to fulfill all righteousness." He identifies himself with us in sin. He makes himself one
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:34:02.680]   of us. He takes his stand by our side. But follow on the story and go and look at him
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   in the garden of Gethsemane. There he is sweating great drops of blood as he says to his father,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:21.640]   "If it be possible, let this cup pass by." What's he talking about? Oh, he's talking
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.800]   about your sins and mine. That's the cup. He has come on earth to deliver us from the
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:35.120]   guilt of our sins. How can it be done? There's only one way. He has got to take them upon
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:44.600]   him. He's got to clothe himself, as it were, with our sins. And God is going to punish
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:52.160]   your sins and mine in the person of his own Son. "If it be possible," he says three
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:58.880]   times, "let this cup pass by. Nevertheless, not thy will, not my will, but thine be done."
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.720]   He has come to save us and yet he asks at the last moment, as it were, "Is this the
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:10.000]   only way? Does it really mean that when you look upon me on that cross you're going
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.360]   to see not so much me as the sins of humanity, and you're going to hate them, and you're
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:25.320]   going to smite them, and thus we'll be separated?" Is it the only way? But it was
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:37.520]   the only way. And on he went. "And there on Calvary God doth laid on him the iniquity
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:46.520]   of us all." Or, as Peter puts it, "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:55.680]   on the tree?" The sins of men were put on him and God punished them. He smote him by
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:10.280]   his stripes. We are healed. His blood was shed, and it is the shedding of his blood
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:21.520]   alone can cleanse us from the guilt and the filthiness and the foulness of our sins. "I
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:29.720]   will sprinkle you," says God, "with clean water." It's his action. Man cannot get
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.280]   rid of his sins. He can't make atonement. He can't undo the past. He can't offer
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:42.160]   anything to God that is satisfactory. There is nothing that is adequate. Man cannot, but
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:54.080]   God can. And God has. And the cleansing is in the blood of Christ, which cleanses from
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:06.320]   all sin and every stain and defilement and pollution. And so God makes us clean and fit
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:16.880]   to come into his presence and gets rid of the guilt of all our sinfulness and vileness
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:26.080]   by shedding the blood of his own Son and sprinkling it upon us.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.600]   Now you see Ezekiel who had been given the sight of all this. He'd seen it all. God
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:36.360]   spoke it to him, and he told him to tell it to the children of Israel. And we have it
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.280]   in all its fullness, no longer in types and shadows. But the thing has happened. It's
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.840]   been done. That's why we're going to drink bread and wine. We're declaring the Lord's
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.520]   death till he comes. Why do we do that? Because it's the only way whereby we can be forgiven.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:58.040]   He said it himself, didn't he? The Son of Man, he said, is not come to be ministered
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:11.280]   unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many. The Good Shepherd lays
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:20.320]   down his life for the sheep. It's the only way.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:30.000]   But I'm anxious to emphasize this before I close, that this way is sufficient. You
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.560]   notice how it's emphasized in our text here back in Ezekiel. Listen to it again. "Then
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:45.960]   will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean." You notice the emphasis?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:57.080]   "From all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you." If you forget
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:06.120]   everything else I've said, try to hold on to this and to remember this. This is a fact.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.480]   Did you notice how here in this tenth of Hebrews once more that quotation is given about the
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.600]   new covenant? He's quoting Jeremiah 31. This is the covenant that I will make with
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.680]   them in those days, saith the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts and in their minds
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:37.240]   will I write them. And listen, "And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:45.000]   And this is the thing that you and I have to realize and to believe. Having laid them
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:55.040]   upon Christ and having punished the sins there and having dealt with them, God has finished
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:04.600]   with them. Their sins and iniquities I will remember no more. He has cast them into the
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:16.920]   sea of His forgetfulness. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.600]   transgressions from us. They've gone in Christ.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   Oh, this is so vital that I must give you some further quotations. Listen to John in
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:35.320]   his first epistle putting it like this. "And all men by now the apostle John knew that
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.800]   his death was at hand." And he writes to these Christians, he wants them to be happy,
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.720]   he wants them to know the joy which he knew as an apostle. He wants them to have fellowship
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.080]   with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. How is it to be done? Well, he says, this
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.400]   is the position. You can have fellowship like that with God while you're in this world.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.760]   You don't have to wait until you're dead and gone to heaven to have fellowship with
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:05.200]   God. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. And I want you
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.360]   to have it and to share in it, says John. Very well, how is it to happen? And then he
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:20.680]   says the most amazing thing. This is the message, that God is light and in him is no darkness
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:29.040]   at all. How can I have fellowship with such a being? What's the use of saying I want
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.560]   you to enjoy the fellowship and to have the happiness, and then you spoil it all by saying,
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:43.520]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all. Because I know that the truth about myself
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:54.200]   is this. Oh, how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose mind is dim, before the ineffable
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:01.440]   appear and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated beam, if God is light and in him is no darkness
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.680]   at all, how can I, who am full of darkness and virilness and ugliness, how can I possibly
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:18.600]   walk with him? Listen. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:33.880]   one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. Yes, as
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.400]   you walk with God through this world, you will fall into sin and you become spotted
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.400]   again and there is the blemish on you and the pollution. Well, then you say, how can
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:49.880]   the fellowship continue? The answer is, the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:59.680]   from all sin. Oh, listen to the Apostle Paul putting it in writing to the Corinthians.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.000]   What a tremendous statement, my friends. Oh, that we might have the power of the Spirit
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.320]   to grasp it this evening. Listen to this in 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:16.200]   Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:23.480]   Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:30.840]   with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners,
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.800]   shall inherit the kingdom of God. People like that shall not have fellowship with God. They
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:45.400]   will never know his blessing. They will never be in his kingdom. Listen. And such were some
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:54.320]   of you. They had been guilty of those things, foul, vile, filthy, in the very dregs and
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:05.000]   gutters, guilty of these horrible, revolting things. Such were some of you. But ye are
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:22.160]   by the Spirit of our God. They were polluted, vile, filthy, but God has said, I will sprinkle
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:31.200]   clean water on you, and you shall be clean. I will wash you. And he washed those Corinthians
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.800]   and made them clean. And they were saints in the church of God and were having fellowship
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:47.200]   with God. Oh, it is in the blood of Christ we are washed. It is only there we can wash
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:54.600]   our sins away and make our garments clean and bright. Oh, says Paul, it is in him we
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:02.360]   have redemption. Through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, God's way of forgiveness and cleansing
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:11.640]   from the guilt of sin is in the blood of Christ. That's the pure water.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   And therefore, you see, it leads to this. And this is why I read that chapter at the
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:32.840]   beginning. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest. That's the question.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:40.800]   How can I enter into the holiest? How can I have an audience with God? How can I speak
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.720]   to God? How can I pray to God? How can I be blessed of God? That's what I want to know.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:53.000]   How can I get at him? There's only one answer. Having therefore, brethren, boldness, confidence,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he has
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.760]   consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. And having a high priest
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:19.400]   over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith,
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:29.360]   having our hearts sprinkled from an evil accusing conscience, and our bodies washed with pure
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.280]   water. I'd like to end by putting that to you in
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:45.640]   the form of a question. When you pray to God, do you do it like that? Do you enter into
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:54.160]   the presence of God with boldness? Do you do so in the full assurance of faith? Do you
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.920]   go to him knowing that your sins are forgiven, and that you are his child, and that he's
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:09.520]   delighted to receive you? That's full assurance of faith. How can I do that, says someone?
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:14.240]   Because when I go on my knees before God, I'm more conscious of my sins and of my sinfulness
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.400]   than at any other time in my life. And I know that I'm a sinner. How can I go with confidence
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:29.120]   and boldness when I know I've sinned? Ah, that's the whole question. If you believe
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:36.760]   this message concerning Jesus Christ and him crucified, you can go in the full assurance
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:45.320]   of faith. Because you say to yourself, "Though I am a sinner, though I am guilty of sins,
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:52.040]   Christ has borne them, has borne their punishment and their guilt. He's taken them away, and
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:58.240]   God will remember them no more. I believe this, so by the blood of Christ I'll go in
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:04.600]   as I am, trusting to his perfect work and his merit, knowing that God will honor his
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:12.880]   word and will receive me." That's the full assurance of faith. It isn't ignoring your
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:19.400]   sins, it's facing them, it's confessing them, it's admitting them, but saying, "Yes,
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:29.720]   but Christ has died for me. His blood can make the foulest clean. His blood availed
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:41.040]   for me." There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins, and sinners
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:52.600]   plunge beneath that flood, lose all their guilty stains. It's the only thing that's
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:59.680]   strong enough and potent enough to take out the stain of sin. But it is enough, and it
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.600]   doesn't matter what you've been. I can't give you a list that is worse than that which
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.800]   Paul gives in 1 Corinthians 6. It includes everybody in this congregation, doesn't
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.920]   it? Have you been a murderer? It doesn't matter. That can be blotted out, that stain
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:22.960]   can be taken out by the blood of Christ, if you but believe he died for you. So don't
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:31.600]   talk about your sins. Don't talk about your fitness any longer or any more. All the fitness
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:44.800]   you require is to feel your need of him. His blood cleanseth from all sin and unrighteousness.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:52.920]   You believe that, and then go in the full assurance and confidence of faith, pleading
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:59.400]   only the blood of Christ shed for you and for your sins. And God will receive you and
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:08.200]   will let you know that your sins and iniquities he will remember no more. I will sprinkle
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:18.440]   clean water upon you, and you shall be clean. When God washes you in the blood of Christ,
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:29.800]   there is no more remembrance of sin. It's gone. Your sins are forgiven in him. And you
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:39.040]   go to God to thank him and to give yourself to him and to pledge yourself to live only
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:46.600]   to his praise, his glory, his honor, who has so loved you that at such a price and at such
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:54.360]   a cost he has ransomed and rescued and redeemed and cleansed you and brought you back unto
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.440]   himself and is now beginning to shower his blessings upon you.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:10.720]   The first question is the guilt of your past sins. And until they are removed, you are
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:23.120]   out of relationship with God. But in Christ and him crucified, you can be reconciled,
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:43.000]   restored, ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven. Who like me his praise should sing? Amen.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.080]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
