[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.040]   Happy New Year and welcome to another episode
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.580]   of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.820]   money and travel.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I'm excited you're here
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280]   for the first episode of 2023.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   I also hope you're feeling better than I am
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.320]   because somehow everyone in our house
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.700]   has gotten a cold or flu twice
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.460]   in the past two and a half weeks.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.800]   But sick or not, I am excited to kick off the new year
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.060]   with another listener question episode.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.740]   We're gonna cover paying down your mortgage,
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.400]   where to put cash savings,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.320]   managing credit cards with your partner,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.020]   booking hotels direct versus the portal,
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.000]   what to do when you're short on points,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.920]   how to save money on data while traveling and more.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.900]   I'm also gonna share some of the listener hacks
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.160]   that you all sent me.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.720]   So let's get right into it after this.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.160]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.680]   about life, money and so much more.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.240]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.920]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.300]   as you build your wealth.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.560]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.420]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.580]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.100]   finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.100]   manufacturing and more.
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.500]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.460]   I've loved being a part of the community
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.780]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.900]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.260]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.980]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.780]   are first generation wealth,
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.880]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.020]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.360]   and learn from each other
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.940]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.240]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.580]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.980]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.140]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.120]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.620]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.060]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.380]   to your children's education,
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.700]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.140]   So many of these conversations
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.040]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.900]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.980]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.140]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.260]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.780]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.740]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.820]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.980]   Okay, to get started,
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.740]   I just wanna share a few amazing listener wins
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.220]   that you guys have sent in.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.340]   It makes me so happy to hear these stories,
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.900]   so keep them coming.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.220]   First, I wanna talk about Chad's story.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.460]   He and his wife hadn't opened a card in over 15 years
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.900]   before listening to the show,
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.660]   and they've now amassed almost 400,000 points.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.860]   And use some of those points for five nights in Ontario,
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.340]   a free Marriott stay,
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.820]   flights for the whole family to Florida.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.220]   And Chad's estimate is that they've not only saved $2,000
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.440]   in travel already,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.420]   but they still have 300,000 points to use.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.860]   He also said that as part of this,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.100]   he and his wife's credit scores
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.580]   have both jumped 20 to 40 points.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.860]   That is awesome, Chad.
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.700]   I love hearing that story.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.640]   Similarly, Prema was able to rack up 100,000 points
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.620]   from a signup bonus
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.420]   and used it to fly her little sister
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.820]   to the States from India for 45,000 miles,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.640]   which saved her almost $1,200.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.760]   She said she got this taste of points and miles,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.860]   and now she wants more.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.480]   So I hope 2023 brings you even more points.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.980]   After talking about unclaimed money,
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.780]   I got a message from a listener who looked and found $93,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.020]   which was cool,
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.980]   but he got obsessed and started checking out
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.660]   all of his friends and family
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.140]   and ended up finding over $1,000 for everyone.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.660]   One of his friends actually had $500 owed just to him.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.660]   He'd never even heard of it before and is so excited.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.500]   If you're listening to this
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.820]   and haven't already checked for unclaimed money yourself,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.420]   search for unclaimed money and the name of your state
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.820]   and go to that site and see what you're owed.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.460]   I got another email from Amy who said she emailed a hotel
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   just like we've talked about on the show a lot
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.980]   and told them she was excited for her upcoming stay.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.060]   And when they arrived, she got upgraded to a corner suite.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.020]   They had a cool present for her kid
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.860]   and a fancy box of chocolates for the adults.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.780]   And they comped their parking, which was $70 a day.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.660]   So if you're listening
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500]   and you're not booking hotels direct and sending a note,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.620]   you definitely should because you never know
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.100]   if you're gonna get hooked up like Amy did.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.060]   And finally, Michael heard my story on the London episode
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.980]   about saving money on Airbnbs.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.000]   And so he messaged the host of a property
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.780]   that was a little out of his price range
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.180]   and was able to get 15% off and booked it immediately.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.980]   And he said that since this is all the hacks,
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.600]   he went and bought a $500 Airbnb gift card on Amazon
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.980]   with his Chase Amazon card to get 5% cash back
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.340]   before booking the rest on his Sapphire Reserve
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220]   for three X points.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.620]   Awesome job, Michael.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.580]   I hope everyone that's booking Airbnbs
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.140]   is doing their best to negotiate a better deal.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.900]   So those are just a few of the wins
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900]   I've gotten from you all.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.900]   Please send them in.
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.300]   I love hearing stories like that.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.060]   But I also wanna share some of the great deals
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.380]   and hacks that you guys have sent in as well.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.460]   So first off, Skylar wrote in and listened to a few episodes
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.860]   where I've said that really some of the only great deals
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.100]   for points on hotels is Hyatt.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.340]   And he wanted to point out that that's not always the case.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.620]   If you have Citi or Capital One points,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.820]   he's been able to transfer them to Wyndham
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   and get a really good deal
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.220]   using them with the VACASA program.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.300]   And when I say good deal,
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.260]   he's been getting two to four cents per point,
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.900]   including a nice place he just booked
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.060]   for a winter weekend in Tahoe.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.540]   He also said there's some good deals
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.780]   transferring from Citi to Choice
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.620]   when you get a one to two ratio,
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.660]   and especially when you're traveling in Scandinavia,
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.860]   or if you're using the points
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.220]   to book their preferred resorts and hotels,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.420]   though he's never done the latter
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.940]   because as good of a deal as it is,
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.860]   it can kind of be a headache to book.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.580]   So if you're thinking about
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.020]   how you could use your points for hotels,
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.620]   definitely consider checking out the Wyndham VACASA program
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.340]   or some of the Choice hotels
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.540]   and see if you can get as a good deal as Skylar.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.300]   Thank you so much for sending that in.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.980]   Also, Manny sent in a great hack
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.420]   for transportation to the airport
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.100]   on your last day in the city.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.700]   It turns out that sometimes it's actually cheaper
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.780]   to do a one-way car rental from the city to the airport
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.560]   than it is to pay for a Lyft or Uber to get there.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.500]   But if you have a late flight and an early checkout,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.260]   it can actually be even better
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.700]   because you can rent a car in the morning,
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.860]   go and tour the city, go stop off,
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.220]   go see interesting stuff,
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.860]   and then drop it off at the airport
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.180]   and not have to pay to shuttle yourself around,
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.860]   have a place to store your bags,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.000]   and it makes everything easier and you can save money.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.300]   That's an awesome suggestion.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.000]   I hope some people can get some good value there.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.780]   Finally, Nirav wanted to recommend
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.620]   that people check out
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.140]   the Cashback Comparison browser extension
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.940]   because it compares the cashback rates
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.880]   from all kinds of sites like Rakuten and Top Cashback.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.580]   I know in the past I've suggested Cashback Monitor,
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.300]   but just having something on the browser
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.420]   saves you even more time,
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.260]   so Nirav, thanks for that suggestion.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.220]   All right, those are some great hacks.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.180]   I really hope you guys keep sending them in
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.620]   and I'll keep sharing them
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.100]   because I know everyone listening
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.060]   loves hearing new ways to save.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.640]   So let's jump into questions.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.160]   First, I wanna tackle two questions
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.740]   that are very similar from Gavin and Matt.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.260]   Both of them had a rough question
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.100]   about paying down your mortgage
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.520]   to reduce your monthly payments.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.660]   One of the questions was about
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.540]   whether it makes sense to pay it down
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.860]   or to invest that money
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.200]   and take the growth and income from those investments
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.740]   to make your mortgage payments.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.260]   And the other was about whether it makes sense
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.380]   to withdraw money from a retirement account
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.320]   like a Roth IRA or a brokerage account
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.940]   to pay down your mortgage
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.140]   so you can lower your monthly payments.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.880]   So I know I've talked about this in the past,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.620]   but mortgage rates were 2% or 3% back then,
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.300]   so I think it's worth bringing this up again
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.020]   now that mortgage rates are in the high single digits.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.820]   However, I wanna point out a few things.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.300]   So one, mortgage interest in the US
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.100]   for a mortgage up to $750,000,
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.380]   if you itemize on your taxes, is tax deductible.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.940]   So even if you're paying 7%,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.620]   if you itemize your taxes,
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.940]   that 7% is probably reduced by anywhere
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.220]   from a third to half,
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.580]   depending on what state you're in
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.180]   and what your tax bracket's in.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.180]   So if you look at the average long-term return
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.580]   of a portfolio, anywhere from the 5% to 8%,
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.620]   I'm guessing that after your tax deductibility
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.820]   of your mortgage interest,
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.740]   you're at about break-even.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.460]   However, there's one important thing to consider,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.600]   and that's that your mortgage can be refinanced.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.700]   So just because your mortgage today is at 5% or 8%
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.220]   doesn't mean that interest rates might not drop
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.500]   and you might be able to refinance
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.980]   at 3% or 4% in a few years.
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.700]   So for me, even at high interest rates today,
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.060]   I still don't like the option of paying down your mortgage,
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.100]   especially if it means taking money
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.020]   out of a tax-advantaged account,
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.580]   and even more so if it means paying penalties or fees.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.820]   All that said, this is much more of an emotional
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.020]   than a rational decision,
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.560]   and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.700]   There are a lot of people out there
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.020]   that I know are so stressed out every day and week
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.420]   just thinking about the fact that they have debt
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.900]   and knowing that they could live in their home
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.140]   with no mortgage payment in the future
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.660]   is something that could bring them such satisfaction
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.060]   and emotional comfort that even if it's not
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.380]   the perfect optimal thing to do,
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.180]   it might still be the right thing for them to do.
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.940]   So like I said, there's no perfect answer,
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.820]   but in general, if you can deduct the interest
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.340]   on your mortgage, I think at rates today,
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.220]   I would still rather put the money in the market
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.700]   for the long-term and make my regular mortgage payments,
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.500]   and if and when rates go down,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.480]   refinance to lock in a lower rate.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.640]   Next, I got a question from Chelsea
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.560]   about where to put money that they're saving
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.900]   for a big trip to Europe in three years.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.380]   She asked whether it makes sense to put it in savings,
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.040]   in index funds, in the market, or what makes sense,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.980]   because she doesn't wanna be too risky,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.980]   but she also doesn't want it to just sit and not grow.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.100]   A few years ago, this might have been a harder question
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.400]   because the interest rates were so low on savings accounts
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.540]   that it really made it tough to leave your money in cash
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.080]   earning 0.1 or 0.2%.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.900]   But my general rule of thumb has been
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.340]   that for anything you need in the next five years,
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.940]   don't put it in the market.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.580]   And the reason is simple.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.340]   The stock market is volatile enough
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.340]   that at any given point in time,
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.860]   you could see your portfolio,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.200]   depending on how risky your portfolio is, down 10, 20, 30%.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.300]   And in years past, those things have lasted multiple years.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.580]   If you look at the market right now,
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.580]   for at least a year, your portfolio has probably been down.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.880]   And if this is money that you need
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   in a specific period of time that's less than five years,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.060]   you don't wanna be in a situation where the market's down
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.980]   and you don't have the money you need.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.420]   And this goes for a down payment in a few years, a trip,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.460]   any kind of major purchase or investment,
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.060]   or maybe you wanna quit your job to start a company
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.420]   or do something on your own or take a year off.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.220]   So my advice here is to keep the money in cash.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.020]   And fortunately, right now, there are a lot of great options
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.900]   for where you can put money in cash and earn high yield.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.760]   If you already have all the money you need right now,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   then a great option might be to use
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.000]   one of the brokered CD options
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.280]   from Schwab, Vanguard, or Fidelity,
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.700]   which currently are up to 4.9%
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.960]   for durations of anywhere from 10 to 24 months.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.240]   However, you have to actually have the money now.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.040]   So if this is a trip that you wanna take
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   and you're gonna be saving for it over the next three years,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   then a CD might not be the best option
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.680]   'cause you don't have the money now.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.560]   And instead, I would open up a cash account
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.280]   where you can earn high yield on your cash
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.120]   while everything is FDIC insured
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.440]   and you're not taking any risk in the market.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.800]   For me, I have mine at Wealthfront where I'm getting 3.8%.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.680]   I know that there are some options out there
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.320]   that are at 4%, 4.05, 4.1,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.000]   but one of the things I learned at Wealthfront,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.200]   and we actually wrote a blog post about this,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.720]   is that if you're always chasing the best rates
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.160]   and moving your money between different accounts,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.120]   you actually lose out a lot
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.800]   by having your money in transit
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.680]   because you're not earning interest when it's in transit.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.880]   So let's pretend that you decide
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.760]   you always wanna get the best rate,
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.840]   and once a quarter, you're gonna transfer your money
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.520]   from one bank to the next bank,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   and those ACH transfers take a week each time.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   So you're gonna miss out on four weeks of interest
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.600]   over the course of the year,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.500]   which is about 7.5% of the year.
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.420]   So if you're saying that the average rate
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.240]   for a super optimized account is 4.1%
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.880]   and you miss out on 7.5% of the year,
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.720]   you're effectively gonna earn 3.79% for the year anyways.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.920]   So for me, I have watched how Wealthfront operates,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.640]   I've seen the rates they've had,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.360]   they're always consistently raising when the Fed raises.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.040]   So for me, it's just easier to keep it in one place
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   that I'm confident will go up as rates rise.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.040]   There are other banks and institutions you could check out
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.560]   that might do the same thing,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.040]   but I'll link to the show notes,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.880]   the article about rate chasing,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.120]   but I just don't think it's always the best
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.880]   to go pick a random bank that has a high APY right now,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.960]   because if you're constantly having to move around,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   you actually lose out more in the long run.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.080]   So in general, for short-term savings,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.200]   less than five years,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.720]   especially right now with high interest rates,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.600]   I would go high yield cash or high yield savings
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.720]   for anything that I'm contributing to regularly.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.360]   And if it's money that I've already saved
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.680]   and I just wanna hold onto it,
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.760]   I'd be looking at some of these brokered CDs
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.440]   that are a little bit higher yield,
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.960]   but you have to lock your money up
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.240]   for anywhere from 10 to 24 months.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.480]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.120]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.040]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.480]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.200]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.760]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.160]   to help protect your family

[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.760]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents

[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.040]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy

[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.000]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.560]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.600]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   not available in certain states,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.000]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.880]   Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.360]   I started taking AG1 from Athletic Greens
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.840]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.800]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.720]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.240]   And it's been in my routine for almost a year
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.560]   because when you take one scoop of AG1,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.720]   you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.080]   whole food source superfoods, probiotics,
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.200]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.240]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.440]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.960]   and energized for the day,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.480]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.240]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.960]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.760]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.800]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one year supply
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.680]   of immune supporting vitamin D
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.160]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.040]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.680]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.320]   to take ownership over your health
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.960]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.480]   Okay, so I wanna move on to some travel and points stuff.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.960]   And Scott wrote in saying he's getting married next year,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.420]   so congrats, and he's wondering what he should do
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.760]   to get the most out of points with his partner.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.200]   He asked if he should add her to his platinum card
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.320]   or if he should refer her to get her own.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.400]   And this becomes an interesting question.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.280]   So I'll talk a little bit about how we do it.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.280]   In general, there's two ways to approach this
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.880]   and you can kind of combine them.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   One is around signup bonuses.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.200]   And if there's a card with a really big signup bonus,
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.800]   then for us, we try to get it twice
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.340]   so we can maximize the points that we can earn.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.160]   But when it comes to keeping the card over the long term,
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.800]   we try not to have two of the same card,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.100]   unless for some reason, the rare case that there's a card
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.520]   where the perks and credits and benefits of that card
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.700]   far outweigh the annual fee
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.100]   and it actually makes sense to have two of them.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.720]   That's usually not the case.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.920]   So in general, we try to make sure
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.440]   that we just have each card once.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.000]   But if there's a huge signup bonus,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.760]   we might both open it to get the bonus.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.760]   Now with Chase, Citi, and Capital One,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.320]   it's really easy to transfer your points
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.760]   between your partner.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.140]   So if you both were to open up a Capital One card
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.360]   and let's take the Venture or the Venture X card
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.660]   and get 75,000 points right now,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.160]   you could actually transfer those 75
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   plus whatever points you earn on the card
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.140]   as you meet the minimum spend into one account
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.540]   and then either keep that card open or downgrade it.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.060]   Obviously, I would always recommend
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.580]   waiting until the end of the year
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.800]   to talk about downgrading and canceling.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.280]   You don't want any of the card issuers to look at you
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.000]   and say, "Oh, you're the person that opened the card,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.120]   "got the bonus and shut it down right away."
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.780]   So reminder, you can go back to listen
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.660]   to some old Q&A episodes where I've talked exactly
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.320]   about how I think about when to close cards.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.340]   But in general, if you open up the same two cards
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.980]   to get the bonus, there's no point
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.120]   in keeping both of them active unless the rare case
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.420]   that the annual fee is lower
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.260]   than the value you get from the card.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.700]   I think the big exception to this is
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.680]   if you're in the military and all of your annual fees
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.720]   are waived, then by all means, having both cards
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.040]   for both spouses might make a lot of sense
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.920]   because you're able to take all the perks
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.140]   and all the benefits without paying the annual fees.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.060]   I will say that with Amex, there is no way
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.140]   to transfer points to another person.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.860]   So just know that if you and your partner both open up
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.540]   an Amex, unless you use the points,
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.260]   you're not gonna be able to combine those points
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.660]   into one account if you keep only one card open.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.460]   Next, I wanna address a question from Olivia
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.740]   about opening up airline accounts.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.460]   So she asked if she should open up a frequent flyer account
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.820]   for every airline that she can transfer points to
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.980]   from her credit card.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.820]   So before I answer, I wanna draw an important distinction
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.100]   between opening up the accounts
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.160]   and actually moving points into them.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.060]   So I definitely don't think you should move any points
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.200]   out of your Amex, Chase, Cap One, Citi, Balances,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.160]   to other airlines until you're ready to book.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.500]   But there are a few airlines where you can't transfer points
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.580]   to them unless the account has been active for 24 hours
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.720]   or three days or one week, different rules like that.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.180]   So I would say that maybe it doesn't have to be right away,
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.280]   but as soon as you start thinking about planning a trip,
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.340]   at some point I would go and open up a frequent flyer account
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.640]   for at least the airlines you're considering booking through.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.060]   At a minimum, I think depending on which credit card
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.060]   you have, airlines like Air France, United, British Airways,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.020]   even maybe Avios are all airlines
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.980]   that I've opened up accounts at even before I needed them,
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.760]   just so that I had them ready to go.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.140]   It also helps that when you open up those accounts,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.640]   you're able to search for flights on their websites.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.160]   Some airlines will let you do it without being logged in,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.060]   but most need you to be logged in.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.200]   So because it's easy, because it doesn't cost anything,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.780]   I've gone ahead for myself and opened up accounts
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.240]   at most of the major airlines I think I'd use
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.460]   just to have on hand.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.040]   Now Charles asked a similar question,
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.980]   which was whether it makes sense to go open up
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.100]   frequent flyer accounts for all of your children
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.240]   or whether it's not worth it.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.820]   So every time we're flying on a flight
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.320]   that we bought seats on, because you don't earn points
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.380]   when you're booking your flight with miles
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.960]   through the airline, but if you're using your points
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.780]   to book in the portal, you will.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.780]   So if I'm booking in the portal, or if I'm paying cash
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.560]   for any seats for a child, not a lap infant,
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.740]   but actual seats, I'm gonna go in
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.140]   and I'm gonna create a frequent flyer account for my kids.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.420]   And I know that the miles aren't that big
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.500]   and they're obviously not earning extra bonuses
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.580]   from credit cards and that kind of stuff,
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.120]   but I think over the next 15 or 20 years,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.140]   it'll add up to something.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.380]   While it might not be enough right away for a free flight,
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.800]   you can at some point add them as an authorized cardholder
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.240]   to your Chase or Amex account,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.740]   and that'll let you transfer points into their accounts.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.820]   So let's say you need 50,000 United Miles
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.400]   for a round trip ticket that you're taking somewhere,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.800]   and your kid has racked up 5,000.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.240]   Well, now you're only gonna need to transfer 45,000
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.800]   to their account instead of the full 50,000.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.960]   So for me, I've created accounts for our two-year-old.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.120]   I haven't yet created one for our six-month-old
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.320]   because we haven't bought her a seat on a flight.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.640]   It's always been a lap infant, but in the future I will,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.820]   and hopefully we'll rack up enough points
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.500]   that maybe by the time they get to college,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.480]   they've got a few free flights they can take.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.100]   And I know I mentioned a little bit
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.960]   about booking on the portal versus not,
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   so I'm gonna answer a question
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.940]   that I've probably answered before,
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.040]   but Carl, Tontesh, and Jessica all wrote in questions
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.560]   about booking hotels
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.800]   and whether it makes sense to do it in the portal.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.080]   And I think the big confusion here
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.600]   is that many of the cards and travel portals
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.400]   offer huge bonuses for booking hotels
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.480]   and sometimes flights in their portal.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.840]   So you can get as many as 10 points per dollar
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.400]   booking a hotel in different portals
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.100]   depending on the card you have.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.720]   So I wanna clarify when it makes sense and when it doesn't
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.240]   because it can be a little bit confusing.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.280]   So your chances of getting an upgrade
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.200]   if you book in the portal are almost zero.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.440]   Hotels and hotel chains really don't love bookings
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.120]   that come through a lot of these portals,
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.680]   and so they're not gonna treat you
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.040]   anywhere nearly as well as they would
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.560]   if you booked directly with the hotel
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.520]   and especially if you created an account
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.280]   in their loyalty program.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.920]   Also, depending on the hotel chain,
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.960]   you might not actually earn any points
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.240]   or elite night status when you book through the portal.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.000]   So if those are important to you,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.960]   you don't wanna book in the portal.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.300]   Also, sometimes the rates that you get
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.840]   on a website for a hotel,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.040]   especially if you're logged in as one of their members,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.100]   might be better.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.480]   So in general, I would say,
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.600]   I would never try to book on a portal website
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.320]   to get 10x points if I'm gonna pay a rate that's 20% more.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.540]   Finally, in the portal, you're subject to
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.920]   dealing with chase or whatever travel portal you book in
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.480]   when it comes to changing and cancellations,
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.940]   which can be more strict.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.040]   Sometimes dealing directly with the hotel
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.200]   is gonna get you a little bit further
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.080]   if something goes wrong in the last minute
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.300]   or you need to make a change.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.760]   And finally, some travel portals do charge a service fee.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.320]   Amex used to do this a lot.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.240]   I can't remember if they still do,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.480]   but obviously keep in mind
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.820]   whether there's a fee to do anything.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.100]   All that said, if the price is the same
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.900]   and you're booking at a hotel
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.440]   where you don't really earn points
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.480]   or you don't care about status and the rate is the same,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.480]   and you're pretty confident
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.720]   that you're not gonna need to cancel or change it,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.400]   and you can earn 10 points per dollar
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.720]   booking in the chase portal
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.940]   or earn nothing on the hotel website, I'm all for it.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.160]   So especially if it's boutique hotels
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.400]   or the kinds of hotels where they're not part of Marriott
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.020]   or Hyatt and you're earning points or status,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.000]   those could be good opportunities.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.560]   But again, you're not gonna be able to email the hotel
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.480]   and ask for an upgrade like Amy did
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.980]   at the beginning of this episode.
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.480]   So it really depends what's more important to you.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   Is it earning a few more points or is it getting upgraded?
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.360]   When I'm traveling for a conference by myself,
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.080]   I don't care if I have a big room,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.680]   I just need a bed to sleep in.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.360]   And so that would be a good example of the kind of stay
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.360]   where I don't really need the upgrade.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.480]   And if the closest hotel is not part of a chain,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.000]   I might book in the portal to earn 10X points.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.160]   It's much more the exception than the norm.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.020]   On the topic of transfers, Olivia had a follow-up,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.440]   which was if more than one of her credit card programs
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   transfer to the same airline,
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.320]   for example, Bilt and Capital One,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.680]   and actually almost everyone
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.000]   is a transfer partner of Flying Blue,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.240]   can she transfer 50,000 Bilt points
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.680]   and 50,000 Capital One points
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.800]   to the same Flying Blue account and make it 100,000?
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.720]   And the answer is absolutely,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.760]   which is actually one of the reasons I love Flying Blue,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.000]   because they are a transfer partner
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.760]   of almost every credit card.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.660]   So if you've earned some Capital One points
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.760]   and some Chase points,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   and you're trying to figure out how you can book,
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.880]   one option, which I always say is,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.520]   well, you don't have to book the round trip
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.080]   from any specific program.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.060]   So if you have points and the best deal
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.640]   is to transfer your Chase points to United,
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.600]   you could transfer to United to book one way
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.040]   and then use your Amex points,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.720]   which don't transfer to United,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.520]   to transfer to another airline to book the return.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.440]   But with Flying Blue,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.820]   because they're a transfer partner
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.760]   of almost every credit card program,
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.940]   you can transfer points from all the programs
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.620]   into the same account and be able to book from there.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.560]   So yes, Olivia, you can do that.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   It's something I've done in the past,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.540]   and I think it's a great way to take advantage
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.980]   of having miles across different accounts.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.040]   And it's especially something to consider
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.540]   even if you have like a small balance somewhere.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.560]   So if you have a card
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.440]   where maybe you only have 10,000 Amex points from a card
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.720]   and you're booking something,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.320]   even though you might have all the points you need
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.960]   in your Chase account to transfer to Flying Blue,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.880]   it might be a good opportunity to transfer out that balance
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.640]   and then top it up with whatever you need
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.840]   from your Chase account
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.240]   so that you can clear out those small balances.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.400]   Because sometimes I've talked to people
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.640]   who have a card open and they've got five, 10, 15,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.080]   20,000 points and they don't know
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.240]   how they're gonna use them,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.600]   but they don't wanna lose them.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   So they keep that account open forever.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.200]   And when it comes time to book,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.320]   if they need 50,000 points,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.160]   they always think,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.680]   "Oh, well, I can't use the points from that card
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.120]   because it's not enough."
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.760]   But for a program like Flying Blue and British Airways
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.960]   and a few other airlines that are transfer partners
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.920]   of a lot of different credit cards,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.880]   that's a great opportunity to use them.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.000]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.720]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.560]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.160]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.720]   without our consent.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.480]   I found a listing for my dad
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.640]   on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.760]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.480]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.520]   And that was just one of the 69 listings
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.000]   that had his info.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.160]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.960]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.120]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.360]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete Me from Avine
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.320]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.640]   with them for this episode.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.440]   Delete Me is an amazing service
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.200]   that will not just find and remove
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.080]   your personal information from over 500
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.160]   data broker websites, but they'll continuously scan
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.280]   for new data that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.240]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.600]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.840]   in their first two years, and to date,
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.000]   they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.920]   for their customers.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.000]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.480]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.520]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:19.040]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.880]   I don't know about you, but I'm using the new year
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.680]   as an excuse to get fitness back in my routine,
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.840]   and if you're gonna work out,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.200]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.440]   which I think is Viore, and I'm excited
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.620]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.040]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.440]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.120]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.000]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.960]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.980]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.440]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.880]   And it's not just for men.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.440]   My wife Amy is just as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.360]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.040]   I have a few pairs, and they're probably
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.500]   the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.640]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.680]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.040]   and they could be used for just about any activity,
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.320]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.800]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.660]   or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.720]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.040]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.640]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.240]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/viore.

[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.840]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.540]   I just wanna thank you, Qwik,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.840]   for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.680]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.520]   Now, sometimes you're actually short on miles,
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.000]   and Candy wrote in asking what to do
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.960]   because she wants to plan a trip to Spain in April,
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.000]   and she's 10,000 points shy of the round-trip fare for two.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.720]   She knows she'll have the points by the time she goes,
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.360]   but she doesn't have them now,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.560]   and she doesn't wanna necessarily wait.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.080]   So what is the workaround?
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.080]   Now, I don't know what airlines we're talking about
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   or how many points she needs in total,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.160]   but there are a few options depending on those things.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.320]   So one is you could just buy the points.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.920]   So let's say her trip is gonna be 150,000 points
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.600]   and she's 10,000 shy.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.340]   She could go and buy the extra 10,000 points
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:50.120]   on whatever airline it is.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.200]   Now, that's not always gonna be the best deal.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.920]   On United, for example, buying 10,000 miles
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.640]   would cost you $350 plus tax,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.360]   but if that entire trip is going to be the kind of trip
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.000]   where you're gonna save two, three, four, five,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.080]   or maybe it's in business class
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.500]   and you're gonna save 10 or $20,000,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.900]   well, maybe the $350 to make it happen now
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.620]   without having to wait is worth it.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.240]   Another option is if you can find someone
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.780]   that can let you borrow the points.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.580]   Now, transferring points to people can sometimes cost money,
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.400]   usually never as much as buying the points directly,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.420]   but can also sometimes be free.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.720]   So if you need an extra 10,000 Capital One points,
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.500]   you could actually transfer Capital One points
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.940]   from any cardholder to any other cardholder,
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.820]   whether they're related or not.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.620]   So if you're shy 10,000 Capital One points
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.200]   and you know someone that has them,
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.440]   you might be able to do that.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.980]   To keep to the United example,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.980]   transferring 10,000 miles to another person costs 150
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.860]   instead of 350 to buy them,
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.420]   so that might be a better deal.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.620]   So one option that might not work for everyone,
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.440]   but if you had the cashflow to be able to pre-buy things,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.740]   so let's say you need an extra 10,000 points
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.720]   and you have an Amex Gold card,
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.340]   could you go to the grocery store
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:03.620]   and buy five $500 gift cards
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.420]   for retailers that you use regularly,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.380]   whether it's Amazon, gas, groceries,
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.080]   anything that you know you're gonna spend.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.400]   I'm not recommending you buy gift cards that you don't need,
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.260]   but if you're able to buy five $500 gift cards,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.280]   that's $2,500, you're getting four X points
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.960]   at the grocery store so you'd earn 10,000 points.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.540]   Similarly, for example, if you had a card
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.620]   like the Capital One Venture X card
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.620]   and you were to put a payment to the IRS on,
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.780]   the fee that they often charge is a little under 2%,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.740]   so for $10,000, you'd be paying a fee of about $200
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.660]   to be able to put that purchase on your card
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   and you would earn those 10,000 points.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.660]   So it really depends on which card
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.980]   and which way you wanna generate points,
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:54.140]   but those are a few of the options that you have right now.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.380]   Last one on the points side is,
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.940]   I got an email from Sandra asking
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.140]   if I could review the PNC Points card
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.820]   and she was excited because it said
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.220]   it gives four points per dollar,
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.860]   which seems higher than every card
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.620]   and wanted to know what I thought.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.500]   Well, I'll give the award to the PNC Points card
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.580]   for the most deceptive marketing
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.400]   because they say four points per dollar, which is great.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.640]   In the average card, four points per dollar
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.220]   is an awesome return.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.940]   However, when you look at the value of those points,
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.880]   they're anywhere from 0.1 to 0.3 cents per point,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.500]   which on average, you're getting
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.640]   about 0.25 cents per point.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.820]   So you're earning four points per dollar,
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.540]   but those points are worth 25 cents,
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.740]   so you're earning about an average of 1% return.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.760]   They do have some bonuses depending on
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.500]   what kind of PNC account you have
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.900]   and how much money's in it,
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.420]   but at a maximum, you're gonna be earning
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.380]   effectively 1.75% back.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.400]   So for me, I'd much rather at a minimum
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.780]   use a 2% cash back card like the Citi Double Cash
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.580]   or more realistically, I'd rather earn points
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.020]   and a card like the Venture or the VentureX card
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.380]   is gonna earn you two X points on everything,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.180]   which means that at a minimum,
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.300]   it's effectively a 2% cash back card,
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.460]   so better than the PNC points card.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.020]   But if you look at, for example,
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.160]   the points guy values Capital One points at 1.85 cents.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.040]   So if you're getting two points at 1.85 cents,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.060]   you're effectively getting 3.7% cash back.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.720]   So I'm a much bigger fan of almost every other card
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.100]   than this card, so don't fall prey to their marketing
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.100]   making you think you're getting four valuable points
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.080]   per dollar because unfortunately, you are not.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.220]   And I've said this before, but I'll say it again
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.740]   because I really appreciate all the support you guys give.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.620]   If you're signing up for new cards
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:40.700]   and wanna support the show and me,
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.060]   go to allthehacks.com/cards and sign up for your card there.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.840]   It really helps us out.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.820]   That said, if you find a better bonus
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.300]   or your friend can refer you and you can get a better deal,
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.460]   I want you to have the most points possible.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.340]   So do that instead, but if all deals are the same,
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.500]   allthehacks.com/cards would be greatly appreciated.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.640]   Now, moving on to a couple travel questions
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.920]   before we wrap up.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.000]   The biggest one was from Diane and Drew,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.540]   both trying to figure out how they can save money
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.920]   while they're traveling on data.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   So I'll give you guys a few options that I think are great.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.440]   So one, there are a few carriers in the US,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.360]   Google Fi and T-Mobile being the primary two,
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.520]   that actually include free international data.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.500]   So I believe Google Fi's data internationally
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:27.800]   is a little bit faster.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.360]   I have a T-Mobile plan, and while the data's free
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.760]   internationally, it's a little bit slow,
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   but keep in mind, I don't have a fancy T-Mobile plan.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   It's like a $20 a month, two gigabyte plan.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.040]   I think if you have a fancier unlimited plan,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.160]   you'll probably get higher speed data while traveling.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.340]   So that's one option,
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.540]   but not everyone wants to switch their carrier.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.520]   One of the things we do is we're on a Verizon family plan,
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.280]   and we're on the 5G Do More plan.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.200]   And the thing I love about that plan is that every month,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.280]   you get one free travel pass day on your Verizon account.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.840]   You can accrue up to 12.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.960]   At 12, it caps off, but when we recently went to London,
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.040]   we each had accrued 12, and so fortunately,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.000]   when we were in Paris and London for exactly 12 days,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.040]   we just used our 12 travel pass days,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.440]   so we were able to use our phones,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.480]   we were able to do high speed data,
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   and we didn't have to pay for anything.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.940]   Now, if you're gonna be traveling more than 12 days a year,
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.320]   it's not a great option,
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.180]   because you'll run out of travel pass days.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.040]   So on a trip to Europe last year,
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.860]   we actually searched on Amazon,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.140]   and there's an orange SIM card you can buy
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.840]   that includes, I think it was 10 gigabytes of data
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.320]   and some texts and some phone calls for $38
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.200]   and worked all over Europe.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.460]   And right now, I'm looking,
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.840]   and it looks like it actually includes
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   20 gigabytes right now, so you can get 20 gigs for $40.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.340]   So that's one option that I think was great.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.480]   The other is to use an eSIM.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.320]   And I know that Diana actually tried this
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.680]   and had some struggles, so I reached out
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.240]   and asked people where the best eSIM store was.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.760]   And shout out to Paul Stamato,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.120]   a friend of mine @stammy on Twitter,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.600]   who shared that the Aerolo eSIM store was fantastic.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.280]   So in his case, he actually got a 10 gig eSIM for Europe
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.080]   for only $16, and it worked great.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.160]   So I'll put a link to that in the show notes,
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.920]   but the way it works is you used to have to buy a SIM card
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.240]   and actually physically put it in your phone.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.280]   And the orange SIMs I mentioned for Europe
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.000]   that you can buy on Amazon are that.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.280]   It's a physical SIM card you have to put in.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.760]   But with eSIMs, for a phone that supports it,
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.200]   you can actually add the SIM card to your phone
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.840]   without having to put anything in it.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.700]   So at any of these websites,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.520]   you can actually sign up for a new carrier
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.160]   and get an eSIM and add it to your account
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.200]   and actually run it simultaneously
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.080]   alongside your main carrier.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.520]   In fact, one thing I did just to give me the most option
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.400]   was I actually transferred my Verizon account
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.920]   from a physical SIM card to an eSIM.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.680]   And I did this actually last year
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.560]   because I bought this SIM card
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.320]   for going to Europe on Amazon.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.880]   I wanted to be able to put it in my phone,
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.320]   but still have my Verizon account active,
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.620]   even though I'd turned data roaming off.
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.960]   So I definitely recommend if you want the most flexibility
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.660]   to transfer your domestic carrier
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.860]   onto your phone as an eSIM,
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.680]   so you can free up the SIM card spot
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.120]   just in case you need it while you're traveling.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.920]   But now that it's so easy to get eSIMs
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.600]   around the world, especially at a marketplace like Aerolo,
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.960]   that would be my option.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.200]   And that's probably what we'll do going forward
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.160]   if we're traveling any more
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.760]   than the 12 days we get for free each year with Verizon.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   Finally, I wanna talk about storing photos
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.160]   because Jordan asked what I do
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.120]   to organize, store, and manage your photos.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.240]   And frankly, I'll share what I do,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.120]   but I would also love anyone who has a better suggestion
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.600]   because there are a few problems with the solution we have.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.360]   So our current option, and we all have iPhones,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.280]   is that we just have the two terabyte iCloud plan.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.840]   And we take all our photos, we store them all on our phone,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.000]   and that's it.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.520]   It's super straightforward.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.880]   Before that, I used Flickr,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.740]   and it was just a lot of hassle to manage
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.320]   because you have to get all your photos up there,
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.580]   you have to upload them.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.620]   I felt like some of the data was getting lost,
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.760]   whether it was live photos or videos or the location data.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.840]   I haven't really tried Google Photos for a long time,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.500]   so maybe this is the answer.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.280]   But let me explain the biggest benefits and problems
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.240]   with the iCloud option.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   So the greatest thing is that
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.840]   everything's just super seamless.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   I take all my photos, it's great.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.240]   We actually travel sometimes with a physical camera.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.880]   I throw the SD card in, I import them
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.800]   to Apple Photos on my Mac,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.100]   and all the photos show up there as well.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.600]   It's super simple.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.420]   The one thing that's really frustrating,
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.800]   and I don't think I have a great solution,
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.760]   is that Amy, my wife, is always asking for my photos.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.160]   And I wish there was some way
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.840]   that I could just give her access to the entire library
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.440]   so that I don't have to create a shared album every time
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.600]   and upload all the photos.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.080]   And I don't think there's any easy way to do that.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.920]   So that is my one gripe.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.360]   If there were a solution that made that easier,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.800]   I would absolutely switch
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.000]   because just recently we went to London and Paris,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.760]   and Amy's asking me where are all the photos.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.040]   And it seems so silly to create a shared album
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.480]   and transfer basically hundreds of photos
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.120]   into that shared album.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.800]   But I don't think it necessarily uses extra space,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.560]   so maybe that's just the answer.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.040]   But it's the best thing we've found so far,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.480]   and it's what we're doing.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.120]   Okay, I know there are a few other questions.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.280]   If you've emailed in and I haven't gotten to them,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.360]   I will try to get to them in the future.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.080]   If it's been more than a few months, please reach back out.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.280]   I might've lost the email, I might've forgot,
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.200]   but I really do try hard to respond
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.760]   to every single one of the questions you guys write in.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.440]   Finally, before we wrap,
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.840]   if anyone has a Chase Freedom card,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.600]   don't forget that it's Q1
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.280]   and you can go activate 5X points.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.720]   This quarter, it's grocery stores, fitness clubs,
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.560]   gym memberships, and Target.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.400]   So just a friendly reminder there.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.600]   That's all for this week.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.520]   See you next week.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.000]   (birds chirping)
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:31.440]   [ Silence ]
