[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.040]   Happy New Year and welcome to another episode
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.580]   of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.820]   money, and travel.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.760]   I'm Chris Hutchins and I'm excited you're here
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.280]   for the first episode of 2023.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   I also hope you're feeling better than I am
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.320]   because somehow everyone in our house
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.700]   has gotten a cold or flu twice
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.460]   in the past two and a half weeks.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.800]   But sick or not, I am excited to kick off the new year
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.060]   with another listener question episode.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.740]   We're gonna cover paying down your mortgage,
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.400]   where to put cash savings,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.320]   managing credit cards with your partner,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.040]   booking hotels direct versus the portal,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.000]   what to do when you're short on points,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.920]   how to save money on data while traveling, and more.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.900]   I'm also gonna share some of the listener hacks
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.160]   that you all sent me.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.960]   So let's get right into it after this.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.520]   Okay, to get started,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   I just wanna share a few amazing listener wins
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.760]   that you guys have sent in.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.840]   It makes me so happy to hear these stories,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.440]   so keep them coming.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.760]   First, I wanna talk about Chad's story.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.000]   He and his wife hadn't opened a card in over 15 years
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.440]   before listening to the show,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.200]   and they've now amassed almost 400,000 points.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   And use some of those points for five nights in Ontario,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.880]   a free Marriott stay,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.400]   flights for the whole family to Florida.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.760]   And Chad's estimate is that they've not only saved $2,000
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.960]   in travel already,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   but they still have 300,000 points to use.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.380]   He also said that as part of this,
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.600]   he and his wife's credit scores
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.080]   have both jumped 20 to 40 points.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.360]   That is awesome, Chad.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.200]   I love hearing that story.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.120]   Similarly, Prema was able to rack up 100,000 points
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.920]   from a signup bonus and used it to fly her little sister
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.320]   to the States from India for 45,000 miles,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   which saved her almost $1,200.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.240]   She said she got this taste of points and miles,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.360]   and now she wants more.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.960]   So I hope 2023 brings you even more points.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.480]   After talking about unclaimed money,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.280]   I got a message from a listener who looked and found $93,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.520]   which was cool,
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.480]   but he got obsessed and started checking out
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   all of his friends and family
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.640]   and ended up finding over $1,000 for everyone.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.160]   One of his friends actually had $500 owed just to him.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   He'd never even heard of it before and is so excited.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   If you're listening to this
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.320]   and haven't already checked for unclaimed money yourself,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.920]   search for unclaimed money and the name of your state
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.320]   and go to that site and see what you're owed.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.240]   I got another email from Amy,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.960]   who said she emailed a hotel,
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   just like we've talked about on the show a lot,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.480]   and told them she was excited for her upcoming stay.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.600]   And when they arrived, she got upgraded to a corner suite.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.560]   They had a cool present for her kid
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.360]   and a fancy box of chocolates for the adults.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.320]   And they comped their parking, which was $70 a day.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040]   So if you're listening and you're not booking hotels direct
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.080]   and sending a note, you definitely should,
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.120]   because you never know if you're gonna get hooked up
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   like Amy did.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.600]   And finally, Michael heard my story on the London episode
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.520]   about saving money on Airbnbs.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   And so he messaged the host of a property
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   that was a little out of his price range
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   and was able to get 15% off and booked it immediately.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.480]   And he said that since this is all the hacks,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.120]   he went and bought a $500 Airbnb gift card on Amazon
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.520]   with his Chase Amazon card to get 5% cash back
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.880]   before booking the rest on his Sapphire Reserve
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.760]   for three X points.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.160]   Awesome job, Michael.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.120]   I hope everyone that's booking Airbnbs
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.680]   is doing their best to negotiate a better deal.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.440]   So those are just a few of the wins
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   I've gotten from you all.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.440]   Please send them in.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.800]   I love hearing stories like that.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.560]   But I also wanna share some of the great deals
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.880]   and hacks that you guys have sent in as well.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.080]   So first off, Skylar wrote in and listened
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.040]   to a few episodes where I've said that really
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.600]   some of the only great deals for points on hotels is Hyatt.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.840]   And he wanted to point out that that's not always the case.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.120]   If you have Citi or Capital One points,
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.320]   he's been able to transfer them to Wyndham
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.880]   and get a really good deal using them
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   with the Vacasa program.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.800]   And when I say good deal,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.760]   he's been getting two to four cents per point,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.400]   including a nice place he just booked
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.560]   for a winter weekend in Tahoe.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.040]   He also said there's some good deals
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.280]   transferring from Citi to Choice
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.120]   when you get a one to two ratio,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.160]   and especially when you're traveling in Scandinavia,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.360]   or if you're using the points
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   to book their preferred resorts and hotels,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920]   though he's never done the latter
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.440]   because as good of a deal as it is,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   it can kind of be a headache to book.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   So if you're thinking about how you could use your points
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.480]   for hotels, definitely consider checking out
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   the Wyndham Vacasa program or some of the Choice hotels
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.040]   and see if you can get as a good deal as Skyler.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.800]   Thank you so much for sending that in.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.480]   Also, Manny sent in a great hack
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.920]   for transportation to the airport
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.600]   on your last day in the city.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.200]   It turns out that sometimes it's actually cheaper
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.280]   to do a one-way car rental from the city to the airport
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.060]   than it is to pay for a Lyft or Uber to get there.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.000]   But if you have a late flight and an early checkout,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.760]   it can actually be even better
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.200]   because you can rent a car in the morning,
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.720]   go and tour the city, go stop off, go see interesting stuff,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.360]   and then drop it off at the airport
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.680]   and not have to pay to shuttle yourself around,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.400]   have a place to store your bags,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.480]   and it makes everything easier and you can save money.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   That's an awesome suggestion.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.520]   I hope some people can get some good value there.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.280]   Finally, Nirav wanted to recommend
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.120]   that people check out
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.640]   the Cashback Comparison browser extension
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.480]   because it compares the cashback rates
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.400]   from all kinds of sites like Rakuten and Top Cashback.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.120]   I know in the past I've suggested Cashback Monitor,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.840]   but just having something on the browser
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.960]   saves you even more time,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.800]   so Nirav, thanks for that suggestion.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.760]   All right, those are some great hacks.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.720]   I really hope you guys keep sending them in
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.160]   and I'll keep sharing them
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.640]   because I know everyone listening
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.600]   loves hearing new ways to save.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.160]   So let's jump into questions.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.680]   First, I wanna tackle two questions
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.280]   that are very similar from Gavin and Matt.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.800]   Both of them had a rough question
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.640]   about paying down your mortgage
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.040]   to reduce your monthly payments.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.180]   One of the questions was about
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.080]   whether it makes sense to pay it down
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.400]   or to invest that money
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.720]   and take the growth and income from those investments
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.280]   to make your mortgage payments.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.800]   And the other was about whether it makes sense
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.920]   to withdraw money from a retirement account
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.840]   like a Roth IRA or a brokerage account
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   to pay down your mortgage
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.680]   so you can lower your monthly payments.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.420]   So I know I've talked about this in the past,
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.160]   but mortgage rates were 2% or 3% back then,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.840]   so I think it's worth bringing this up again
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.580]   now that mortgage rates are in the high single digits.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.360]   However, I wanna point out a few things.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.840]   So one, mortgage interest in the US
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.640]   for a mortgage up to $750,000,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.920]   if you itemize on your taxes, is tax deductible.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.480]   So even if you're paying 7%,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.160]   if you itemize your taxes,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.800]   that 7% is probably reduced
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.760]   by anywhere from a third to half,
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.120]   depending on what state you're in
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.720]   and what your tax bracket's in.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   So if you look at the average long-term return
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.120]   of a portfolio, anywhere from the 5% to 8%,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.160]   I'm guessing that after your tax deductibility
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.360]   of your mortgage interest,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.280]   you're at about break-even.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.000]   However, there's one important thing to consider,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.140]   and that's that your mortgage can be refinanced.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.240]   So just because your mortgage today is at 5% or 8%
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.760]   doesn't mean that interest rates might not drop
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.040]   and you might be able to refinance
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.520]   at 3% or 4% in a few years.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.200]   So for me, even at high interest rates today,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.560]   I still don't like the option of paying down your mortgage,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.620]   especially if it means taking money
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.520]   out of a tax-advantaged account,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.080]   and even more so if it means paying penalties or fees.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.320]   All that said, this is much more of an emotional
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.520]   than a rational decision,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.060]   and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.200]   There are a lot of people out there
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.520]   that I know are so stressed out every day and week
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.920]   just thinking about the fact that they have debt,
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.400]   and knowing that they could live in their home
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.640]   with no mortgage payment in the future
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.880]   is something that could bring them
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.640]   such satisfaction and emotional comfort
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.880]   that even if it's not the perfect optimal thing to do,
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.680]   it might still be the right thing for them to do.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.440]   So like I said, there's no perfect answer,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.320]   but in general, if you can deduct the interest
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.840]   on your mortgage, I think at rates today,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.720]   I would still rather put the money in the market
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.200]   for the long-term and make my regular mortgage payments,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.000]   and if and when rates go down,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.960]   refinance to lock in a lower rate.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.140]   Next, I got a question from Chelsea
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.040]   about where to put money that they're saving
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.400]   for a big trip to Europe in three years.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.880]   She asked whether it makes sense to put it in savings,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.520]   in index funds, in the market, or what makes sense,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.480]   because she doesn't wanna be too risky,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.480]   but she also doesn't want it to just sit and not grow.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.600]   A few years ago, this might have been a harder question
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.880]   because the interest rates were so low on savings accounts
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.040]   that it really made it tough to leave your money in cash
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.940]   earning 0.1 or 0.2%, but my general rule of thumb
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.840]   has been that for anything you need in the next five years,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   don't put it in the market, and the reason is simple.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.840]   The stock market is volatile enough
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   that at any given point in time,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.360]   you could see your portfolio,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.320]   depending on how risky your portfolio is,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.360]   down 10, 20, 30%, and in years past,
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.800]   those things have lasted multiple years.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.080]   If you look at the market right now,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   for at least a year, your portfolio's probably been down,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.360]   and if this is money that you need
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   in a specific period of time that's less than five years,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.360]   you don't wanna be in a situation
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.240]   where the market's down and you don't have
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.120]   the money you need, and this goes for a down payment
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.240]   in a few years, a trip, any kind of major purchase
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.600]   or investment, or maybe you wanna quit your job
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.640]   to start a company or do something on your own
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.600]   or take a year off, so my advice here
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.500]   is to keep the money in cash, and fortunately, right now,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.520]   there are a lot of great options
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.400]   for where you can put money in cash and earn high yield.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.280]   If you already have all the money you need right now,
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.240]   then a great option might be to use
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.280]   one of the brokered CD options from Schwab,
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.160]   Vanguard, or Fidelity, which currently are up to 4.9%
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.440]   for durations of anywhere from 10 to 24 months.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.720]   However, you have to actually have the money now,
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.520]   so if this is a trip that you wanna take
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.640]   and you're gonna be saving for it over the next three years,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.280]   then a CD might not be the best option
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.160]   'cause you don't have the money now,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.040]   and instead, I would open up a cash account
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.760]   where you can earn high yield on your cash
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.600]   while everything is FDIC-insured
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.720]   and you're not taking any risk in the market.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.260]   For me, I have mine at Wealthfront where I'm getting 3.8%.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.160]   I know that there are some options out there
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.800]   that are at 4%, 4.05, 4.1,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.480]   but one of the things I learned at Wealthfront,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.680]   and we actually wrote a blog post about this,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.200]   is that if you're always chasing the best rates
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.640]   and moving your money between different accounts,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.280]   you actually lose out a lot by having your money in transit
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   because you're not earning interest when it's in transit.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.360]   So let's pretend that you decide
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   you always wanna get the best rate,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.320]   and once a quarter, you're gonna transfer your money
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.000]   from one bank to the next bank,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   and those ACH transfers take a week each time.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.760]   So you're gonna miss out on four weeks of interest
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.080]   over the course of the year,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.000]   which is about 7.5% of the year.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.920]   So if you're saying that the average rate
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.720]   for a super-optimized account is 4.1%
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.360]   and you miss out on 7.5% of the year,
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.200]   you're effectively gonna earn 3.79% for the year anyways.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.400]   So for me, I have watched how Wealthfront operates.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.120]   I've seen the rates they've had.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.840]   They're always consistently raising when the Fed raises.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.520]   So for me, it's just easier to keep it in one place
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.360]   that I'm confident will go up as rates rise.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.520]   There are other banks and institutions you could check out
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.040]   that might do the same thing,
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.520]   but I'll link to the show notes,
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.360]   the article about rate chasing.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   But I just don't think it's always the best
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.400]   to go pick a random bank that has a high APY right now,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.480]   because if you're constantly having to move around,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   you actually lose out more in the long run.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.720]   So in general, for short-term savings less than five years,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.260]   especially right now with high interest rates,
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.120]   I would go high-yield cash or high-yield savings
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.240]   for anything that I'm contributing to regularly.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.880]   And if it's money that I've already saved
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   and I just wanna hold onto it,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.280]   I'd be looking at some of these brokered CDs
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.960]   that are a little bit higher yield,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.480]   but you have to lock your money up
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.760]   for anywhere from 10 to 24 months.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   Most New Year's resolutions involve long-term habits,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.640]   but they're quickly forgotten after a week or two.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.560]   But with Fabric by Gerber Life,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.000]   you can resolve to finally get life insurance
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.720]   and you don't even have to do it again next year.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.280]   Fabric is the quick and easy way
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.720]   to help protect your family

[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.720]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.300]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents

[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.560]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy

[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.100]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.480]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.040]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.080]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.080]   for less than a dollar a day.

[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   M-E-E-T fabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.080]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company,
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.800]   not available in certain states,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.500]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.400]   Our next partner has a product I literally use every day.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.880]   I started taking AG-1 from Athletic Greens
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.380]   because I wanted an easy way
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.320]   to get my daily nutritional insurance
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.240]   and optimize my immune system.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.760]   And it's been in my routine for almost a year,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.080]   because when you take one scoop of AG-1,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.560]   whole food source superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.240]   to help you start your day right.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.760]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.880]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.960]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.480]   and energized for the day,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.000]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.760]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.460]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.240]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.320]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.080]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.660]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.520]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.840]   to take ownership over your health
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.440]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.000]   Okay, so I wanna move on to some travel and points stuff.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.440]   And Scott wrote in saying he's getting married next year,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.920]   so congrats, and he's wondering what he should do
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.260]   to get the most out of points with his partner.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.680]   He asked if he should add her to his platinum card,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.800]   or if he should refer her to get her own.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.880]   And this becomes an interesting question,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.760]   so I'll talk a little bit about how we do it.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.800]   In general, there's two ways to approach this,
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.400]   and you can kind of combine them.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.080]   One is around sign-up bonuses.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.720]   And if there's a card with a really big sign-up bonus,
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.320]   then for us, we try to get it twice
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.840]   so we can maximize the points that we can earn.
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.680]   But when it comes to keeping the card over the long-term,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.320]   we try not to have two of the same card,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.600]   unless for some reason, the rare case that there's a card
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.040]   where the perks and credits and benefits of that card
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.200]   far outweigh the annual fee,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.600]   and it actually makes sense to have two of them.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.200]   That's usually not the case.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.400]   So in general, we try to make sure
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.940]   that we just have each card once.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.480]   But if there's a huge sign-up bonus,
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.260]   we might both open it to get the bonus.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.240]   Now, with Chase, Citi, and Capital One,
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.800]   it's really easy to transfer your points
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.240]   between your partner.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.640]   So if you both were to open up a Capital One card,
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.840]   and let's take the Venture or the Venture X card
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.160]   and get 75,000 points right now,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.640]   you could actually transfer those 75
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   plus whatever points you earn on the card
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   as you meet the minimum spend into one account,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.040]   and then either keep that card open or downgrade it.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.560]   Obviously, I would always recommend
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.080]   waiting till the end of the year
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.280]   to talk about downgrading and canceling.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.760]   You don't want any of the card issuers to look at you
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.560]   and say, oh, you're the person that opened the card,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.600]   got the bonus, and shut it down right away.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.240]   So reminder, you can go back to listen
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.160]   to some old Q&A episodes where I've talked exactly
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.800]   about how I think about when to close cards.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   But in general, if you open up the same two cards
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.440]   to get the bonus, there's no point
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.560]   in keeping both of them active unless the rare case
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.880]   that the annual fee is lower
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.720]   than the value you get from the card.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.040]   I think the big exception to this
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.120]   is if you're in the military
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.880]   and all of your annual fees are waived,
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.120]   then by all means, having both cards for both spouses
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.720]   might make a lot of sense because you're able
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.040]   to take all the perks and all the benefits
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.600]   without paying the annual fees.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.520]   I will say that with Amex, there is no way
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.600]   to transfer points to another person.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.760]   So just know that if you and your partner
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.000]   both open up an Amex, unless you use the points,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.720]   you're not gonna be able to combine those points
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.120]   in a one account if you keep only one card open.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.920]   Next, I wanna address a question from Olivia
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.200]   about opening up airline accounts.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.920]   So she asked if she should open up a frequent flyer account
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.280]   for every airline that she can transfer points to
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.440]   from her credit card.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   So before I answer, I wanna draw an important distinction
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.560]   between opening up the accounts
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.620]   and actually moving points into them.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.520]   So I definitely don't think you should move any points
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.680]   out of your Amex, Chase, Cap One, Citi, Balances,
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.620]   to other airlines until you're ready to book.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.980]   But there are a few airlines where you can't transfer points
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.040]   to them unless the account has been active for 24 hours
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.180]   or three days or one week, different rules like that.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.640]   So I would say that maybe it doesn't have to be right away,
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.760]   but as soon as you start thinking about planning a trip,
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.820]   at some point I would go and open up a frequent flyer account
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.140]   for at least the airlines you're considering booking through.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.560]   At a minimum, I think depending on which credit card
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   you have, airlines like Air France, United, British Airways,
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.500]   even maybe Avios are all airlines
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.460]   that I've opened up accounts at even before I needed them
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.260]   just so that I had them ready to go.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.620]   It also helps that when you open up those accounts,
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.140]   you're able to search for flights on their websites.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.660]   Some airlines will let you do without being logged in,
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.560]   but most need you to be logged in.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.700]   So because it's easy, because it doesn't cost anything,
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.260]   I've gone ahead for myself and opened up accounts
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.740]   at most of the major airlines I think I'd use
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.960]   just to have on hand.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.540]   Now Charles asked a similar question,
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.480]   which was whether it makes sense to go open up
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.580]   frequent flyer accounts for all of your children
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.740]   or whether it's not worth it.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.340]   So every time we're flying on a flight
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.820]   that we bought seats on, because you don't earn points
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.860]   when you're booking your flight with miles
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.460]   through the airline, but if you're using your points
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.300]   to book in the portal, you will.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.280]   So if I'm booking in the portal or if I'm paying cash
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.060]   for any seats for a child, not a lap infant,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.220]   but actual seats, I'm gonna go in
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.640]   and I'm gonna create a frequent flyer account for my kids.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.900]   And I know that the miles aren't that big
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.000]   and they're obviously not earning extra bonuses
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.060]   from credit cards and that kind of stuff,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.620]   but I think over the next 15 or 20 years,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.620]   it'll add up to something.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.880]   While it might not be enough right away for a free flight,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.300]   you can at some point add them as an authorized cardholder
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.740]   to your Chase or Amex account,
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.220]   and that'll let you transfer points into their accounts.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.300]   So let's say you need 50,000 United Miles
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.900]   for a round trip ticket that you're taking somewhere
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.300]   and your kid has racked up 5,000.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.740]   Well, now you're only gonna need to transfer 45,000
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.300]   of their account instead of the full 50,000.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.460]   So for me, I've created accounts for our two-year-old.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.620]   I haven't yet created one for our six-month-old
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.820]   because we haven't bought her a seat on a flight.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.500]   It's always been a lap infant.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.180]   But in the future, I will,
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.360]   and hopefully we'll rack up enough points
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.020]   that maybe by the time they get to college,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.020]   they've got a few free flights they can take.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.640]   And I know I mentioned a little bit
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.500]   about booking on the portal versus not.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.580]   So I'm gonna answer a question
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.460]   that I've probably answered before,
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.580]   but Carl, Tontesh, and Jessica all wrote in questions
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.100]   about booking hotels
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.340]   and whether it makes sense to do it in the portal.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.620]   And I think the big confusion here
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.140]   is that many of the cards and travel portals
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.940]   offer huge bonuses for booking hotels
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.020]   and sometimes flights in their portal.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.380]   So you can get as many as 10 points per dollar
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.940]   booking a hotel in different portals
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.620]   depending on the card you have.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.260]   So I wanna clarify when it makes sense and when it doesn't
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.780]   because it can be a little bit confusing.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.780]   So your chances of getting an upgrade
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.740]   if you book in the portal are almost zero.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.980]   Hotels and hotel chains really don't love bookings
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.700]   that come through a lot of these portals.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.220]   And so they're not gonna treat you
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.620]   anywhere nearly as well as they would
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.100]   if you booked directly with the hotel
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.100]   and especially if you created an account
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.840]   in their loyalty program.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.500]   Also, depending on the hotel chain,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.540]   you might not actually earn any points
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.820]   or elite night status when you book through the portal.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.560]   So if those are important to you,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.540]   you don't wanna book in the portal.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.860]   Also, sometimes the rates that you get
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.420]   on a website for a hotel,
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.660]   especially if you're logged in
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.660]   as one of their members might be better.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.060]   So in general, I would say,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.180]   I would never try to book on a portal website
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.900]   to get 10x points if I'm gonna pay a rate that's 20% more.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.100]   Finally, in the portal, you're subject to
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:09.500]   dealing with chase or whatever travel portal you book in
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.060]   when it comes to changing and cancellations,
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.500]   which can be more strict.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.600]   Sometimes dealing directly with the hotel
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.780]   is gonna get you a little bit further
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.660]   if something goes wrong in the last minute
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:20.880]   or you need to make a change.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.340]   And finally, some travel portals do charge a service fee.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.860]   Amex used to do this a lot.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.780]   I can't remember if they still do,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.020]   but obviously keep in mind
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.340]   whether there's a fee to do anything.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.620]   All that said, if the price is the same
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.420]   and you're booking at a hotel
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.980]   where you don't really earn points
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.900]   or you don't care about status and the rate is the same,
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.000]   and you're pretty confident
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.260]   that you're not gonna need to cancel or change it,
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.940]   and you can earn 10 points per dollar
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.260]   booking in the chase portal
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.480]   or earn nothing on the hotel website, I'm all for it.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.700]   So especially if it's boutique hotels
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.940]   or the kinds of hotels where they're not part of Marriott
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.560]   or Hyatt and you're earning points or status,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.540]   those could be good opportunities.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.100]   But again, you're not gonna be able to email the hotel
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.020]   and ask for an upgrade like Amy did
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.520]   at the beginning of this episode.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.020]   So it really depends what's more important to you.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.000]   Is it earning a few more points or is it getting upgraded?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.900]   When I'm traveling for a conference by myself,
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.600]   I don't care if I have a big room.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.220]   I just need a bed to sleep in.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.900]   And so that would be a good example of the kind of stay
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.900]   where I don't really need the upgrade.
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.040]   And if the closest hotel is not part of a chain,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.580]   I might book in the portal to earn 10X points.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.720]   It's much more the exception than the norm.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.580]   On the topic of transfers, Olivia had a follow-up,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.020]   which was if more than one of her credit card programs
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.020]   transfer to the same airline,
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.900]   for example, Bilt and Capital One,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.260]   and actually almost everyone
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.580]   is a transfer partner of Flying Blue,
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.820]   can she transfer 50,000 Bilt points
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.260]   and 50,000 Capital One points
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.380]   to the same Flying Blue account and make it 100,000?
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.300]   And the answer is absolutely,
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.340]   which is actually one of the reasons I love Flying Blue,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.580]   because they are a transfer partner
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.340]   of almost every credit card.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.240]   So if you've earned some Capital One points
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.340]   and some Chase points,
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.740]   and you're trying to figure out how you can book,
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.460]   one option, which I always say is,
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.100]   well, you don't have to book the round trip
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.660]   from any specific program.
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.640]   So if you have points and the best deal
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.220]   is to transfer your Chase points to United,
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.180]   you could transfer to United to book one way
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.600]   and then use your Amex points,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.280]   which don't transfer to United,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.080]   to transfer to another airline to book the return.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.020]   But with Flying Blue,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.380]   because they're a transfer partner
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.340]   of almost every credit card program,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.520]   you can transfer points from all the programs
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.180]   into the same account and be able to book from there.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.140]   So yes, Olivia, you can do that.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.100]   It's something I've done in the past.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.100]   And I think it's a great way to take advantage
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.540]   of having miles across different accounts.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.620]   And it's especially something to consider
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.100]   even if you have like a small balance somewhere.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.140]   So if you have a card
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.980]   where maybe you only have 10,000 Amex points from a card
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.260]   and you're booking something,
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.860]   even though you might have all the points you need
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.500]   in your Chase account to transfer to Flying Blue,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.420]   it might be a good opportunity to transfer out that balance
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.180]   and then top it up with whatever you need
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.380]   from your Chase account
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.760]   so that you can clear out the small balances.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.920]   Because sometimes I've talked to people
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.160]   who have a card open and they've got five, 10, 15,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.620]   20,000 points and they don't know
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.760]   how they're gonna use them,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.140]   but they don't wanna lose them.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.140]   So they keep that account open forever.
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.740]   And when it comes time to book,
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.840]   if they need 50,000 points,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.540]   they always think, "Oh, well I can't use the points
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.680]   "from that card because it's not enough."
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.320]   But for a program like Flying Blue and British Airways
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.500]   and a few other airlines that are transfer partners
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.460]   of a lot of different credit cards,
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.420]   that's a great opportunity to use them.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.540]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.260]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.100]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.700]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.220]   without our consent.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.020]   I found a listing for my dad
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.180]   on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.300]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.980]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.060]   And that was just one of the 69 listings
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.540]   that had his info.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.700]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.500]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.660]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.900]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete Me from Avine
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.860]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.180]   with them for this episode.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.960]   Delete Me is an amazing service
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.740]   that will not just find and remove
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.620]   your personal information from over 500
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.700]   data broker websites, but they'll continuously scan
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.820]   for new data that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.780]   On average, Delete Me finds and removes
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.140]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.360]   in their first two years, and to date,
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.520]   they've removed over 35 million pieces of data
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.460]   for their customers.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.520]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.020]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.060]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.580]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.540]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.420]   I don't know about you, but I'm using the new year
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.220]   as an excuse to get fitness back in my routine,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.380]   and if you're gonna work out,
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.740]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.980]   which I think is Viore, and I'm excited
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.160]   to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.580]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.580]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.960]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.660]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.520]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.500]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.940]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.420]   And it's not just for men.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.960]   My wife Amy is just as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.900]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.560]   I have a few pairs, and they're probably
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.020]   the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.180]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.200]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.560]   and they can be used for just about any activity,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.860]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.340]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.180]   or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.260]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.580]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.180]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.340]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.080]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.360]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.060]   Now, sometimes you're actually short on miles,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.520]   and Candy wrote in asking what to do
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.500]   because she wants to plan a trip to Spain in April,
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   and she's 10,000 points shy of the round-trip fare for two.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.220]   She knows she'll have the points by the time she goes,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.900]   but she doesn't have them now,
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.100]   and she doesn't wanna necessarily wait.
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.620]   So what is the workaround?
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.620]   Now, I don't know what airlines we're talking about
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.920]   or how many points she needs in total,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.700]   but there are a few options depending on those things.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.860]   So one is you could just buy the points.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.460]   So let's say her trip is gonna be 150,000 points
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.140]   and she's 10,000 shy.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.880]   She could go and buy the extra 10,000 points
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.660]   on whatever airline it is.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.740]   Now, that's not always gonna be the best deal.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.460]   On United, for example, buying 10,000 miles
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.180]   would cost you $350 plus tax,
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.900]   but if that entire trip is going to be the kind of trip
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.500]   where you're gonna save two, three, four, five,
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.620]   or maybe it's in business class
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.020]   and you're gonna save 10 or $20,000,
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.420]   well, maybe the $350 to make it happen now
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.180]   without having to wait is worth it.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.780]   Another option is if you can find someone
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.300]   that can let you borrow the points.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.100]   Now, transferring points to people can sometimes cost money,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.920]   usually never as much as buying the points directly,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.940]   but can also sometimes be free.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.260]   So if you need an extra 10,000 Capital One points,
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.020]   you can actually transfer Capital One points
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.460]   from any cardholder to any other cardholder,
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.340]   whether they're related or not.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.140]   So if you're shy 10,000 Capital One points
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.740]   and you know someone that has them,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.980]   you might be able to do that.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.500]   To keep to the United example,
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.220]   transferring 10,000 miles to another person
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.380]   costs 150 instead of 350 to buy them,
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.960]   so that might be a better deal.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.180]   So one option that might not work for everyone,
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.980]   but if you had the cashflow to be able to pre-buy things,
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.300]   so let's say you need an extra 10,000 points
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.260]   and you have an Amex Gold card,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.900]   could you go to the grocery store
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.160]   and buy five $500 gift cards
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.920]   for retailers that you use regularly,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.880]   whether it's Amazon, gas, groceries,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.580]   anything that you know you're gonna spend.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.900]   I'm not recommending you buy gift cards that you don't need,
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.760]   but if you're able to buy five $500 gift cards,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.760]   that's $2,500, you're getting four X points
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.440]   at the grocery store so you'd earn 10,000 points.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.040]   Similarly, for example, if you had a card
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.000]   like the Capital One Venture X card
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.120]   and you were to put a payment to the IRS on,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.280]   the fee that they often charge is a little under 2%,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.240]   so for $10,000, you'd be paying a fee of about $200
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.160]   to be able to put that purchase on your card
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   and you would earn those 10,000 points.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   So it really depends on which card
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.480]   and which way you wanna generate points,
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.640]   but those are a few of the options that you have right now.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.880]   Last one on the points side is,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.440]   I got an email from Sandra asking
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.640]   if I could review the PNC Points card
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.320]   and she was excited because it said
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.720]   it gives four points per dollar,
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.400]   which seems higher than every card,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.140]   and wanted to know what I thought.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.000]   Well, I'll give the award to the PNC Points card
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.100]   for the most deceptive marketing
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.900]   because they say four points per dollar, which is great.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.140]   In the average card, four points per dollar
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.720]   is an awesome return.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.440]   However, when you look at the value of those points,
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.380]   they're anywhere from 0.1 to 0.3 cents per point,
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.000]   which on average, you're getting
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.120]   about 0.25 cents per point.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.300]   So you're earning four points per dollar,
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.040]   but those points are worth 25 cents,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.240]   so you're earning about an average of 1% return.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.560]   They do have some bonuses,
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.000]   depending on what kind of PNC account you have
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.400]   and how much money's in it,
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.920]   but at a maximum, you're gonna be earning
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.880]   effectively 1.75% back.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.880]   So for me, I'd much rather, at a minimum,
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.260]   use a 2% cash back card like the Citi Double Cash,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.080]   or more realistically, I'd rather earn points,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.520]   and a card like the Venture or the Venture X card
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.880]   is gonna earn you 2X points on everything,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.680]   which means that at a minimum,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.800]   it's effectively a 2% cash back card,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.960]   so better than the PNC Points card.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.520]   But if you look at, for example,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.660]   the Points guy values Capital One points at 1.85 cents.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.540]   So if you're getting two points at 1.85 cents,
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.560]   you're effectively getting 3.7% cash back.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.240]   So I'm a much bigger fan of almost every other card
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.600]   than this card, so don't fall prey to their marketing
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.580]   making you think you're getting
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.360]   four valuable points per dollar,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.580]   because unfortunately, you are not.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.720]   And I've said this before, but I'll say it again,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.240]   because I really appreciate all the support you guys give.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   If you're signing up for new cards
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.200]   and wanna support the show and me,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.580]   go to allthehacks.com/cards and sign up for your card there.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.340]   It really helps us out.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.320]   That said, if you find a better bonus
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.780]   or your friend can refer you and you can get a better deal,
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.960]   I want you to have the most points possible,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.860]   so do that instead, but if all deals are the same,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.000]   allthehacks.com/cards would be greatly appreciated.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.120]   Now, moving on to a couple travel questions
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.400]   before we wrap up.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:33.480]   The biggest one was from Diane and Drew,
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.040]   both trying to figure out how they can save money
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.420]   while they're traveling on data.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.440]   So I'll give you guys a few options that I think are great.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.920]   So one, there are a few carriers in the US,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.880]   Google Fi and T-Mobile being the primary two,
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.040]   that actually include free international data.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.000]   So I believe Google Fi's data internationally
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   is a little bit faster.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.760]   I have a T-Mobile plan,
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.640]   and while the data's free internationally,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.200]   it's a little bit slow, but keep in mind,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.260]   I don't have a fancy T-Mobile plan.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.240]   It's like a $20 a month, two gigabyte plan.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.560]   I think if you have a fancier, unlimited plan,
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.680]   you'll probably get higher speed data while traveling.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.840]   So that's one option,
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.040]   but not everyone wants to switch their carrier.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.000]   One of the things we do is we're on a Verizon family plan,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.800]   and we're on the 5G Do More plan.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.400]   And the thing I love about that plan
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.380]   is that every month, you get one free travel pass day
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.800]   on your Verizon account.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.360]   You can accrue up to 12.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.520]   At 12, it caps off, but when we recently went to London,
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.560]   we each had accrued 12, and so fortunately,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.520]   when we were in Paris and London for exactly 12 days,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.560]   we just used our 12 travel pass days,
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.000]   so we were able to use our phones,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   we were able to do high speed data,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and we didn't have to pay for anything.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.480]   Now, if you're gonna be traveling more than 12 days a year,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.860]   it's not a great option
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.720]   because you'll run out of travel pass days.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.560]   So on a trip to Europe last year,
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.400]   we actually searched on Amazon,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.680]   and there's an orange SIM card you can buy
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.360]   that includes, I think it was 10 gigabytes of data
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.840]   and some texts and some phone calls for $38
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.720]   and worked all over Europe.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.000]   And right now, I'm looking,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.240]   and it looks like it actually includes 20 gigabytes
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.880]   right now, so you can get 20 gigs for $40.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   So that's one option that I think was great.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.040]   The other is to use an eSIM.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.840]   And I know that Diana actually tried this
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.160]   and had some struggles, so I reached out and asked people
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.760]   where the best eSIM store was.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.960]   And shout out to Paul Stamatow, a friend of mine,
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.120]   @stami on Twitter, who shared
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.080]   that the Arilow eSIM store was fantastic.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.760]   So in his case, he actually got a 10 gig eSIM for Europe
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.560]   for only $16, and it worked great.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.640]   So I'll put a link to that in the show notes,
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.400]   but the way it works is you used to have to buy a SIM card
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.720]   and actually physically put it in your phone.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.780]   And the orange SIMs I mentioned for Europe
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.480]   that you can buy on Amazon are that.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.760]   It's a physical SIM card you have to put in.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.240]   But with eSIMs, for a phone that supports it,
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.680]   you can actually add the SIM card to your phone
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.320]   without having to put anything in it.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   So at any of these websites,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.040]   you can actually sign up for a new carrier
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.680]   and get an eSIM and add it to your account
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.720]   and actually run it simultaneously
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.580]   alongside your main carrier.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.000]   In fact, one thing I did just to give me the most option
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.880]   was I actually transferred my Verizon account
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.440]   from a physical SIM card to an eSIM.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.200]   And I did this actually last year
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.080]   because I bought this SIM card
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.840]   for going to Europe on Amazon.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.420]   I wanted to be able to put it in my phone,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.840]   but still have my Verizon account active,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.160]   even though I'd turned data roaming off.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.500]   So I definitely recommend if you want the most flexibility
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.200]   to transfer your domestic carrier
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.400]   onto your phone as an eSIM
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.200]   so you can free up the SIM card spot
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.660]   just in case you need it while you're traveling.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.560]   But now that it's so easy to get eSIMs around the world,
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.160]   especially at a marketplace like AeroLow,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.520]   that would be my option.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.720]   And that's probably what we'll do going forward
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.680]   if we're traveling any more
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.280]   than the 12 days we get for free each year with Verizon.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.280]   Finally, I wanna talk about storing photos
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.700]   because Jordan asked what I do
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.880]   to organize, store, and manage your photos.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.760]   And frankly, I'll share what I do,
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.660]   but I would also love anyone who has a better suggestion
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.140]   because there are a few problems with the solution we have.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.880]   So our current option, and we all have iPhones,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.800]   is that we just have the two terabyte iCloud plan
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.580]   and we take all our photos,
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.520]   we store them all on our phone, and that's it.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.040]   It's super straightforward.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.440]   Before that, I used Flickr
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.280]   and it was just a lot of hassle to manage
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.860]   because you have to get all your photos up there,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.120]   you have to upload them.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.160]   I felt like some of the data was getting lost,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.280]   whether it was live photos or videos or the location data.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.360]   I haven't really tried Google Photos for a long time,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.040]   so maybe this is the answer.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.800]   But let me explain the biggest benefits and problems
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.760]   with the iCloud option.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.600]   So the greatest thing
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.360]   is that everything's just super seamless.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.380]   I take all my photos, it's great.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.780]   We actually travel sometimes with a physical camera,
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.140]   I throw the SD card in,
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.340]   I import them to Apple Photos on my Mac,
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.640]   and all the photos show up there as well.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.140]   It's super simple.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.960]   The one thing that's really frustrating,
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.340]   and I don't think I have a great solution,
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.260]   is that Amy, my wife, is always asking for my photos.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.700]   And I wish there was some way
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.380]   that I could just give her access to the entire library
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.980]   so that I don't have to create a shared album every time
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.140]   and upload all the photos,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.620]   and I don't think there's any easy way to do that.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.440]   So that is my one gripe.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.900]   If there were a solution that made that easier,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.340]   I would absolutely switch,
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.540]   because just recently we went to London and Paris,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.280]   and Amy's asking me, "Where are all the photos?"
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.560]   And it seems so silly to create a shared album
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.020]   and transfer basically hundreds of photos
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.660]   into that shared album,
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.340]   but I don't think it necessarily uses extra space,
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.100]   so maybe that's just the answer.
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.600]   But it's the best thing we've found so far,
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.040]   and it's what we're doing.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.660]   Okay, I know there are a few other questions.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.820]   If you emailed in and I haven't gotten to them,
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.900]   I will try to get to them in the future.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.600]   If it's been more than a few months, please reach back out.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.820]   I might have lost the email, I might have forgot,
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.740]   but I really do try hard to respond
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.260]   to every single one of the questions you guys write in.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.940]   Finally, before we wrap,
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.340]   if anyone has a Chase Freedom card,
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.100]   don't forget that it's Q1,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.780]   and you can go activate 5X points.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.220]   This quarter, it's grocery stores, fitness clubs,
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.020]   gym memberships, and Target,
