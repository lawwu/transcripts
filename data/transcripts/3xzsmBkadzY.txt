[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980]   Thank you.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:59.960]   Thank you.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:29.940]   Thank you.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:59.920]   Thank you.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:29.900]   Thank you.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:59.880]   Thank you.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:29.860]   Thank you.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:59.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:29.820]   Thank you.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:59.800]   Thank you.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:29.780]   Thank you.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:59.760]   Thank you.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.180]   Hello, shipping.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.360]   It's a good time to go ahead and take your seat.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.160]   And then for those of you guys who, you know, like to be on your computers, taking notes
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.100]   on a digital document, I apologize.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.380]   I made the document kind of late because I forgot about it.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.700]   I finished the PowerPoint, it's a good day, but it's a good day, but it's a good point, but
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.900]   it's made and then it got emailed out.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.760]   So if you're the type to bust out your laptops and do that, please know you can do that, okay?
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:42.320]   Well, today we're talking about the wise foundational element of character trait of the parent, okay?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.560]   It's strange to say, yeah, I mean, it's a good thing.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.900]   It's strange to say, you know, it's a good thing, but it's a good thing.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.240]   And maybe there's a good thing about it.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.520]   But what we did is actually talk about, like, just conceptually the large whole.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:01.260]   Then we talked about perspectives and just kind of a more like, you know, our view of the children, ourselves, etc.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.840]   And then we're going to talk about how our character translates into our parenting.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.420]   So let's pray, ask for the Lord's blessing during this time of meditating on the various principles.
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.260]   Lord, we thank you.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:26.140]   Thank you, God, that this path of love, this path of instruction, this path of granting revelation of your truth,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:33.680]   Lord, obviously, God, you instituted it, you modeled it, and it flows from your character.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.500]   So, Lord, we take this time to just thank you that in your perfect character as Father,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.320]   you continue to wish for us that which belongs to you.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.040]   You command us to be holy because you are.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.560]   You command us to be loving because you are.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.620]   And everything else, Lord, we do comes and flows from everything that you are.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.460]   So tonight, God, we just want to thank you and again ask that as we think about these important topics,
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.820]   grant to us understanding, but definitely, Lord, grant to us wisdom
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:12.220]   because the application of it is sometimes difficult, and we require the strength that you provide.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.380]   So we thank you.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.140]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.760]   Amen.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:24.500]   Okay, so I want to do a quick way of review, okay, that last week we were talking about wise parenting perspectives.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:31.140]   And generically, I said, hey, the children are blessings who are filled with the curse of wickedness
[00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.420]   and embedded into their heart.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:40.160]   But the big, big picture is that by the design of God, you are the authority figure leading their lives, okay?
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:48.360]   And within this picture, I gave the encouragement and challenge, you are convinced of that perspective,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.520]   and then you give that perspective to your child that even when you go to discipline them, you explain,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.260]   I'm not just spanking you, I'm not just mad at you, and I'm not just irritated,
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.280]   but your obedience to me is your protection.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.480]   This is the way God has designed it.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.920]   If you go outside of my command, you're leaving my protection.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.460]   I say that to my children all the time in their younger ages, up until they were, you know, like 10, 11, 12 years old,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:22.040]   I told them, like, everything that's happening underneath my commands, instructions,
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.780]   is truly God's design for your safety.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.820]   Do you believe it?
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.360]   Okay?
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.320]   Now, the next thing I said last time was, so you have to understand that that's the general perspective
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.240]   of our expectation of their obedience to us, but as we look at the child, we recognize that,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.060]   yes, there's so many things operating, but what we need to really understand
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.460]   is that the foundation of where all of their emotions, words, and behavior comes
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.040]   is from the wealth of their heart, because that's what Jesus told us, right?
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.900]   From the contents of your heart, you either speak all of these heinous things,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.280]   or from the wealth of your heart, good things flow.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.780]   Now, in thinking about this, then, I wanted to just add to that a little bit and say,
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.880]   we have to think about, then, our perspective.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.840]   This is all review of perspectives.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.180]   When you look at your child's behavior, how are you seeing it?
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:26.280]   Are you seeing it as such, beliefs, heart desires, bearing its fruit?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:35.860]   Or is there any subtle way in which we have been convinced by our modern-day idioms, ideologies,
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.380]   and psychology theories to paint how we see our own children?
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.720]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.560]   This is where biblical counseling and modern-day psychology will have its big rift.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.000]   This is not a biblical counseling seminar, so I'm going to make this really fast.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.260]   One, you see your child's behavior as moral content of their faith, period.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.220]   Or you see it as norms of their physical development.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.640]   This is nothing, not necessarily spiritual or moral, but it's just neurological.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.580]   Or it's environmental, symptomatic of what's happening to them.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.640]   That's your big divide.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.920]   How that plays out, you don't have to memorize this, because, again, you're not taking a psychology
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   versus biblical counseling course, but how does it play out is that things you would morally
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.200]   call disobedience and rebellion, okay?
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.540]   The DSM-5, it has as it's officially recognized, and therefore, our current government, the NIH,
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:41.000]   and its health department, et cetera, accepts these as how we categorize student or child behavior.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.560]   If a child is disobedient, they may have oppositional defiant disorder, which I think is pretty comedic
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.500]   if you take a moment to think about that, right?
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.340]   One of the ones I want to highlight to you, because I can't go over everything, is there's
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:02.720]   one right in the middle called antisocial personality disorder, which, again, it sounds a little
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.260]   funny, but it has become really popular in current psychology.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.000]   Why?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.300]   Because it's almost a catch-all.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.860]   What do I mean, catch-all?
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:18.220]   Within the antisocial personality disorder, the DSM-5 says, if they have a failure to conform
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.960]   to the social norms or expectations of parents, if they have a hard time following rules, if
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.020]   they're deceitful, if they have repeat lies, if they're irritable, if they're impulsive, if
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.080]   they show aggressiveness, if they're reckless, it's like the biggest catch-all, and then you
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.520]   categorize that as a disorder.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.500]   So what is that?
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.520]   And why do I say this?
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:48.340]   Your perspective is very important, because you, the parent, you have to discern wisely
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.220]   and judge the behavior of your children.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.420]   Is this sin?
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.100]   Is this moral?
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.400]   Is this rebellion?
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.020]   Is it lies?
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:04.520]   Going back to this chart here, this little simple table, you have to be the one to reveal
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.540]   to them this, when you exaggerated what your brother did to you, you understand you lied
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.620]   to me, was that telling the truth?
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.740]   You have to expose that, right?
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:21.180]   If your child does something where they're trading Pokemon cards and then they decided to trade
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.920]   some fake ones, they knew it was fake.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.960]   You got to look at your child and say, that was absolutely immoral because that's stealing
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.980]   in God's eyes.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.800]   Were you up front?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.460]   Were you upright?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.600]   You have to be the one to reveal all that, right?
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.940]   Therefore, this is where it's super hard for parents.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:44.920]   That requires you and me to be ready in character, to be willing to call out the sin within the
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.320]   children in our own homes.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:46.800]   Yes?
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.320]   Why am I talking about this?
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.460]   Because it points to this fact.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.460]   Parents have moments of decision all the time.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:04.000]   What do you accept as normative for this age child versus what do you expect them to rise
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.400]   to because this is God's design?
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.060]   So, I want to take a moment to clarify something.
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:15.640]   The previous week, I said, do not be afraid to expect things of your child they cannot do.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.380]   Please don't take that.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:24.000]   A lot of my words, again, in speaking about parenting, I'll speak in principle, and maybe
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.380]   it sounds like the law.
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.600]   It's just more guiding principles, right?
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.300]   But for sure, I don't mean like, expect your kid to study five hours straight, you know?
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.860]   Because they're going to be amazing.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.240]   You don't know I'm not talking about that.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:44.660]   What I'm saying is, can you say to the young child, God expects you to give more than you
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.500]   receive, to prefer your brother and love sacrificially?
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.240]   The answer is yes.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.700]   Don't be afraid to reveal God's high standard.
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.380]   Don't be afraid to do that, right?
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:03.200]   But here and now, I want to just take a moment to say, our perspectives matter a lot because
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.560]   what ends up happening is, there's opportunities and instances that constantly come in and out
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.820]   of our every single day.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:18.200]   How much of my child's behavior am I, as the responsible parent, going to sit back and allow,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.480]   accept as normative?
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:25.780]   And how much do I actually sit and say, no, that is defiance against God?
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.240]   That is lying to your brother.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.940]   That is this and this, and you're repeatedly correcting the behavior and the speech of your
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.260]   child.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.220]   And it's a lot.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.060]   It's a lot like church.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:47.820]   In some degree, we have to admit, leaders of the church have, in some sense, very little
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.560]   authority or control over what's happening.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.300]   God is.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:51.840]   Amen?
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.780]   Okay.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.740]   At the same time, this is also true.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:02.540]   If congregation members are hurting each other, if false teachers are allowed to speak, if there
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:09.000]   is divisive, you know, like heresies that are going around and it's allowed, it's like
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.380]   allowed to exist, that's completely on our shoulders, right?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:23.240]   In the same way, I'm going to now go into this idea of your character, your preparation, of
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:29.800]   your decision factors, of your discernment, of how forceful you will be, how strict you will
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.480]   be, all of these decisions are so important to parenting.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:40.800]   So, as a continuation of introduction to today's topic of character of the parent, I want to
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.180]   take a look at Luke chapter 6, verse 39 through 40.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:52.420]   And the Lord said this, he spoke a parable to them, a blind man cannot guide a blind man,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:52.900]   can he?
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.380]   They will, will they not both fall into a pit?
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:03.380]   A pupil is not above his teacher, but everyone after he has been fully trained will be like
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.620]   his teacher, okay?
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:14.560]   Without taking too much time on this idea, because you guys all know, you guys all know, every
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   single one of us, we have to be growing and not stagnant in our faith.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.580]   Otherwise, what we are saying is, I hope, I really, really hope that my child outpaces
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.280]   me in faith.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.980]   I hope that my child will outgrow me, okay?
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.620]   Now, in some sense, that could be a humble word, but is that realistic to say?
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:42.860]   That from ages of childhood to 18 years old, their adulthood, that they're going to outpace
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.100]   you in your Christian growth?
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.200]   No.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.860]   You have to model for them.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.180]   You have to lead them.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:53.920]   So all I'm going to just say is that, that you have to make sure that you see the power
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.380]   of your character, and just moving quickly, there is a power to your sobriety, okay?
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.040]   A power to your sobriety.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.780]   What am I talking about here?
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:14.280]   The power to your sobriety is the Christian faith for you has been described that in this
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.640]   generation, you have to be sober in spirit and be on the alert because your adversary,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.880]   the devil, prowls online like a roaring lion, seeking somewhere to devour, okay?
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:32.920]   Now, I'm going to take a moment just to say this verse, and then kind of talk about something
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.580]   Pastor Peter said, okay?
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.180]   All right.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.460]   Follow with me here just a moment.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:46.340]   Some time ago, Pastor Peter was actually talking on, I believe it was Father's Day, and he was
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.420]   talking about parenting, and he said something right at the end of his sermon, which was,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.100]   Parents, don't inoculate your kids.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.940]   You guys remember that?
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.280]   And then what's really interesting, there was kind of like a, oh shoot, what does he mean
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.460]   by that, okay?
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.460]   And a lot of people started asking me like, what do you mean by that?
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.660]   And then people started asking him, what do you mean by that, right?
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:12.640]   And people kind of mistook what he was saying was just like, oh man, I don't want to just
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.780]   like indoctrinate my kid with pounding them with kids' Bible, Bible memory verses, and then
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.880]   Sunday school, and then VBS, and then da-da-da-da-da.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.920]   That's not what he was talking about.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:31.420]   Innoctrination, if we're talking about regular, faithful, and variety of teaching of the realities
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.740]   of God, do it.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.460]   That's you being faithful.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:42.180]   But what he was actually talking about when it comes to inoculating your kid is giving them
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.920]   something like this verse.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.060]   You have to be sober in this generation.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.560]   But all you gave them was something small, like a little vaccine, and nothing more.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.480]   So that the next time we talk about it, they realize it's not that important to you.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.380]   You're on your phone all the time.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.840]   You're constantly distracted.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.380]   You say there's a roaring lion.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.720]   You say there's a devil.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.240]   You say there's a spiritual battle.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.960]   But you never act like that.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:17.640]   You know what you're doing when you behave, and the opposite of what you, like the important
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.980]   thing you just said, is you are inoculating your kids.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:27.480]   If we do small things to say, this is so important, you have to read your Bible, you have to read
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.640]   it, and then you never reference it, they can see you don't ever read it, and they can see
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.600]   it just doesn't matter to you that much.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.380]   Then we have successfully inoculated them, because we gave them the little word, we showed
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.140]   them no content.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.660]   We gave them no path to see how it's done.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.560]   We gave them no meat of, this is how we persevere through the distractions, and et cetera.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.360]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   So, with that said, I just wanted to give that push.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.700]   When we talk about let's not inoculate our kids, let's not be satisfied that, okay, you
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.700]   have to go to Sunday school, they went, and then, if you felt like you did your job and
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.800]   that was it, think, I only gave them a small bit.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.980]   That's inoculation, okay?
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:22.660]   Next, we're talking about character, we're talking about the power of essentially how your, like,
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:29.700]   system of discernment, and some of these priority things that you hold together, and one of the
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.440]   primary things that parents must do is parents must seek unity and peace, okay?
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.920]   Power of unity and peace.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.540]   So, dun-dun, right here, I thought I saw, it was a great photo I found on the internet,
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.580]   Google search success, okay?
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.140]   Good cop, bad cop, parenting.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:57.520]   What are we talking about here when we say there is a power in character of unity and
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.020]   peace?
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.180]   There is something to put off, which is this.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.480]   Parents, when it comes to raising your kids even from a really, really young age, from development,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.060]   you have to essentially be like this.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.900]   They shouldn't see light coming through between the two of you.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.860]   There should be consistent messaging from mom and dad.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:21.400]   There should be consistent application of rules, and for sure, there shouldn't be these two
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:21.940]   roles.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.340]   This person is, yay, fun, right?
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.000]   This person is, boo, discipline.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.920]   And so, the kids automatically have a very stark distinction of who does what, okay?
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:44.600]   So, if there is this massive gap where there is inconsistent rules, so dad says, dude, I
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.900]   told you, the rule is you didn't finish your work, you don't get to go to the park and play
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.340]   basketball.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:54.400]   And the mom's just like, ah, but these friends are there, and I was really looking forward to
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.660]   it, because if he goes to play basketball, then I have a little bit of quiet time, you
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.380]   can go.
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:04.280]   As soon as that happens, what you're starting to do is you're undermining the authority of
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.420]   each other, right?
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.320]   So, those kind of inconsistent set of rules shouldn't be happening.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:15.660]   And again, it is pretty common stories to say, like, you know, one person's like, you got
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.880]   to do your work, and you got to, you know, clean up the da-da-da-da-da-da, and da-da-da-da-da,
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.180]   and then the other person's like, let's have ice cream, you know, like, we'll do it later.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.120]   You don't want to have that kind of thing, okay?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.700]   Where one person's always have a fun time, and the other person is a disciplinarian.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:35.260]   Both parents need to be synced up on the same team without division, amen?
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:43.020]   But the other part of it is, make sure, especially as the children get older, that there is no
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.080]   ungodly alliances.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.360]   And you know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:53.140]   If you're already in the habit of joking like, your father, you know, da-da-da-da, and you
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:59.700]   find yourself complaining about your spouse to your own children, I would recommend just, as funny
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.380]   as that may be, sometimes it's just better not to joke that way, right?
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.660]   Why?
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:13.000]   Because there can be a very confusing, ungodly alliance that allows your children to conquer
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.440]   and divide, okay?
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:20.280]   So, I have in there number two was, you know, stop being divided and conquered.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:29.220]   You know, if there is, like, as the child grows older, a skill that children just kind of naturally
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.820]   are embedded with, I've mentioned this before, I think it's manipulation.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.680]   They'll use what they have.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.960]   They have big, cute eyes?
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.820]   For sure, they're using it, you know?
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.140]   If they've already, like, given into talking with you a certain way, and they realize, like,
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.280]   oh, if I kind of whine and complain, you give in, they'll latch onto that.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.780]   Again, if they see a gap between mom and dad, they'll ask father, like, can I do this?
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.220]   Can I do this?
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:53.840]   Can I do this?
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.120]   Father's like, no, no.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.140]   And in the end, it's like, then I'll ask mom.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.560]   Can that stuff happen?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.180]   My guess is, you did it when you were little.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.540]   You know, like, of course that can happen, right?
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:10.040]   So, again, this portion of it is make sure there is no division.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.900]   But instead, get on the same page.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.040]   Instruction must come from a unified and peaceful voice.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.480]   I want you to take another moment to imagine the church.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.320]   Imagine if our leadership's voice wasn't unified, and I was just like,
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:32.180]   I really wanted to have karaoke night singing praise songs and stuff,
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.980]   but Elder Joe, praise leader, didn't want it.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.060]   Like, what would that do to you, right?
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:43.740]   You'd be like, dude, like, the leadership's divided, right?
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.400]   If I started to complain, like, I really wanted this, we took a vote,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.140]   but it was like, you know, I just happened to be in the minority.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.820]   What is that?
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.420]   And it's the exact same thing.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:00.580]   As confusing and as disheartening that would be to you to hear that our church leadership is divided,
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:04.340]   is the same thing the child hears when the parents are divided, right?
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:10.540]   So, remember that the instruction must come from a unified and peaceful voice.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.740]   Here's a quick tip for you guys.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.520]   Number one, those of you guys who are younger parents with younger children,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.560]   go home and kind of think about, hey, what are some experiences already where we weren't on the same page?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.020]   Especially on how strict we should be.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.500]   But then, pre-plan.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.220]   I mean, you can already envision what's going to happen.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.600]   You're going to run into a time where your kid screams in public
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.540]   because he wanted attention or he wanted something,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.620]   and he thought that by making a scene, he would get you to bend to his will.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   Question, are you on the same page of what you're supposed to do?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.580]   Let's say, you know, your child, he wasn't supposed to eat the cookie,
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.960]   but then he disobeyed you and ate it, and then he lied to you.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.020]   Get on the same page.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.200]   What are we going to do about that?
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.720]   I know these are kind of silly examples,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.320]   but you'll be surprised how many parents are not on the same page
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.300]   and who's okay with what, right?
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.880]   Here's another example where people kind of disagree, okay?
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.740]   So let's say, for example, one of the older gentlemen in the room
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.100]   came over and said hi to your kid,
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.620]   and your kid did one of those, like, they're just scared,
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.260]   and then they gave a stink look, side-eye, and then hid behind your leg.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.960]   Now, you have a little debate.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.640]   It's like, nope, that's disrespect.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.620]   When an older person comes, little children need to learn how to show respect
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.800]   by saying hi, shaking their hand, or seeing them eye to eye.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.860]   You'll be surprised how many parents disagree.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.080]   It's like, dude, you can't force that kid to da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.700]   Get on the same page.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.740]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.180]   These scenarios, sometimes we're shocked it happens, but we shouldn't be.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.140]   It's going to happen.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.440]   For sure it's going to happen.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:06.060]   My advice to you is if, in the moment, in the moment, let's say, for example,
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.600]   the father decides this child needs to be disciplined for that,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.180]   and he's about to take the child away to, like, the bathroom or a private quarter,
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.080]   and the other spouse is like, no, don't hurt him, you know?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:24.160]   You're essentially going to pull that child in two entirely different directions, right?
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   Make sure it comes united voice.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:36.020]   So, that part is the united, kind of peaceful voice of the parent is essential to good parenting.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.360]   Amen?
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.680]   All right.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.940]   Next.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.860]   This is for us all.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.620]   Self-control.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.480]   The power of self-control.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.160]   Okay?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.000]   Ephesians chapter 6, verse 4, it says,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:58.180]   Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:58.920]   Okay?
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.520]   Now, I have over here this picture of rage monster, wrath, okay?
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:12.000]   And I will tell you that I, myself, I view myself as quite the patient man, you know?
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:21.120]   And there's a few times when, you know, like, in certain moments, people would just commend me and say, like, oh, you're such a patient God.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.300]   And I'm like, yes, yes, I try, you know?
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.060]   But I'll tell you what.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.960]   I'll tell you what.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:39.480]   By the time, you know, our kids were a certain age, I remember when the kids were little, being shocked at the whole prevalence of shaking baby syndrome, where the child gets shaken and stuff.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.480]   I'm just like, how in the world do people do that, you evil monsters, you know?
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:54.680]   Until that child is just like, they can't speak, they're frustrated, you're frustrated, they're screaming, they're throwing their backs, arching the thing.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:06.980]   And then, like, I think I mentioned in a previous lesson, because I had vivid memories of, like, how I reacted when my own kid, who can't even speak yet, in frustration, they'll, like, and try to hit me.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:16.460]   I felt my rage, just like, uh, Bia, you're going to have to hold this child for a minute, like, because you could feel yourself, like, lose control, you know what I mean?
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:27.900]   And what's kind of strange about this is the scriptures knows us so well, but so if you actually looked up how many passages of the Bible talk about your anger, many.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.580]   Take a moment to look at this.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:37.120]   He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules the spirit than he who captures the city.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:47.880]   So what's more powerful, mighty warrior, battle, beaten, all that kind of stuff, or an individual who can control his own temper, right?
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.440]   And that's why I say there is power in self-control.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.880]   What's more?
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.960]   Think about this.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.640]   Does the New Testament actually have a ton of instructions directly to the father, like, father, you have to do this?
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:09.140]   There's a lot of wisdom, et cetera, but a bunch of them explicitly tells the dad, fathers, do not exasperate your children so that they will not lose heart.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.600]   And then you think about the flip side.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:23.880]   When a father is going to correct, admonish, and edify his son, but he's controlled, he's actually gentle, he's methodical, he's actually going to bring life to his kid.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.580]   Rather than crush it, he's going to build it up.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.520]   Amen?
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.580]   So, quick moment's break here.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.960]   Book recommendations for all of us, okay?
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.420]   I was grateful.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:42.140]   I took a full semester class with Dr. Robert Jones in my program, and man, it was so good.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:48.320]   He wrote this book called Uprooting Anger, and this is a book, a help for you, right?
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.180]   Digging deep.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:57.560]   This is like classic, classic biblical counseling where he defines everything biblically, digs deep into our expectations,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:04.780]   our pride and our heart, and then he starts to unpack why we do what we do and where we need the stop blocks and how we need to reshape our thinking.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:05.920]   I encourage everybody to read this book.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.020]   I encourage everybody to read this book early on, okay?
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.800]   Why?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:22.620]   Because we ourselves, like children, will be provoked, and then we're going to blow up in anger, and we're going to blame everybody else and say, you made me mad.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.880]   But biblically speaking, no.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.560]   We will have provocation.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.020]   We will have stimulus.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.580]   We will have frustrations.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.840]   We will have disappointments.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.720]   But the anger is a decision we make, and that's something we have to learn.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:42.700]   Here's another book by Lou Priolo, another well-known writer within the counseling world.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:50.960]   This one's called The Heart of Anger, and it's more guided to helping prevent your child from becoming angry, okay?
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.780]   So just think of this as a resource for you guys, all right?
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.820]   I want to take this moment to jump into some practical stuff, okay?
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:11.640]   What provokes our children to anger, and what sort of things should we be watchful for so that we ourselves are not the source of the temptation for our children, okay?
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.840]   Number one, you.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.560]   Are you habitually irritable, okay?
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.580]   Are you habitually irritable?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:26.980]   Now, how many of you guys, couples, married people in here, you don't have to raise your hand because we're just going to assume it has happened.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:33.220]   Have you guys ever gotten in a fight where you got mad because the other person was mad, okay?
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.040]   Because they were irritated, you got irritated?
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.340]   And so it's just like, you're like, why are you angry?
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.040]   And just the fact that the other person was angry got you angry, and it's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know?
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   That sort of stuff can happen from our children to us, right?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:58.300]   And honestly speaking, again, I think that if we're talking about really practicals of our speech and the way that we act,
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:06.140]   if ever you've been irritated, so irritated by your child, you're just like, oh, my gosh, you're making Appa so angry, you know?
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:15.700]   I would, again, if you guys kind of saw a theme within these lessons, we're changing the way we talk and we're changing the way we react, change that verbiage.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:20.960]   Your child, yes, is disobeying you, and you can reveal that.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:28.460]   But your child is not the one making decisions for you that you would react in wrath, right?
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:37.580]   We're saying that for you, if you react in anger to what your child is doing, that is actually a decision we make where we're returning evil for evil.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:43.540]   But the scripture says, do not repay evil for evil, but repay evil with good.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.940]   And that is our call every day as parents.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:46.300]   Why?
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.320]   Scripture says our love is not provoked.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:58.240]   It does not take into account the wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with truth, and it bears all things.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.000]   Okay?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   What's more, what else provokes our children to anger?
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:08.920]   Obviously, we do not want to be in the habit of over-criticizing, scolding.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.560]   And here's another thing.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:19.440]   Is it possible, parents, we have to be careful of this, is it possible for a parent to be embittered towards their own kid?
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.960]   Yes.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.180]   Yes.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:38.080]   In counseling scenarios now, sometimes I counsel adult children, people who are in their 20s and 30s, where they will tell me, dude, my parents have said, dude, you've ruined my life.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.260]   You're the reason why I can't do da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.780]   You are the reason why I couldn't finish my thing, my program.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:52.020]   You are the, I mean, think about the embitterment in the heart that produces those kind of words to children.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.120]   We have to be very, very cautious of the sentiment of our own heart.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:08.980]   And I want to highlight this idea that is it easy for us, even not just our relationship between parent and child, but even amongst friends,
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:18.860]   isn't it super easy for us to see fault, to see deficiency, to see sin and be like, boop, there it is, but without finding solutions?
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:29.020]   If we're quick to do that, and we're sharp with our judgment, but we have no solutions, our children will get exasperated, okay?
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.880]   And as a matter of fact, that was Job's thing to his friends.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:38.620]   It's like, dude, you guys are supposed to be my friends, but all you've said to me was, you must be sinning, you must be sinning.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.560]   But you provided zero answers.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.200]   That's what he's saying.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.800]   It's like, there's no solution.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.060]   There was no path to anything.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.060]   You just condemn me, condemn me, condemn me.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.560]   You're saying I may be sinning and all that kind of stuff.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.500]   And he was like, yeah, I'm a man.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.960]   I don't know of anything I'm doing, but all you've done is just poked at me.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.080]   And he was absolutely exasperated, okay?
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.000]   Proverbs 15, 1.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.500]   A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.100]   We want to keep this in mind, okay?
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:27.560]   Especially, especially in our, like, let's say you get to a certain point, your children are getting a little bit older, you feel like you can expect more out of them, you let your guard down because your hopes are high, and you find yourself getting frustrated.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:37.780]   It's easy when your guard is down to just say quick, snapping instructions, things the way that you would treat nobody else.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.720]   And I've got to be honest with you, it's like that in marriage, too.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.840]   The person we love most, sometimes we speak to like nobody else, right?
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.680]   Many people, like, we know that's true.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:38:03.420]   When we get offended or hurt, or we let our guard down, the person we love most will actually speak to, in comparison, like nobody else.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.960]   We wouldn't be that harsh, we wouldn't be that frank, and we wouldn't be that rude, okay?
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.380]   Another thing that provokes our children to anger.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.300]   We have to make sure that our standards are consistent.
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:20.520]   And also, obviously, that we play no favorites, okay?
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.420]   We play no favorites.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:28.460]   So, I want to take a moment.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:33.740]   Today, I'm not going to try to fake names or, you know, try to think about some young girls.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.420]   I'm going to talk about my sons, okay?
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:44.620]   Within Korean culture, favoritism is just assumed.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.600]   If you have, like, a bunch of girls and a son, we know who's the favorite, right?
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.480]   If you have a pecking order, we know who's the favorite, that kind of stuff.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:57.060]   So, I vowed, when I have kids, I will have no favorites.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.860]   Yes?
[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.500]   Okay.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.800]   But then I realized, oh, it comes out in a subtle way.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.180]   Why?
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:08.980]   Because there are certain kids where they're more difficult and they're more stubborn, so you expect them to push back.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.200]   And then there are other kids where they're actually really obedient and you expect a lot of them.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.660]   So, when they disobey, you actually treat them differently.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.560]   I found that to be the case.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.000]   So, let's talk about lies.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Early on, for me, one of the things that completely tempted me to blow my lid and become angry was lying.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:36.420]   And we would tell our boys, if you did something disobedient, that's one.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.080]   If you lie about it, you stack sin on sin.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.400]   Don't do that.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.040]   We love you.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.700]   I know you're afraid of consequences.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.340]   And then so, we would do the heart thing.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.720]   Why did you disobey?
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.280]   Da-da-da-da-da.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.020]   It's like, oh, I wanted to play.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.760]   And then we do the, like, I know you love playing so much, da-da-da-da-da, but God wants you to love this.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.360]   And God wants you to be a, you know, righteous man, etc.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   All that stuff, okay?
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.520]   But then if they lie, they don't just get one discipline.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.260]   They get two, okay?
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.160]   All right.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:14.400]   But think about the scenario is, between the two kids, is there a difference between one kid lying to me to another?
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.820]   It should be the same, right?
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:26.480]   But earlier, what I said is, because of your expectations, and because, technically, you get a little bit more hurt, like, I expected this out of this one, but not you.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.600]   You know, like, it's that kind of mentality, and I realize, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.940]   I'm just reacting.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.520]   I'm not even thinking through this.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.940]   It has to be consistent.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.020]   What am I doing?
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.360]   I'm allowing myself to get offended, is what's happening.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.700]   Does that make sense?
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:48.100]   Parents, your reaction needs to be consistent, or you will exasperate a child, right?
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:41:04.280]   And what's more, when we think about, like, how we instruct them, it's like, it has to be consistent, because, unfortunately, when it's not, it ends up becoming about you.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.660]   It ends up becoming about your preferences.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.480]   It ends up becoming about your expectations, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.340]   So, all I'm going to say there is, again, the standards have to be applied consistently across the board.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.900]   Here's another.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.920]   What provokes a child?
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:29.700]   When you go to discipline or correct your children, reproving them in public is actually harsh.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:42.000]   And the reason why is because you want that, like, correction, the discipline, and the admonition to actually be an intimate thing.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.940]   That's supposed to be your love on the child.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.580]   You do it in public.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.360]   They don't feel your love.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.200]   They feel everyone's hands.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.220]   They feel everyone's eyes.
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:59.000]   You know as well as I do, if you look at a young child, that young child is already self-aware.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:41:59.740]   Yes?
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:06.620]   That children already from, like, a year and a half, maybe even earlier, they recognize when they're in public eye.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.040]   They recognize when, oh, shoot, and so they all act differently in the privacy of their home.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.840]   They all act differently when somebody's watching.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.920]   And even as kids super young as a year and a half, they mess up.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.140]   They're playing with the toy.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.720]   It cracks and everything spills.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.320]   They'll be fine except when somebody's watching.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:28.100]   All of a sudden, they're just like, oh, my gosh, life is over.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:32.200]   And they're crying like, you know, the world has just ended.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.860]   Why?
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:40.660]   Because we, as humans, are already embedded with that kind of conscience, the conscience of other people.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:47.520]   So my exhortation to you is we have to make sure that we are not reproving the children publicly.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.100]   When disciplining, I always recommend taking them into an intimate place, locking eyes with them,
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:43:01.260]   and making sure they know this is my intimate moment with you, my love of discipline, me treating you like my son.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:01.840]   Yes?
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.640]   Okay.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.040]   The other is not listening well.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:12.120]   Now, I, you know, again, with a level of caveat, like, we're not in this kind of, like, listen to your children.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.220]   They're, like, you know, holy children who have so much to say.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:21.360]   But definitely, even for you and me, if we're misunderstood, incredibly frustrating.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.960]   If we're falsely accused, incredibly frustrating.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.200]   Between husband and wife, you feel like your husband doesn't understand you.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.080]   They're not even trying to understand you.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.740]   They're just rebuking you by, like, you did this before, so I know it's your problem now.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.040]   Extremely, extremely frustrating.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.360]   Yes?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.680]   What does Scripture say?
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.340]   James 1, verse 19 through 20 says,
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:58.980]   Now that my boys are older, I commend you guys to do this.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.420]   Cross-check to see, did I understand you correctly?
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.500]   Right?
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.480]   Son, you said this, this, this, this.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.660]   Is this what you mean?
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.640]   Was this what you're saying was important to you?
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.000]   Is this what you're saying that you were hurt by?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.220]   Is this what you're angry about?
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.980]   I cross-check and make them repeat to me.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:19.540]   Sometimes, they'll auto-correct.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:23.440]   Having to say something twice, they'll just immediately auto-correct.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.180]   But what that does is, it causes you to be trustworthy.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:33.420]   Because he who makes the decision before hearing a matter, that's to your folly.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:41.620]   But if you're making wise discernment about even their, your correction, you're trustworthy even in your rebuke.
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.160]   Okay?
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.580]   Now, what I'm going to say is this.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:53.300]   Right now, we just walk through some common, very common ways that every single person can potentially provoke,
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.600]   not just our children, but our spouses, other friends.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.720]   These are things that practically every single one of us should be cautious about.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.260]   Okay?
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.120]   But, being angry and irritated is a universal problem.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:15.000]   Make sure, brothers and sisters, do not discipline your child in a fit of anger.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.900]   Okay?
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:22.600]   Control yourselves before even speaking that kind of correction immediately.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.320]   It's tempting.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.700]   It feels like it's necessary.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:32.220]   Control yourselves with power of Christ before correcting that child.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.740]   Why?
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.880]   Because this passage, when it tells us, do not provoke your children,
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.760]   it's juxtaposed to the goal of your parenting.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.680]   Isn't it?
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.620]   This passage, in one simple phrase, has given you the two paths.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.260]   You can either take control and just pound it out,
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:58.500]   and you can try to exercise your might to bring about the righteousness in your child.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.000]   However, what does the Scripture say?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.320]   James 1, verse 20 says,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.880]   The anger of man does not achieve this.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.700]   God said, you're going to be in the exercise of folly.
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.620]   What's more, you are going to develop horrible fruit.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:20.680]   Now, I'm going to do one practical example.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.660]   It has been in common practice to give timeouts to children,
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.920]   especially when parents do not want to discipline them.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:31.420]   Without making a law or rule, sometimes timeouts are necessary.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.940]   When a kid is crazily out of control, etc.,
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.680]   they're like, timeout!
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.940]   Everybody freeze!
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.180]   Just extract them from the scenario.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.920]   Even then, my wife and I, we decided really early on,
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.040]   like, should we do timeouts?
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.420]   And we started thinking back to our younger days
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.080]   when our parents would be like, face the corner,
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.740]   and we'd get into, like, the corner.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.180]   And then you're just like, you know,
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.440]   basically unclean and put onto the, you know, quarantine zone.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.860]   And then we realized, I don't know what that communicated.
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:07.200]   But, number one, that wasn't fruitful.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:10.940]   Number one, the fruit of typically timeout is,
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.640]   the kid does not heed your command.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.060]   Go in the corner and think about what you did.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:16.960]   Do you know what they do?
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.840]   They seed in anger against you.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.260]   And they start to make embittered sentiments of,
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:27.160]   this is not fair, my mom hates me, my dad doesn't like me.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:31.120]   Quick note, imagine if you did that in anger.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.580]   Get in the corner and think about what you did.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.180]   That is the exact opposite of everything we're saying
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.660]   is the goal of parenting, which is, even in your discipline,
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.920]   it's an intimate moment of love.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.540]   It's a redemptive act of drawing them close
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:51.460]   and causing them to yield to your kind and good intention.
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.900]   I want so much more for you, son.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.960]   I want the vision of Christ.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.440]   I want the fullness measure, the full stature of Christ in you.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.160]   I know you feel like you're not there,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.700]   and this is why you need redemption.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.820]   You stay close with me.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.720]   I'll guide you there.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.800]   Follow what I'm telling you because I'm going to show you.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.720]   So, we started doing this.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.320]   This kid goes berserk.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.560]   He's just doing this, like, you know.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.400]   We'll grab them and be like, we're going to sit together.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.820]   Okay, let's sit face to face.
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:25.620]   I'm going to wait it out.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.600]   You need to stop crying.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.840]   I can wait.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.760]   You need to stop crying.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.420]   And then you're like,
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.520]   they just kind of start feeling awkward, right?
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.500]   Because it's not working, right?
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.300]   It's not working.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.420]   They're raging.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.500]   You just weathered the storm, right?
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.440]   They're raging.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.060]   They're complaining.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:47.820]   It's just not working.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:48.680]   You're not fazed.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.400]   I love you to death.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.580]   I'm not leaving you.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.800]   We're right here.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.760]   Okay.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:54.560]   What hurt the most?
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.500]   What made you so mad?
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.080]   Okay.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.980]   Like, what are you thinking about right now?
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.260]   And then, yeah, okay.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.080]   I'll wait.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.020]   You tell me.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.200]   Right?
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.680]   We didn't do timeouts.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.280]   It was, we just locked eyes and kept it right in front of us.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:21.780]   But, my point was, in this disciplinary act, though, if because of frustration, expediency,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.800]   and trying to get the kid to be controlled, you exhibit your rage to control the child,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.320]   you end up pushing them far away.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.060]   That's my point.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.400]   You want them right in front of you.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.860]   You know, Pastor Peter did this thing one time.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.900]   This was many years ago, almost a decade ago.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.040]   But the picture just seared in my brain.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.880]   And when I think of it, I pretty much, whoa, I'm getting emotional just thinking of it now.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.220]   It breaks me to tears.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.660]   And what it was was, there was a brother at church that committed some heinous sins.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:50:00.420]   And it was like, dude, you need to get, we need to put a stop to it.
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:00.900]   And we did.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.520]   We also needed to talk to him.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.920]   We needed to make sure there were parameters.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.760]   We needed to make sure there was accountability.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.240]   We needed to make sure there was clear teaching.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.020]   And we needed to make it crystal clear what we expect out of him.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.980]   So I was like, oh, shoot, Pastor Peter and I, we went together, you know.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.400]   And at the time, it was just the two of us.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.200]   There was no other pastors.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.660]   We got in there, and I was like, Pastor Peter's the man.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.000]   He's going to let this guy have it, you know.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:36.160]   He looked at this young man, and he said, you know, sometimes as a father, when your son is in sin, the father gives extra attention.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.520]   The father loves you, he's giving you extra attention.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.360]   I'm like, oh, my God.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.080]   I just started weeping, you know.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:53.760]   And what happened there was, Pastor Peter, like, dismantled every wall.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:00.060]   He just, like, dismantled all the common, just, like, defenses and all that kind of stuff.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:08.320]   Just by saying, like, we're here with the father's love giving you extra attention, right?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.620]   Because he loves you.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:14.900]   Don't see us coming at you with, like, sideways and trying to attack you.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:20.780]   And in that same way, our discipline cannot come with the attack of anger.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.840]   Yes?
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:29.520]   The power of our self-control will exhibit this incredible amount of trust from the child to us.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:37.480]   And therefore, we have to continue to exhibit that kind of loving, bringing up mentality in the discipline of the Lord.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:46.200]   If we, if we do not get that under wraps, what will eventually happen is two things.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.140]   You will become the child's idol, or in secret, far from you, they will sin, sin, sin.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.700]   That's not a promise.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.440]   That's just what we've seen through life.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.120]   Next.
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:01.360]   The power of the parent's courage.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.140]   Okay?
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.780]   The power of the parent's courage.
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:11.200]   So, you know, there's fears every way, every direction.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.800]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.100]   Am I just overboard?
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.100]   Am I just destroying this kid?
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:17.280]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.640]   I am destroying this kid, and I'm going to hurt him and give him trauma.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.300]   There's fears everywhere, okay?
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.020]   In parenting.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:32.500]   And I want to challenge you that you have to have courage to bring sorrow to your child in the loving correction.
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.140]   Take a moment to think about Apostle Paul's mentality and perspective.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:36.940]   Okay?
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.080]   He says,
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.800]   For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.460]   For I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:54.960]   I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:03.380]   For you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:04.340]   Okay?
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.840]   So, think about, man, Apostle Paul can sympathize with all of us.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.240]   Oh, my gosh, I'm doing too much.
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.340]   I'm not doing enough, right?
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.520]   But he came with conviction and said, with courage, this is the will of God.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:23.620]   I have to correct what I have to correct.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.560]   And came with a level of certainty.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.640]   This is right by the will of the Lord.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:29.220]   Yes?
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:38.420]   And so, what he said was, you were made sorrowful, and I rejoice in this, that the sorrow produced in you this incredible fruit.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:45.540]   So, there are ways of being, like, afraid and lacking courage.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.760]   Question to you by way of evaluation.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.420]   In what ways do you struggle to have courage?
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.000]   Okay?
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.940]   Here he is, the scaredy lion, who has no heart, right?
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.380]   He's just afraid.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:05.300]   What, in what way do you wrestle with fears that are preventing you from doing certain things that you know to be right?
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.740]   Now, we may not be aware, but here are some common things.
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.300]   Okay?
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:16.500]   Like, in some sense, laziness, laziness is fear.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.020]   It's a kind of self-imposed fear.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:19.880]   Okay?
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:24.740]   Laziness is a kind of, like, this is too much for me, fear.
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:28.600]   Laziness can sometimes be, like, I don't know what to say, fear.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.780]   There's a lot of fears that come into our way.
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:36.280]   You know what's really interesting is that in the book of Proverbs, when it talks about a man who's stricken with fear,
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.500]   he's typically, like, when he's not doing his responsibility, he'll say,
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.140]   Oh, my goodness, in the streets, there's lions and bears.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.980]   What's he saying?
[00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.700]   If I try, it's not going to work.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.600]   If I go out, it's going to be dangerous.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:55.880]   So, do parents sometimes exhibit a level of fear that ends up looking like passivity and laziness?
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:56.880]   The answer is yes.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.120]   Do you wrestle with some of that?
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:06.300]   There is a passivity that's just straight, like, you know, like, who knows who's more gifted at this?
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.140]   She is.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.800]   You know, there are some guys who think like that.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   It's like, I didn't grow up, like, you know, talking to little kids.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.620]   I'm just going to make it super awkward.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:17.980]   She's the nurturer, and a lot of guys, this is really common amongst guys,
[00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:23.200]   is they're passive because the women they think are better at it.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.880]   Don't do that.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.300]   That's actually a lack of courage.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.940]   And then there are times when you just give up.
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:33.980]   There's this verbiage and talk of, like, I can't do this, you know?
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.300]   I wasn't cut out for this, and da-da-da-da-da.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.300]   That's also a lack of courage.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.380]   Here's some more, okay?
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:46.740]   What I've seen, I have counseled and talked to people where they are so afraid of hurting their child.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.540]   Scripture in the book of Proverbs has told us,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.860]   Do not spare the rod, he will not die, okay?
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.160]   Do not spare the rod.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.600]   Though you hurt him for a moment, he is going to learn from this, okay?
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.180]   But there's definitely this fear of, like, oh, my gosh, I'm going to be hurt.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.540]   But there are other fears.
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:10.960]   Are you afraid that your child is just going to hate you and be embittered against you?
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   Okay?
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.900]   Weather the storm.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:20.260]   If you have clarity of conscience that you are not enraged, you are not in wrath, you are not in anger,
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:25.680]   but with control, you are correcting your child in the discipline of the Lord,
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.780]   you weather the storm.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.260]   They're going to react.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.120]   But by your persistence, by your perseverance, you will prove it.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.560]   Thank you.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:40.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:45.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.120]   Thank you.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:07.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:09.120]   Thank you.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.760]   All right. Thank you. Let's give it up for the AV guys.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:45.900]   Doing a hard job back in the sweaty box back there.
[00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:56.820]   Okay. All right. That in fear of the child being deprived of some of the joys that you
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:04.320]   were deprived of, that's unfortunately one of the dangers that causes us to give in to
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:10.000]   our children much more than we ought to. Right? I'm just highlighting things that are common
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.900]   to all men. See some of this list and check your heart to see, do I wrestle with some of
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:26.300]   this? Do not allow your fear to set your goals. Your fear is not a good philosophy of ministry.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:34.120]   Your fear is not a good system of parenting. Yes? Your fear actually is going to hinder
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:40.860]   you from staying the course. So I'm going to go ahead and start wrapping things up here and review
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:47.940]   with us. We said today that there are some really important character traits that will have its
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:54.000]   application in our parenting. Number one, we said your character just of like loving God with everything
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:05.380]   you're having to have it. If you're complaining like, oh my goodness, my children love screen time so much,
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:12.800]   they're addicted to it. Take a moment to check your phone's screen time. How many hours do you spend?
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:21.340]   Because the degree that you, right? The degree that you allow yourself to be distracted by entertainment
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:27.580]   and screen is only the launching pad for them. That's what's permissible to go. Okay?
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:35.200]   What's more, we said your character of seeking unity and peace, you and your spouse trying to be this,
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:42.240]   will have its practical application in how much your children feel the freedom to go ahead and push their
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:50.620]   agenda. What's more, of course, your character of self-control. That you are a man and woman
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:58.060]   that has your wrath, temper, you have your irritations, all controlled by the Spirit of God,
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:05.080]   is going to create that kind of trust and loving direction where it's not about you. Where the
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:11.900]   offense is not, oh my gosh, I offended dad. Because you have to make a beeline to God and say,
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:19.140]   your sins makes an offense to God. It's not even about me. It's about you and God. And then finally,
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:24.700]   that you have the courage to do, yes, a lot of things that might even produce,
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.320]   maybe even tempt your children to look at you as though you're the enemy or the bad cop.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:36.040]   But you have that courage to say, I'm going to do for you that which will produce fruit in you.
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:41.480]   If it brings you sorrow, I rejoice. It's the will of God. Amen? Let's pray.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:53.740]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, that God, you endure with us. And Father, we thank you so much
[01:00:53.740 --> 01:01:02.500]   because the way you have described it is that you wooed us and your kindness melted our pride
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.520]   and your gentle, kind spirit brought us to repentance.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.900]   But never did you hide, Lord God, your truth. Never did you lower our standards.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.560]   Never did you say, that's just okay.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:24.740]   God, your heart to transform, to train us was so, so true. I pray, God, we would mimic this kind of
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:31.980]   persevering character. Help us, Lord God, to exhibit this kind of endurance. And Lord, we really pray that
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.420]   in the next generation within our children, then you would bear the appropriate fruit. We thank you.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.960]   Jesus Christ's name, amen.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:45.180]   Okay, so just one question for you guys. On your handout, I put some other discussion questions.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:50.360]   Throughout the lesson, I kind of gave, like, for you parents who are parents now,
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:56.660]   again, get on the same page, pre-planned scenarios, and talk about things you disagree on, okay?
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:04.940]   But just on one question for you tonight, which area of these character traits are a threat or
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.840]   opportunity for you to grow, okay? Just share that one question, and then we'll be done for the evening,
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.880]   okay? Thanks, everybody.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.480]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:19.340]   Thank you, everybody.
