[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   We come now to the Word of God, the Scripture, and I ask you to open your Bible to Ephesians,
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.720]   the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:20.200]   We are working our way through Ephesians and find ourselves at Ephesians, chapter 5.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200]   And this becomes for us a high point.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.480]   That's hard to say with regard to Ephesians because everything seems like a high point,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.020]   but this is indeed a high point.
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.460]   I want to read the opening seven verses of chapter 5 for you, though we'll only cover
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.980]   the first two; at least you'll have them in mind.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.760]   Ephesians 5:1, "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.660]   just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.440]   God as a fragrant aroma.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.440]   "
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.360]   "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.500]   among saints.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.100]   And there must be no filthiness and silly talk or coarse jesting, which are not fitting,
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.860]   but rather giving of thanks; for this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure
[00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.680]   person or covetous man who is an idolater has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.400]   and God.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.020]   Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.180]   upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.120]   Therefore do not be partakers with them."
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320]   This wonderful passage begins in the clouds.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.540]   It begins in the lofty, heavenly stratosphere of being imitators of God, and it ends down
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.360]   on earth with the...
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   Sinful lists that are provided for us, which we are to avoid, that lead finally, as verse
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.860]   6 says, to the wrath of God.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.200]   And again, we are reminded that we are to have no part with that.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.360]   And that is a theme all through the book of Ephesians.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.780]   We saw that, didn't we, back in chapter 4 and verse 22?
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.120]   If you are a believer in Christ, you had a former life.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.320]   But you laid aside...
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.440]   The old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   You were renewed in the spirit of your mind, and you put on the new self, which in the
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.260]   likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.460]   This is the very main thrust of this wonderful epistle.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.280]   And I've been pointing you back to chapter 2, verse 10: "We are, as those who have
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.460]   been saved, the workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus four good works, which God
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.880]   prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them."
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.020]   We've been learning from the book of Ephesians that salvation is a total transformation.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.240]   It is complete change.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.280]   It is going 180 degrees in the opposite direction.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.240]   It is ceasing to be under the authority and power of Satan.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.220]   As it tells us in the beginning of chapter 2, "Walking according to the course of this
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.720]   world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the Spirit, now working in the
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.820]   sons of disobedience."
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.840]   It ceases to be that, and instead of walking in the power of Satan, chapter 3 ends with
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.260]   verse 19, saying, "We now can be filled up to all the fullness of God."
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.840]   That's how dramatic the transformation is.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.200]   And again, this seems to be a question.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.820]   It's a question that's been asked so many, many times.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.380]   How do I know I am a true Christian?
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.500]   And we've learned the answers very clearly through the book of Ephesians, and we'll see
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.200]   it again this morning.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.260]   Now we are called to something in verse 1 of chapter 5 that may on its surface seem
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.240]   like too high a standard.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:27.160]   Notice verse 1: "Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love."
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.080]   "Be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.680]   Since we are His loved children, since He loved us enough to make us His children, and
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.380]   since as a result of that we have become partakers of the divine nature - that's what Peter says
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:54.060]   - we have become partakers of the divine nature, we have the capacity now to imitate God, and
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.120]   in one particular way: walking in love.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.480]   Walking in love.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.300]   So we're going to talk about walking in love.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.480]   This is the high point of the Christian's calling.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.820]   Now we know back in chapter 4, verse 1, we were called to walk worthy of the calling
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.940]   to which we have been called, and we are to walk in humility and gentleness with patience,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.080]   showing tolerance for one another in love.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   So again, we don't get very far into the word.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.560]   We don't get very far into the word "worthy walk" until we run into this idea of loving
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.260]   people with a love that can be defined as tolerance.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:42.460]   But it's defined even more directly here in this section, chapter 5, because we are to
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.380]   walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.940]   a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.040]   So now we understand love.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.980]   Love as more than just tolerance.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.980]   We understand love as sacrifice.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.120]   And it doesn't even stop there.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.200]   If you go back to the end of chapter 4, love is defined even further.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.020]   Verse 32: "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted," and here's the high point, "forgiving each
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.900]   other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you."
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.460]   So I want you to understand today.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.000]   This is the foundation.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.940]   This is the foundational truth that we're dealing with.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:38.660]   You can imitate God in the sense that your love is at its highest point a forgiving love.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.100]   I want you to connect that love with the reality of forgiveness.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.800]   If you're going to be like God, you're going to have to be forgiving.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.900]   And if you're going to be like God, you're going to have to be all-forgiving, comprehensively
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.960]   forgiving, full of mercy, full of grace.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.500]   Full of compassion, full of forgiveness.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.440]   At first, it might seem like it's asking way too much for us to be like God.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.680]   But the Bible doesn't back down with that at all.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.620]   In fact, when we're told to be imitators of God, we're immediately drawn to what Peter
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.620]   said.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.920]   Listen to these words, 1 Peter 1:15: "But like the Holy One who called you, be holy your
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.340]   selves also in all your behavior, because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.540]   holy.'"
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:41.460]   You think the standard is high in terms of loving; it's high also in terms of holiness.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.380]   Let me read that again: "Be like the Holy One who called you," - that's God Himself
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:54.960]   - "be holy yourselves also in all your behavior, because it is written, 'You shall be holy,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.120]   for I am holy.'"
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.880]   Where is that written?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.780]   It's back in the book of Leviticus in a number of places, but you can check out chapter 11,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.180]   verses 44 and 45.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.800]   Even in the Pentateuch, God was saying, "I want you to be holy as I am holy."
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.880]   We are called on to be like God.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:23.480]   This is the unattainable and yet necessary standard for the Christian life.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.840]   But in order to capture exactly what Paul is driving at…
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.500]   He doesn't expect us to be like God in creative power.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.260]   He doesn't expect us to be like God in immutability, because we are ever-changing; He is not.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.140]   He doesn't expect us to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.820]   We're bounded by time and space.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.460]   He doesn't expect us to be like God in omnipotence, all-powerful.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.860]   He doesn't expect us to be like God as omniscient, with all knowledge and all wisdom.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.800]   But what he is saying here is that we are to be like God.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   He is to be like God in omnipresence.
