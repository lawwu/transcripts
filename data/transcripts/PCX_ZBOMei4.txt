[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, John Piper is a big advocate for seeing glimpses of the peculiar glory of Christ in Scripture.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And those moments of discovery in his Bible are far more than mere intellectual discoveries.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   They are affectional. They feed within him his delight in God.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So the question then becomes, well, John Piper, what does it feel like to see the beauty of Christ?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And this bold question comes from a listener named Josephine.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Hello, Pastor John. I love to read my Bible every day and get to know God better.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And I have heard you talk about the importance of not just reading the Bible,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   but reading in such a way as to see the peculiar glory of Christ shining from the pages into our eyes to stir our hearts.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   It's a very unique type of reading, requiring genuine faith, regeneration, and of course the power of the Spirit.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   But I don't really know if or how or when this happens in my life.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Sometimes I make discoveries in the text that really stir my heart. Sometimes I don't.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Can you bring us into your own Bible reading and articulate for me the difference between simply reading the Bible
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and those precious times in which you are met with the glory of Christ shining in the pages of Scripture?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I presume this does not always happen, but what's it like for you when it does?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Okay, as risky as it is, I'll try to give you a glimpse into this morning's meeting with God in Scripture.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And I say it's risky because our fallen heart, our sinful heart, John Piper's sinful heart,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   is so primed for pride that to speak of our own experiences almost inevitably passes over into boasting.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   As contradictory and insane as that is, such is the nature of our remaining corruption.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But perhaps, since you asked, the good may outweigh the risk in this case.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   One of the reasons we don't meet God profoundly in his Word as often as we would like
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   is because our hearts are so unprepared and out of sync with spiritual reality when we come.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Wesley Duell, in his book Let God Guide You Daily, page 77, said,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   "I have at times read as many as 50 chapters from God's Word before I was completely alone with God."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now, don't hear me saying when I quote that.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Here we have a nice, neat daily prescription for how to get alone with God, namely,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   read 50 chapters of the Bible, then you'll be in tune.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   We all know that's unrealistic, but I mention it for two reasons.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   One is to point out the fact that we may be that out of sync spiritually and emotionally and psychologically
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   with the Bible, so that when we read, our frame of mind and the disposition of our heart
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and the spiritual receptivity of our heart are so out of step with the spirit of the passage
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   that we're reading that nothing happens. It can't happen.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And the other reason is to say that even though reading 50 chapters of the Bible every day is unrealistic,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   reading 50 chapters on a two-day retreat in solitude in a motel that your spouse gave you as a gift
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   is not unrealistic. Have you ever pursued it? Have you ever asked for it?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Have you ever gone that hard after God?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So many people complain about God not meeting them.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They've never even conceived of what Wesley Duell regularly does to find God in his Word.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   One of the ways that I seek to have my heart prepared for Scripture is to sometimes spend 15 or 20 minutes
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   reading a book by someone who I have learned over the years has seen more glory in the Scriptures than I have,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   and they're very good at showing it to me.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Their sight and their experience prepares me for my sight and my experience.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Their taste prepares me for my taste.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So this morning I read this on page 159 of Volume 1 of the works of John Owen, these words.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   "I'm sitting in my chair in complete solitude and quietness," and here's what Owen wrote.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   "There is more glory under the eye of God," and I think what he means by that is there's more glory in the sight of God
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   that God sees and recognizes.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   "There's more glory under the eye of God in the sighs, groans, and mournings of poor souls
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   filled with the love of Christ, pursuing after the enjoyment of him according to his promises.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He sees more glory in their fervent prayers for his manifestation of himself unto them,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   in the refreshments and unspeakable joys which they have in his gracious visits and embraces of his love,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   than in the thrones and diadems of all the monarchs on the earth.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Nor will the poor, sighing, groaning, seeking souls part with the ineffable satisfactions
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   which they have in these things for all that is in the world or that the world can do for them or unto them."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   When I read that this morning, there rose up in my heart a strong yes.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Yes, Lord. Yes. I am sighing. I am groaning. I am mourning.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I am longing for these enjoyments, for these refreshments, for these unspeakable pleasures,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   for these visits and embraces of the love of Christ. I want them more than I want all the world or what it can do for me.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And in the very longing and crying out, I tasted the love of Christ for me, the visit of Christ.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Don't you think that C.S. Lewis is absolutely right in what he says over and over again,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   namely, that the perfect fullness of the enjoyment of Christ reserved for the future,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   when we meet him face to face and all our sin and all the hindrances to joy are removed,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   as it says in 1 John 3, that perfect fullness of the enjoyment of Christ's presence is experienced really,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   substantively, authentically, spiritually in the very longings for it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's an artificial thing to separate our deepest yearnings and achings and longings and cryings for Christ
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   from his presence and his sweetness and the tastes of his visits and his love.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   That's an artificial distinction. The longings are themselves a sweet taste of the bread of heaven.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The yearnings are themselves a sweet detection of the aroma of paradise.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   The inconsolable desires of your soul for Christ are themselves a divine work of the Holy Spirit
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   communicating to you in advance some measure of the sweetness of Christ himself in heaven.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Then, having spent about 20 minutes reading John Owen, I turned to the next reading appointed in my pilgrimage through the Bible.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   So I'm using the Discipleship Journal reading plan that gets me through the Bible in a year.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And the next text appointed for me was Romans chapter 9.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And I will tell you straight up that there are three other places appointed for me to read today—Deuteronomy, Psalms, Matthew—
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   and I did not read them this morning. I will do that this evening.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   God met me in Romans 9 in such a way that I felt that to walk away from Romans 9 to Deuteronomy or Matthew or Psalms
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   would be to walk away from God's work in my life.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Now, this is a very familiar chapter to me. I have read Romans 9 a hundred times,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and I wrote a big book on the first 23 verses of this chapter.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And it is the curse of fallen man that familiarity breeds contempt, or at least indifference.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And I am not immune to being callous to Scripture because I know it so well.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   But God had prepared me through his servant, John Owen.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And there it was in a frame, a disposition, a tenderness, a susceptibility, a readiness.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And for some reason, and I do not know why, when I got to verse 14, 15, and 16, God showed up in an unusual way.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And you're right. This does not happen every time I read my Bible.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But now this next sentence I'm going to say really matters because so many people say,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "Well, what's the use? Blah, blah, blah."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   No! When he does, it's worth a year's reading for.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I mean, if he showed up once a year, it would be worth reading every day, wouldn't it?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I mean, come on. Are we real or are we fake?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So I read this. "What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   By no means. For he says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   So then it depends not on the one who wills or runs, but on God who has mercy."
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Now Paul is raising the issue of God's justice here because of his choosing Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   because—or before—they were born or had done anything good or evil.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And Paul's answer is no, no. God is not unjust in his choice of one over the other.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Why? Because "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   This is God talking. In other words, because I do what I do in freedom,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   my doings, my choosings are not governed by forces outside of me, John Piper.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I am God. This is part of my glory as God. And it is always just to uphold God and to act as God in his glory.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And then he interprets what he means when he says that in Exodus and says,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   "My doings, my choices are not owing to man's willing or running."
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Not man's choices, not man's deeds, but are owing to God who has mercy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And all I know to say is, for the next half hour or so, my mind moved back and forth,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   back and forth through Romans chapter 9 as the absolute freedom and righteousness of God washed over me,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   subdued me, broke my presumptions, shut my mouth, filled me with thankfulness,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   caused me to weep for lost people very, very close to me, gave me sweet assurance
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   that God can do anything he please in this world in absolute freedom and sovereignty,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   and therefore, there is hope. So much more happened, but time is up,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and I hope that gives you a little glimpse into what you were asking about.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Insightful. Thank you for taking us into your experience this morning, Pastor John. Appreciate that.

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Well, speaking of great questions, none other than C.S. Lewis himself seemed to see that God's glory and our joy were interlinked.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But he also seemed to say that the penny will drop on this connection for most Christians on the other side of eternity, not in this life.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   In other words, most Christians will not grasp Christian hedonism in this life.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So would C.S. Lewis say that our labors at DG is aiming at goals that are premature?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Wow. I am so glad I get to ask the questions. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Friday.
