[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   are to be found in that chapter which we read at the beginning, namely the 63rd chapter
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And considering it especially from verse 7 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Now I take it like this because here we have recorded the prayer of the prophet.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Most of you will recall and remember that in the 62nd chapter, the previous chapter,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   the prophet has been outlining the condition and has arrived at certain conclusions
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   and has made certain resolves, seeing the state of the church, the nation as it then was.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   The prophet decides to set watchmen upon the wall and to call upon his fellow countrymen
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   to engage in ceaseless prayer.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   The essence, you remember, of the decision was that they would not take any rest themselves
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   and they would give God no rest until Jerusalem once more had become a praise in the earth.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Now the prophet prays thus and arrives at this decision, as I say, because of the condition of Israel.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Because of the forsaken and desolate character of God's people at that time.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   He has in mind, of course, the Chaldean captivity, the taking away of the children of Israel
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   to the captivity of Babylon, that's the primary thing in his mind.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But he doesn't stop at that.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It goes on undoubtedly to the end of all time and is therefore a picture which is appropriate
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   to the condition and the life of the church in any period of declension and of suffering.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And therefore we are taking this great passage in the prophet's prophecy
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   in order that we may learn certain lessons for ourselves.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Well, now there was his decision.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And then you remember we saw last Sunday morning in the first six verses of this chapter
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   that God vouchsafed to give him a vision.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   God so often has done this.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He does it to encourage his people.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Lest they be wearied and faint in their minds, lest they be entirely overwhelmed,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   he gives an encouragement.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   He gave them a glimpse of their glorious deliverer and of his final victory.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And thus, being encouraged by God through the vision, the prophet proceeds to offer up his prayer.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And it is to this prayer that I am anxious to call attention this morning.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   It begins here at the seventh verse of the sixty-third chapter
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   and it really goes on to the very end of chapter sixty-four.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   But we obviously can't take it as a whole, but we can take certain big sections.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And I am proposing to do that this morning.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Now my concern is just to hold the prophet's prayer before you
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and merely to comment upon it and to underline what I would regard as its leading principles.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And I do this because I feel that it is necessary that we all should be instructed as to how we pray.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's a very easy thing to say, "Let us pray."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But the Bible, in the accounts which it gives us of prayers and of the whole method of prayer,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   makes it perfectly clear that we need instruction.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Lest we indulge in mere vain repetitions and lest we fail to pray with the understanding as well as with the heart.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And so you will always find that in these recorded prayers in the Bible,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   there is always a scheme, there is a system.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The prayers do not just ramble on from point to point without any sequence or any connection.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   There is a definite arrangement and order.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And as these prayers so prove to be effectual and efficacious,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   surely there is nothing better for us than to study them and to follow them and to emulate their example.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Well now, here I say we have a great and a typical prayer offered by the church in a period of declension.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   It is a great prayer, if you like, for revival.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   A prayer to God to look down from heaven and to visit his people once more.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Well now then, let us follow the method of the prophet. What does he do?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   We observe that the first thing he does is that he reminds himself of the character of God.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And he not only reminds himself of that, he reminds God of that.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now that is the great burden of the seventh verse.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I will mention, he says, the lovingkindnesses of the Lord and the praises of the Lord,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now that is a great and a comprehensive statement.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   He is starting, as I say, with the character of God.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And that is ultimately the secret of all true prayer.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Prayer must always begin by a realization of God and of his character.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Otherwise prayer can be a mere attempt at discovering some kind of psychological relief or ease.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Prayer can be the mere uttering up of pious hopes and aspirations, the mere expression of our fears.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   If prayer is to be real, surely the first thing we have to do is to realize the one to whom we are speaking.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I think that is obvious in every walk and in every department of life.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   To have an intelligent conversation, you must know something about the one to whom you are speaking.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   You must know something about their background, about their knowledge, the things they are interested in.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Well, it is exactly the same in prayer. Prayer is personal communion with the living God.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And there is nothing more important than that we should remind ourselves of God's glorious character.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And the prophet does that.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And the thing to notice, of course, is the way in which he uses the plurals.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Loving-kindnesses, praises, he says, great goodness, mercies, multitude of his loving-kindnesses.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   He does not put these things in the singular, but in the plural.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And you notice that he repeats the loving-kindnesses.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And his object in doing that, of course, is to remind himself of the abundance of these characteristics in God.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   God is one who is full of loving-kindness, full of compassion, full of goodness, full of mercies.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The multitude of his loving-kindness.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   How good is God? That is what he is reminding himself of.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And, of course, you can see the value of doing this, especially in the circumstances in which the prophet was praying.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   The need was desperate.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   They seemed to have been abandoned.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Many of them were given to grumbling and to complaining.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So the prophet realizes that the first thing he has got to do is to be perfectly certain about God.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   As if to say, whatever the explanation is of our present state and condition, it is not God.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   God, he says, I know to be full of these loving-kindnesses and goodness and mercies and compassions and praises.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And you and I must ever learn to pray in this way, whether it is an individual prayer or whether it is a prayer on behalf of the church.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   If we go into the presence of God with any doubt in our minds as to his goodness, there is very little point or purpose in our praying.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   When the devil comes and suggests that God is against us and that God does not care and so on,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   well, I say the first thing to do is to clear our minds.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   To get rid of any doubt or uncertainty about the being and the character of God.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Well, you remember how the apostle Paul puts it. He says, "In nothing be anxious."
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Well, how are you to avoid this anxious care and burdened anxiety?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He says, "In nothing be anxious, but in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving, thanksgiving,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   let our requests be made known unto God."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   You may find yourself in very trying circumstances this morning.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Everything may seem to be against you.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And you're beginning to wonder and to doubt, perhaps, whether God is really concerned about you,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   and you're beginning to query and to question his promises.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The first thing, my dear friend, you have to do is to get your mind and your thinking clear and straight.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   If there is any such lingering doubt in your mind or your heart about the character of God, I say your prayer is already useless.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Start with the prophet.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "I will make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the Lord."
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   God is good to all, and his tender mercy is over all.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   That is God's character, and it is eternal, and it is unchangeable.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   He is everlastingly a God of lovingkindnesses, of mercies, of goodness, and compassion.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And as he starts with the lovingkindnesses, you notice that he repeats it at the end of the statement,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses."
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Whatever may be the explanation of your individual condition or of the state of the church in general at the present hour,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   it is not to be found in any lack of lovingkindnesses or mercy or compassion in God, our Heavenly Father.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Well, now that is, I say, the point at which the prophet starts.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And if we are not clear about this, I say, there is no point in proceeding.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   If you have any criticism in your mind or your heart about God, stop praying.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's an insult.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   If you feel that God is against you and unfair to you, stop praying, I say.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   There is no purpose in your going on another sentence.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   We start by worshiping God, by adoring him, by praising him, by ascribing unto him,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   not only all might and majesty and dominion and power,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   but all the excellences of his holy nature that he has been so graciously pleased to reveal to us.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   That must ever be, I say, our starting point.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   But then you notice that having done that, the prophet proceeds to do something else.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And this is the thing which he elaborates and therefore which we must consider in detail.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Having reminded himself thus of the character of God,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   he makes a review of the history of the children of Israel.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And he does that at great length down indeed to the end of verse 14.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That is what he does from verse 8 to verse 14.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He looks back upon the history of the children of Israel.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Now, here is something that I am most anxious to emphasize in connection with his method.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Because it is such a common method, you will find in the scriptures.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You get it in all these prophets, you get it likewise in the book of Psalms.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   The psalmist finds himself again in difficulties, or he finds the church as she then was,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   the nation of Israel, in trouble, surrounded by enemies, perhaps defeated.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And this is the invariable thing which they do.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   They look back to the past.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   As if to say to themselves, well now then, why are we in this position?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   How have we ever come to this? Has this ever happened before?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And obviously, to do this is the very essence of wisdom.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Let me put it to you in this form.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   What we are dealing with here is not something theoretical.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   This is essentially historical.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   When we talk about praying to God and the benefits of prayer,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   we are not in the realm of mere academic knowledge,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   or something, as I say, which is purely theoretical.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   We are dealing with the dealings of God with his people.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   God's dealings with us today.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Yes, but we are reminded that we are not the first people to be in this world.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   We are not the only people to find ourselves in difficulties.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Fortunately, we have this long record,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   the history of God's dealing with his people in past ages and centuries,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   going right away back to the beginning and the origin of the human race.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And there is nothing, surely, that is of more priceless value to us,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and to the Church in general, than to be familiar with this very history.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   God doesn't merely give us teaching, he gives us history.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He says what he is going to do with his people and for them,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   but he has not only done that, he has given us a record of what he has done.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And this, I say, is invaluable for the Church.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Now the prophet, therefore, begins to look back and he says,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   "Well now, what is the relationship of Israel to God?"
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Let me go back to the very origin, to the beginning of this story.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And you and I must learn to do exactly the same thing,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   take the way in which the apostle Paul puts this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He says, referring to the history of the children of Israel in 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   he says, "These things are written for our ensample,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   upon whom the ends of the world have come."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   He says, "Why have we got the history of the children of Israel in the wilderness,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   and what happened to them, and all the rest of it?"
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Well, he says, "The purpose is this, that all this has been written for our example,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   for our help, for our aid.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That's how God dealt with them. Let us learn the lesson.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   God is still the same, and the principles of his dealings with mankind never vary.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   These things are written for our examples,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   upon whom the ends of the world have come."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And you and I are looking at this paragraph this morning for precisely that reason.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But we can supplement this.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   We can not only go back to the Bible and look at the principles there enunciated
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   of God's dealings with his people,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   but we can go back and look at the whole history of the Christian church,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   which brings the position much more nearly to our contemporary position.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And this is surely one of the first lessons that the church needs to learn at this present time.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   The trouble is, of course, that we are so obsessed with ourselves and with the twentieth century
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   that we fail to learn the lessons of history.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And yet they are there for us in great abundance and profusion.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It's an odd thing to say perhaps, but to me it's a great comfort that the church of God
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   has many a time in the past been in the same sort of condition in which he is today.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And it is the people who forget that who are most depressed at the present time.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I mean the people, you see, who are always talking about our difficulties,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   about the wireless and the television and communism.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   They say, "Here's the problem," as if nobody had ever had a problem before.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Now the antidote to all that is to go back into the history of the church.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   There is nothing new about the present position.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   The only thing that appears to be new is the particular form in which the difficulty presents itself.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But many and many a time the church has been down in the depths at the bottom of the trough,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and everybody was beginning to think that the end was at hand.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well now then, I say, go back and let us study the history.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Let us follow this man as he does so.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And here he begins, "For he said, 'Surely they are my people, children that will not lie.'
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   So he was their savior."
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Well, he's reviewing the history of God's dealings with his own people, the children of Israel.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And what he sees above everything else is God's goodness to the people.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   He sees it in this, that it was God who called them.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   He said, God said, "Surely they are my people."
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Well, how did they ever become his people?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Well, because he made them his people.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   The nation of Israel came into being through God calling a man whose name was Abram.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And he turned his name into Abraham.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   It was God's action.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It was God who called him out of the Caldeans.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It was God who took him to the promised land.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It was the action of God, the calling of the people.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   They are my people.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now that is the fundamental thing, says the prophet, which we must grasp.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   We are not like the other nations of the world.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   We are in a special and in a peculiar relationship to God.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We are his people.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And therefore, because he has called them and has started this work in them, he is their savior.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   That is the pronouncement.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   This word "so" should not be here.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   He said, "Surely they are my people."
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Children that will not lie, he was their savior.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Not because they didn't lie.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   They did lie.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   But because he has called them, he is going to save them.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   They are his people.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He has separated them unto himself and they belong to him in this peculiar and extraordinary manner.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, now here is the first thing we have to realize about the Church.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   The Church of God is not a human institution.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   She is not one among a number of institutions and societies,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   any more than Israel was just one among a number of nations in the ancient world.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Oh, no.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   She is his new creation by water and the world.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   The Church is the people of God.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   The whole of the origin of the Church is the result of God's purpose.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   It is God who has made her and created her.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It is he who calls us out of darkness into his most marvelous light.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   We have no being, we have no existence apart from our relationship to God.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And then he goes on to remind himself and the people of God's dealings with them.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   In all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   In his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bared them and carried them all the days of old.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   You see what he is doing.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   He says, here are we, the children of Israel.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   The Chaldeans have come and have conquered our city, have ruined it, carried us away captive.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Well, who are we?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Well, we are these people of God to whom God did these extraordinary and marvelous and wonderful things.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   I'll remind myself, he says, of the origin and of the beginning.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Now, we must be careful about the exact translation here.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I read, in all their affliction he was afflicted.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's generally agreed that that is not a good translation.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It would be better to put it like this.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   In all their adversity he was no adversary.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Or if you prefer, in all their enmity he was not an enemy.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   They were very often his enemies, he was never their enemy.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's the glorious thing which he can say.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   In all the enmity that they experienced from other people, he was not an enemy.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Now, you simply have to read the story of the children of Israel to confirm this for yourselves.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   There they are in affliction, in adversity, but God was never their adversary, God was never their enemy.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   There were others, they were their own enemies, he wasn't.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And the angel of his presence saved them.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Go back and read the story of the angel of the covenant who came and visited them and helped them.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   That's the angel of God's presence.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   That is undoubtedly a prefiguring of the Lord Jesus Christ himself,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   if indeed it wasn't the Lord Jesus Christ himself actually appearing in that particular form.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And then this most tender statement,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   "And he bare them and carried them all the days of old."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That was literally true.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And you see the value of reminding ourselves of this kind of thing.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Well, we are here like this now, says the prophet.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   But, oh, I think of the days, I go back to the times when God was carrying his people.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Like an eagle carries her young upon her wings, so God carried his people.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Carried them through the wilderness, carried them in the desert,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   carried them through the sea, carried them across the river.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   This is how God dealt with the people in times past.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   The goodness of God to his people.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And as the Christian church looks back to her origin,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   she sees exactly the same thing.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Go back to the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Look at that handful of people with nothing to recommend them at all.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Why are they there at all?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Why do you call them the church?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Well, it was the Lord who chose them.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He called them.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   He set them in this position.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He left his word with them.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   But look at them.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Just a little handful of people with the whole world against them.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   The Jews against them.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   The leaders, the authorities, the Gentiles against them.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The whole world was against them and yet look how God blessed them.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Look how God carried them.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Look at his tender dealings with them.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Look at the angel of his presence, the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And see that little church, that helpless, defenseless bend of people.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   See them triumphing, prevailing, conquering, going forward.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   God leading them on and giving them mighty victories.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   In his love and in his pity, see God carrying them along.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And follow the history of the Christian church throughout the centuries
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   and you'll find exactly the same thing.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Doesn't the early history of the Protestant Reformation seem almost impossible?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   What can one man like Martin Luther do with all that was against him?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   What can these little bends of people conceivably achieve
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   with so mighty opponents standing over and against them?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But God carried them along.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And that is what happens in all the great periods of revival that the church has ever known.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   God carried them all the days of old.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Now there is nothing that I know of that is so thrilling as to go back to these histories, to these stories.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And to see the church as she is being carried along by God,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   thrilled with the power and the might of his great authority and his great goodness.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   There is the origin, there is the beginning.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   But what happened to it?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Was the history of Israel always a history of blessing
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and of being carried along by God's goodness?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Well, no, says the man. And this was his comfort, you see.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   What happened? Well, this is what happened.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Now here again is something that you find recurring
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   as an almost endless theme in the writings of the Old Testament.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   This curious alternation in the history of the children of Israel.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   There they were at the beginning, but then you find them utterly downcast and almost destroyed.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   What was the matter? Well, it's always the same.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It was because these children of Israel, who'd been so called and so greatly blessed,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   rebelled against God and vexed and grieved his Holy Spirit.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Though they were these special people of God,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   though they were in this unique relationship to him,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   though they'd experienced these abundant blessings,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   this is what we find.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   They began to feel envious of the other nations and their gods.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   They began to feel that the religion of the God of Israel was too narrow.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   These Ten Commandments, they said.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   We're not allowed to eat what we like, we can't marry whom we like,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   we can't live seven days a week as we like.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   They rebelled against God.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   They said this religion is intolerable, this yoke is something that we can't bear.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   They rebelled against him, and they turned to other gods,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and they sinned against the God of Israel.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Though he had revealed himself to them,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and had given his holy law in utter detail so that there was no doubt about it,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   they rejected it all, turned their backs upon him,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   plunged into sin, imitated the other nations,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   took up their gods and their idols, and bowed before them and worshipped them.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   That was their story.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   In spite of all that God had been to them and had done for them,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   they thus deliberately rebelled against him and grieved and vexed his Holy Spirit.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Read their story.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   It's here for us.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   It's been recorded for our example.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   The children of Israel would have continued in a state of blessing
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   if they had not rebelled, if they had not vexed and grieved the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And when you see them down, that's always the explanation.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   They rebelled against God in belief and in the matter of practice.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And here, my friends, we come to the very nerve of our present position.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Why is the Christian Church as she is today?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Why is it the case that only 10% of the people of this country
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   claim even a nominal relationship to Christianity
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   and only half of those do so with any regularity and constancy?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Why are the places of worship in this land as they are today,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   in contrast with what they were, say, a hundred years ago?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Think of a hundred years ago.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   This very building was built in 1864 and of this size.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Why? Well, because the previous one, which was a large building, was not big enough.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And at the same time, Mr. Spurgeon was attracting those thousands south of the Thames.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   All places of worship in London were crammed full, and it was the same throughout the country.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   God was blessing.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   There was that great revival in 1859 affecting parts of the country.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   But before that, and in addition to that, God had been blessing the people.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   The great blessings of the revival of the 18th century were still continuing.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And religion was flourishing, and the Church was in a dominant position.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Even the statesmen had to pay attention to her.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   They talked about the nonconformist conscience and the nonconformist vote,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   and they had to pay attention to what the Church said.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   The Church was flourishing, rejoicing in the blessings of God.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Why are things so different today?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   That's the question.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   That is exactly the question you see confronting us.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   The same question in principle as that confronting this prophet.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Why are we down? Why are we being carried away to Babylon?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   What's gone wrong?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   How does it come to pass that this people, who were so great and so blessed, has come down to this?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It's the same question.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And alas, unfortunately, the answer is still the same.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   When Israel, when the Church is in trouble and is desolate and forsaken,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   it is always because of her own rebellion,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   her own grieving of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   That is the only explanation.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   But they rebelled and vexed His Holy Spirit.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And as the children of Israel did that, so the Church of God has done that in the last hundred years.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   This is the only explanation.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You notice that the prophet doesn't say that the trouble with Israel was that these enemies had come and attacked.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   No, no, that isn't the explanation.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   That had happened, of course, but that isn't the explanation.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Go through this prophet, go through all the other prophets in the Psalms,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and you will find that they always say this and this alone.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Whenever Israel is down and defeated, it is never because of the strength and the power of the enemy.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Oh no, because if they were right with God, it doesn't matter what the enemy is, nor ever powerful,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   God will always make them victorious.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   That's never the explanation.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Whenever Israel is defeated and is down,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   it is always and invariably because of her own rebellion,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   her own folly,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   her own vexing and grieving of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And alas, my friends, that is the diagnosis today.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Whether we like it or not, that is the real explanation.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   It isn't because of these new enemies that have arisen against the Church.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   They're always there.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It isn't communism, you know.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   It isn't the two world wars.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   It isn't the competition of the wireless and the television and the cinema.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   No, no, there has always been the opposition to the people of God.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   These things are not variables.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   These things are constants.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Well, what has happened, you say?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Well, what has happened is this,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   that the Church herself, in her own utterable folly,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   has rebelled against God and grieved and vexed His Holy Spirit.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   How? Well, in exactly the same way as Israel did,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   in belief and in practice.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   The children of Israel turned from God and His revelation.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   They turned to other gods and to their own notions and ideas.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   They deliberately set God on one side and made their own gods.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And that is precisely what the Church has done in the last hundred years.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   There is only one true explanation of the state of Christendom
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and the state of the Church today.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It is that the Church herself, last century,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   deliberately rejected God's revelation and put philosophy in its place.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   It was the Church that did it, not the common people.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The Church in her own leaders began to criticize this book,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   to set themselves up as authorities,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   to deny certain aspects of the teaching.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   They deny the God of the Old Testament.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   They don't believe in Him, they say.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   They made a mere man out of the Lord of Glory.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   They denied His virgin birth.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   They denied His miracles.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   They denied His atonement.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   They denied the person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And they reduced this to a book of ethics and of morals.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   That is why the Church is as she is.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The Church rebelled in her doctrine and in her belief.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   She set up the wisdom of men in the place of the wisdom of God.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   She became proud of her learning and of her knowledge.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And what she asked about her preachers and her servants was not any longer,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   "Is he filled with the Spirit?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Has he a living experience of God?
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   But is he cultivated?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Is he cultured?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   What are his degrees?"
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   No, I am not romancing, am I?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   This is literal history.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   The Church herself rebelled against God and vexed and grieved His Holy Spirit.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And man substituted his own notions and ideas for God's revelation and God's teaching.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It is an exact repetition of what the children of Israel did.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And, of course, it was not only done in belief and in teaching.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   It was done also in practice and in conduct and in behavior.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   People began to feel that the old evangelical way of living was too narrow.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   That was the word "narrowness."
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   And they wanted a broader kind of outlook and a broader kind of life.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And so, in belief and in practice,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   they turned their backs upon God and lived according to their own devices.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And the enemy came in, of course.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   The Church as a mere organization can never compete with the world.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   She is beaten at the very beginning.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Oh, it was pathetic to see how the Church tried to do it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   She tried to bring in things from the world.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   She introduced dramatics and this and that and the other, but it hasn't worked.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Of course not.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The Church can't do things like that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   It's the world that can do things like that and so much better.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   The Church has only one source of strength,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and that is the power of God,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   the power of His Holy Spirit.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And when she turns against that and rebels against it,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   she invariably finds herself defeated.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And this is what happens, of course.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Because she did that, God punished her.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   They rebelled and vexed His Holy Spirit.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Therefore, He was turned to be their enemy and He fought against them.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And we must be perfectly clear about this.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   This is literally true.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I said at the beginning that God's character is unchangeable.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Yes, that's absolutely true.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And this is unchangeable and also absolutely true.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   God told these children of Israel before He took them into the Promised Land.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   He said, "If you'll obey Me, I'll bless you."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Mount Gerizim.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   He said, "On the other hand, if you disobey Me, cursing I will curse you."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Mount Ebal.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   He told them He'd do it and He did it.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   He said, "If you don't obey My laws, if you don't walk in unison with Me,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   I will curse you."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And He cursed them, though they were His own people.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   In other words, having rebelled against Him,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   these people began to discover that they were fighting against God
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and that God not only did not bless them, but He fought against them.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   There are endless examples of that in the Old Testament history.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Who was it that raised up this Chaldean army to destroy Jerusalem?
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   The Bible says it was God who did it.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   He raised up an enemy to chastise His own people.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   He temporarily, metaphorically, became their enemies in order to reduce them
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   and in order to subdue them.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He did it repeatedly in this long Old Testament story.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And I have no hesitation in asserting
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   that He has done the same thing many and many a time
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   If the church, in her cleverness, rebels against Him and vexes His Spirit
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and turns her back upon Him, she must not assume
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   that she is just going to be left to herself.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   No, no, God will raise enemies and He will attack her.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   He will become an enemy to her.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   He will scourge her.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   He will humble her.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And I have no hesitation in asserting
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   that we are witnessing that very thing today.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   The church is still not humbled.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   She still does not realize that she is the cause of her own troubles.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   She does not realize that it is her rebellion that has done it.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Is there any evidence of repentance
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   for all this devastating higher critical movement of a century ago?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Have they gone back on that? Have they admitted it?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   No, no, they are still holding on to their results,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   though they see that it does not work and are trying to add other things to it.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   There is no repentance.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And so God raises enemies against the church.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   He has always done it and He will continue to do it.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And that is what He did, but thank God that is not the end of the story.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   What happened?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "Well," says the prophet,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   "then He," the nation of Israel,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   "remembered the days of old,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Moses and his people saying,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   'Where is He that brought them up out of the sea
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   with the shepherd of His flock?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Where is He that put His Holy Spirit within them,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   that led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm?'"
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   etc.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   What does it mean? Well, it is this.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   When God had chastised His people,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   had thus raised up enemies against them to humble them and to subdue them,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   in their utter defeat and hopelessness and despair,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   they suddenly came to themselves
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   and remembered Moses and the days of old and the origin of their being.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Now there is a perfect counterpart to that in the New Testament.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I just mention it because it puts the whole picture.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   It is the prodigal son again, you see,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   who walks away from home despising his father with his pockets full of money.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He knows what he is going to do so much better than his father.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Off he goes, ah yes, and he kept on and on and on
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   until he found himself sitting in that field with the husks and the swine.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   And suddenly he came to himself and said,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   "What am I doing here? I am my father's son."
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He thought of home. He thought of his father.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Yes, but it took that to make him think of his father.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   He had to be in rags, disheveled, empty, stomach empty, starving, dying
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   before he came to himself.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   But then he remembered, and he got up, and he went back, and he went home.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   My dear friends, that is what has always happened to the church
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   before she begins to experience revival.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   She has to come to herself and remind herself as to who she is and what she is.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   That she is the people of the living God brought into being in this miraculous manner
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   and that she belongs to God.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   She comes to herself.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And then she repents and begins to speak and to pray.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And oh, what a wonderful prayer this is.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   He remembered the days of old Moses and his people saying,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   "Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Where is he that put his Holy Spirit within him?"
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   That is the phrase.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Where is he?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Where is the God that called Moses that afternoon when he was a shepherd
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   on the backside of that mountain?
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Where is he?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Where is the God of Moses?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Where is the God of David?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Where is the God of Elijah?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Where is he, the God who does such marvelous things?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Where is he that we should be like this?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   That was their prayer.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   They turned back and they saw God confessing their sins.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   They said, "He is still the same God, but where is he?"
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   We know he is there, but where is he?
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Why are we like this?
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Let me repeat to you the particular petitions that they offered.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Where is he that put his Holy Spirit within him,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   dividing the water before him to make himself an everlasting name,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   that led them through the deep as on a horse in the wilderness
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   that they should not stumble as a beast goes down into the valley,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   So didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name."
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Oh, they said, "Where is this God of power?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Where is this God of deliverance?
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Where is this God with such teaching?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Where is the God who leads and guides?
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Where is the God who gives us rest?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Where is the God of glory?
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   That's his nature, that's what he did."
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Where is he?
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   We know that his power is still the same.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   We know that he can still give rest and glory to the church.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   We know that he can scatter every enemy,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   that he can divide the sea and divide the river,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   that he can give manna in the wilderness,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   that there is nothing impossible with him.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   There he is, and here are we, desolate and forsaken.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Where is he?
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   The God who, when he arises,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   can scatter all the modern enemies as he scattered the ancient enemies,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and dismiss them with the breath of his mouth.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Where is he?
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Beloved people, that is the prayer of the church.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   That is the only way of salvation.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   We look at our enemies, and in our folly we say, "What can we do?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   What fresh organization can we set up?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   What can we organize?
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   What can we do?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   We here and there."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   No, no, says this man.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   When these people of old came to themselves,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   I find that this is what they did.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   They said, "Where is he?"
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Oh, that I knew where I might find him.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   If only we could find him.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Where is he?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   He's there.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   He's somewhere with all his illimitable power.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   But the question is, where is he?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   So they set themselves to seek the Lord,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   and to seek his face.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   "Now," says the prophet, "that is what we must do."
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And so, you see, he begins to do it in verse 15, and he continues.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   God willing, we shall go on to consider that.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   He begins by praying, "Look down from heaven upon us.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   This God, he's there.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Where is he?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Well, let us seek him.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Let's drop everything else.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Let's concentrate on finding God, seeking his face.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Let us be urgent.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Where is he?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   The God of Moses.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   The God that filled them with his Spirit,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   that led them, that conquered their enemies,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   divided the sea, and led them into the promised land.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Nothing matters but that we should find him."
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   "Yes," said the prodigal, "I will arise and go to my Father,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   and I will say unto him,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thy face,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Make me as one of thy hired servants.'"
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   That's the prayer.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   In utter humility,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   seeing our rebellion and our folly,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   our foolish pride and our shame,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   let us arise and go to our Father saying,
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   "Where is he?"
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   For the moment we find him,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   we shall find that he's still full of lovingkindnesses and mercies
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   and compassion and love and mercy and all we need.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And his power is undiminished.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   And when he looks upon us and blesses us,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   again we shall become his people,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   and our enemies shall be scattered,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   and Zion shall again be filled with the glory of the Lord.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   "Where is he?"
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Is that the cry of your heart?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   I see no hope for the church
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   until her people are filled with this cry.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   "Where is he?"
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Nothing matters but to know him
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   and to be in the right relationship to him.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Amen.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
