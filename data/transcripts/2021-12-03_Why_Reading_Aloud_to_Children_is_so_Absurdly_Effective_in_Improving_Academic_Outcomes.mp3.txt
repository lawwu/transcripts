[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Earlier today, I recorded and released a podcast wherein I discussed why I believe helping
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.700]   your child to become a good reader by reading aloud when your child is young and also by
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.460]   surrounding your child with high-quality books and inspiring him as well as requiring him
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.000]   to read those books is perhaps your simplest, most effective investment into the education
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.120]   of your particular child and how it's easy, but not easy, to actually do it, and yet it's
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.840]   incredibly effective. I talked at length, I gave some examples of book lists, etc. After
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.060]   that show, I went back and I opened up my copy of Jim Trulisa's book that I referenced
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.300]   several times in that show called The Read Aloud Handbook, and I was just struck by how
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.100]   good it is, how much cogent, useful information it contains, and how well-presented some of
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.080]   the arguments are. And after looking through it, I felt like I didn't do the topic of reading
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.680]   aloud justice. This is something that I have talked about. I've repeatedly said that perhaps
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.320]   one of the best things that you can do for your children is to give your children the
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.840]   gift of a full-time mother, especially when your child is young, and that there's so much
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.640]   that can be done that will pay off in spades down the road. But I haven't presented a lot
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.280]   of the evidence for that. And looking through Trulisa's book, I just noticed how wonderful
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   it is.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.700]   And so what I'd like to do in this particular episode is I'd like to unhurriedly read you
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.440]   a few excerpts from this really wonderful book and present to you a couple of the very
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.280]   simple arguments and especially a couple of the numerical calculations and some of the
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.620]   research associated with those calculations as to why something as simple as reading aloud
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.080]   extensively to your children makes such a difference in all of their academic achievements
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.040]   and how then their academic achievements, of course, influence their entire life course.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.600]   And so I want to read some excerpts from the introduction and chapter one of this book
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.100]   called The Read Aloud Handbook by Jim Trulisa. Again, this book has been on the market for
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.060]   several decades. Jim is now retired and the book is now being updated by other persons.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.900]   But these arguments are really profoundly valuable. And what you'll see is that in
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.780]   many ways, if you're looking for something that even could be the great equalizer in
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.360]   society, one of the most powerful ways to eliminate the wealth gap or the achievement
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.100]   gap among classes, among races, etc., then this particular line of thinking and these
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.580]   particular actions are some of the best things that can be done to make progress in that
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.580]   direction.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.780]   So I want to begin by reading some excerpts from the introduction to help you. I always
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.220]   try to be cautious because sometimes I abuse the author's copyright just a little. But
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.880]   when I do that, I do it in hopes of inspiring you to consume the author's work by presenting
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.800]   it in a way that is really powerful and useful to you. And so I'll do my best to read excerpts,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.060]   but also I want to inspire you to take action on it. And I think that an author like Jim
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.660]   Trulise would be quite complimented most of all by your simply taking action on his recommendations.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.260]   And I want to inspire you to go ahead and grab a copy of the audio book, grab a copy
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.820]   of the written book yourself.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.500]   Introduction. The central task of education is to implant a will and facility for learning.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:36.140]   It should produce not learned, but learning people. The truly human society is a learning
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:45.800]   society where grandparents, parents, and children are students together. Quote by Eric Hofer.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.960]   In the 30 years since the first edition of this book, much has changed in the world and
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.460]   in American education. And so too, this book has evolved. Back in 1982, when the first
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.060]   edition appeared, there was no internet or email, no cell phones, DVD players, iTunes,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.340]   iPods, iPads, Amazon, eBooks, Wi-Fi, Facebook, or Twitter. The closest thing to an instant
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.300]   message was a facial expression that exasperated mothers gave their children as a warning.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.620]   Texting was something you did on a typewriter. The first CD player was just going on sale.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.140]   Starbucks was just a coffee bean shop in Seattle. And if you said laptop to people, they'd
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.620]   have thought you were talking about a TV dinner tray. For all of those differences, there
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.280]   are some things that remain the same. In 1982, the US economy was in its worst recession
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.260]   since the Great Depression, and the nation's business leaders were looking for someone
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:43.020]   or something to blame. Sound familiar? Since SAT scores had been in a 20-year decline because
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.700]   lots of average and below average students, and not just the rich kids, were taking the
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.420]   test for the first time, the corporate executives blamed education as one of the culprits for
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:59.620]   the recession and demanded reforms and accountabilities at all levels, a more business-like approach.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.860]   If our schools were more like Japanese schools, our economy would be more like theirs. This
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.340]   would open the door to nearly three decades of testing mania and school reforms. At practically
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.420]   the same time, the cost of college began a 400% rise, outpacing the increases in medical
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.380]   care and median family income. By 2011, student loans would be larger than either the nation's
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.860]   credit card debt or the auto loan industry. Which brings us to the present time. With
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.300]   all the new technology in place and billions of dollars in testing accomplished, we made
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:47.260]   a one-point improvement in reading scores between 1971 and 2008.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.860]   If you're even half sane, you have to be asking yourself, "What in the world is wrong
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.580]   here?" I hope this book can answer that question, as well as what we can do about
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.460]   it, because surely there's a better way than what we've done in the past. For all
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:08.020]   that is wrong in education, there are still some positives. With the hundreds of distractions
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.260]   imposed on American children in the past 30 years, 200 cable channels, most children with
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.060]   TVs in their bedrooms, usually the lowest scoring students, more than half of teens
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.380]   attached to cell phones most of the day, single parents raising one in four children, and
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.000]   a baby born every 60 seconds to a teen mother, it's a wonder the scores actually rose by
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.440]   one point and didn't drop by 10 or 15. If that is the case, then something must be working.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.380]   This book will examine what really works. In fact, let's look now at one of those
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.940]   some things. And by the way, I insert for context that my copy of this book is the 7th
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:53.660]   edition published in 2013. There has since been published an 8th edition, which I do
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.340]   not have nor have I read, but this was published or copywritten at least in 2013.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:06.900]   The ideal and cheapest tutoring plan. We start with the family of Susan and Tad Williams
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.540]   and their two sons, Christopher and David. Of the 400,000 students taking the ACT exam
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:20.140]   with Christopher back in 2002, only 57 had perfect scores. He was the 58th. When word
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:27.780]   got out that this kid from Russell, Kentucky, population 3,645, had scored a perfect 36,
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.540]   the family was besieged with questions, the most common being, "What prep course did
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.140]   he take? Kaplan? Princeton review?" It turned out to be a course his parents enrolled him
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:43.580]   in as an infant, a free program, unlike some of the private plans that now cost up to $250
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.100]   an hour. In responding to inquiries about Christopher's prep courses, the Williamses
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.020]   simply told people, including the New York Times, that he hadn't taken any, that he
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.980]   did no prep work. That, of course, wasn't completely true. His mother and father had
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:05.140]   been giving him and his younger brother free prep classes all through their childhoods,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:11.460]   from infancy into adolescence. They read to them for 30 minutes a night, year after year,
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.500]   even after they learned how to read for themselves. Theirs was a home brimming with books, but
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:23.500]   no TV guide, GameCube, or hooked on phonics. Even though Susan Williams was a fourth-generation
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:30.020]   teacher, she offered no home instruction in reading before the boys reached school age.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:36.660]   She and Tad just read to them, sewed the sounds and syllables and endings and blendings of
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.380]   language into the love of books. Each boy easily learned to read and loved reading,
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.600]   gobbling books up voraciously. Besides being a family bonding agent, reading aloud was
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:54.960]   used not as test prep, as much as an insurance policy. It ensured the boys would be ready
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.860]   for whatever came their way in school.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:03.920]   By 2011, David was a University of Louisville graduate working as an engineer, and Christopher
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:11.340]   was pursuing his PhD in biochemistry at Duke. Sometimes, Christopher's early reading experiences
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.300]   surface even in the biochemistry department, like when he remarked to his lunchmates the
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.400]   day after a Duke basketball loss, "Guess there's no joy in Mudville today." None
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.300]   of the other grad students grasped the reference to Ernest Tayer's classic sports poem.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.120]   The Williams family experience didn't surprise me at all, because I was already familiar
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.220]   with reading aloud as a prep course. Tom Parker recommends it all the time. He's the former
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.620]   admissions director for Williams College, now at Amherst College, two of the nation's
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.780]   prestigious small colleges. Parker tells anxious parents who ask about improving their child's
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.460]   SAT scores, "The best SAT preparation course in the world is to read to your children in
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.340]   bed when they're little. Eventually, if that's a wonderful experience for them,
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.960]   they'll start to read themselves." Parker told me he's never met a student with high
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:07.820]   verbal SAT scores who wasn't a passionate reader, and nearly always they recall being
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:15.320]   read to. An ACT or SAT prep course can't package that passion, but parents like Susan
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.780]   and Tad Williams have done it and so can you. Even parents who are illiterate or semi-literate
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.460]   can do it, and we'll meet them later in the book, along with a father who read to
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:33.740]   his daughter just for fun for 3,218 nights in a row, never missing a night. Never before
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.620]   in American history has so much been written about the subject of reading as in the past
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.500]   two decades. Never has so much money been spent to test children in any subject. And
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.660]   never have so many reading rules and regulations been imposed on schools by a succession of
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.620]   administrations with little or no improvements to show for it.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.300]   Strangely, the biggest impact seems to be on families that are the wealthiest and most
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:05.820]   educated. Where 40 years ago children were spending their after-school hours at ballet
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.940]   classes, scout meetings, or soccer practices, millennium moms and dads now have them enrolled
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:20.180]   in after-school tutoring. The suburban paranoia over state tests has ballooned the tutoring
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:28.460]   business into a $4 billion industry, and not just for school-age children. By 2005, Sylvan
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:36.620]   Learning was opening its 1,100 centers to 4-year-olds, while Kumon was accepting 2-year-olds.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:42.340]   Where once these centers were mainly for remediation, half the enrollments now come from families
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:46.580]   looking to give their child an advantage. Like the mother who told the Wall Street Journal
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.820]   she had enrolled her 4-year-old because his "scissors skills" were not up to par.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.860]   How about the parents, that's plural, who hire consultants to help their children make
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:03.740]   better eye contact and demonstrate leadership qualities with preschool directors while they're
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:09.620]   being considered for preschool admission? Just as they've hired life coaches for themselves,
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.780]   helicopter parents are hiring college counselors for their children, costing between $3,000
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.820]   and $6,000. The counselors are supposed to ensure the "right" school choices are
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:26.060]   made and that the paperwork is in order and on time. All of this provokes clinical psychologist
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.980]   Wendy Mogul to suggest these parents may someday be on the receiving end of a class-action
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.340]   suit from their children for stealing their childhoods.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.340]   Not that parents are alone in their extreme behavior. They have more than enough company
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:48.420]   among school boards and high-ranking politicians who think if you "fix" the schools, you'll
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:55.740]   "fix" the kids. So, in Gadsden, Alabama, school officials eliminated kindergarten nap
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:02.300]   time in 2003 so the children would have more test prep time. Two hours away in Atlanta,
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.500]   school officials figured that if you eliminate recess, the kids will study more. And just
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.740]   in case those shifty teachers try to sneak it in, Atlanta started building schools without
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.740]   playgrounds.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.900]   "We are intent on improving academic performance," said the superintendent. "You don't do
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.900]   that by having kids hanging on the monkey bars."
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.700]   Several years later, when it was apparent the anti-recess strategy wasn't driving
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.020]   up the scores, a new Atlanta superintendent created what state investigators called "a
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:40.660]   culture of fear and a conspiracy of silence" in pursuit of higher scores. Scores rose and
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:47.140]   bonuses were awarded. But a subsequent state investigation led to the largest standardized
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:54.500]   testing scandal in America, with more than 170 educators involved in the cheating, including
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.980]   38 principals.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.740]   In a New York Times online essay about the disappearance of recess in play, David Bornstein
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:10.780]   compared today's test-oriented curriculum with Dickens' novel Hard Times and its aptly
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:17.700]   named schoolmaster, Thomas Gradgrind. "On average, American kids get only 26 minutes
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.340]   of recess per day, including lunchtime. And low-income kids get less than that," Bornstein
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:31.820]   wrote. "High-scoring Finland has 15 minutes of recess for every 45-minute class. But more
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.340]   on Finland later."
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:38.600]   At the high school level, the new principal at one prestigious New England high school
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.100]   in Needham, Massachusetts, was so alarmed by the stress levels of his students he formed
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.940]   a committee to develop coping strategies. The end result was mandatory yoga classes
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:55.340]   for seniors. He also dared to end the publication of the school's honor roll in the local
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:01.540]   newspaper and pushed to lighten the homework load. Both issues provoked parental ire and
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.540]   within a year he'd accepted the principalship of the American School in London.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.600]   Nonetheless, four years later, the yoga classes were still in place as part of faculty efforts
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.420]   to build student resiliency. Homework was curtailed around holidays and notice of honor
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.200]   roll achievement now comes in a letter to the parents from the principal instead of
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   publicly via the local newspaper. Other select high schools have had to make lunch periods
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.620]   mandatory because so many students feel every period of the day must be filled with something
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:39.460]   that will reflect positively on their college application/resume and somehow lunch doesn't
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:44.660]   fit that bill. Where once it was only institutions like the University of Chicago that could
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:52.260]   be tagged as places where "fun comes to die," now we can apply the label to elite high schools.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.420]   College admission officers and counselors are feeling the stress as well, but for different
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.700]   reasons. At Harvard, the nation's oldest university and recipient of the largest number
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.980]   of advanced placement students, a 30-year veteran of the admissions office said today's
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:14.500]   students "seemed like dazed survivors of some bewildering lifelong boot camp" and
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.020]   warned that "unless things change, we're going to lose a lot of them." In our pursuit
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:29.780]   of higher and higher scores, he said "the fabric of family life has just been destroyed."
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.940]   Ultimately there must be a way to raise a reader and a capable student without creating
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:43.060]   a stressed-out, dazed survivor. Of course, for every parent who is pressing children's
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.980]   stress buttons, there is the other extreme, the ones who think the job of education is
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:53.200]   the responsibility of teachers. These parents far outnumber the pushy ones, and they create
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   another kind of problem. From this point on, it might be helpful if I arrange the discussion
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.460]   according to the kinds of questions I receive from parents and educators. For example, from
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:10.700]   the parent who is the complete opposite of helicoptering. Are you suggesting this reading
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:18.400]   stuff is the job of the parent? I thought it was the school's job.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.820]   This brings us to the sponge factor, exemplified by a young lady named Bianca Cotton, whom
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:30.940]   I met in 2002 on the morning my grandson Tyler began kindergarten. Families were invited
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.220]   in for the first hour to help break the ice, and I was snapping some pictures of Tyler
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.900]   and a new friend when I became aware of an extended conversation going on behind me in
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.600]   the little housekeeping section of the kindergarten. Turning around, I found Bianca cooking up
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.560]   a make-believe meal on a make-believe stove while carrying on a make-believe conversation
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.360]   on a make-believe cordless phone. And, as you can see in the photo I snapped, she had
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.320]   all the body language down for talking on the phone and cooking at the same time. Every
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.740]   child, kindergartner or otherwise, is like a sponge, soaking up the behavior of the people
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:15.360]   around them. If Bianca had never seen an adult talking on the phone while cooking, she'd
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:22.940]   never have thought to grab a phone while cooking her first kindergarten meal.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:28.320]   If Bianca isn't proof enough for you, consider this. Since 1956, no newspaper, network, or
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.440]   news agency has a better record for predicting the outcomes in presidential elections than
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:41.280]   Weekly Reader, the late national classroom magazine. Every four years for a half-century,
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:48.440]   a quarter million children voted in the Weekly Reader presidential poll. And in 13 of the
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.720]   14 campaigns, they were absolutely correct. Like little sponges, they sat in their parents'
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:00.800]   living rooms, kitchens, and cars, soaking up parental values and then squeezed them
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:07.080]   out onto a Weekly Reader ballot. It comes down to simple arithmetic. The child spends
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:16.280]   900 hours a year in school and 7,800 hours outside school. Which teacher has the bigger
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   influence? Where is more time available for change? Those two numbers, 900 and 7,800,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.360]   will appear over and over in this book.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.880]   Jay Matthews, the Washington Post's longtime education columnist, looked back on all the
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.480]   student achievement stories he'd done in 22 years and observed, "I cannot think of
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.600]   a single instance in which the improvement in achievement was not tied, at least in part,
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.120]   to an increase in the amount of time students had to learn." I've been saying the same
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.560]   thing for as many years. You either extend the school day, as have the successful KIPP
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.880]   charter schools, or you tap into the 7,800 hours at home. Since the cost of lengthening
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.460]   the school day would be prohibitive in the places that need it most, the most realistic
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:13.280]   option is tapping the 7,800 hours at home. Ronald F. Ferguson, a black scholar and Harvard
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.560]   lecturer, has long studied racial achievement gaps in public schools. Complicated as those
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.520]   issues are, Ferguson boils them down to one. "The real issue is historical differences
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:32.080]   in parenting. That is hard to talk about, but that is the root of the skill gap."
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   According to Ferguson, black households traditionally see schooling as a job for teachers, while
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.880]   white families are more involved in schooling the child or paying for special services.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.440]   Contrary to the current screed that blames teachers for just about everything wrong in
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.600]   schooling, research shows that the seeds of reading and school success (or failure) are
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.880]   sown in the home long before the child ever arrives at school. For example, 21 classes
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.100]   of kindergartners were examined to determine which children displayed either high or low
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.860]   interest in books. Those students' home environments were then examined in detail.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.840]   The numbers reinforce the adage that the apple doesn't fall from the tree. Therefore, if
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:24.440]   you want different apples, change the tree. I will not go over the numbers in the following
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:32.800]   chart other than to say that children with a high interest in books come from fathers
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.220]   and mothers with a high interest in books. Children with low interest in books come from
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:43.020]   fathers and mothers with a low interest in books. And you have enough of the introduction
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:50.480]   to get the flavor from it. I want to skip forward to a formula of reading success and
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.140]   then we're going to get into some data here. So the question is this, is reading still
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.760]   important in the video age? Reading is the heart of education. The knowledge of almost
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:06.860]   every subject in school flows from reading. One must be able to read the word problem
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:12.440]   in math to understand it. If you cannot read the science or social studies chapter, how
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.000]   do you answer the questions at the end of the chapter? Because reading is the linchpin
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.560]   of education, one can say it's a safety belt for a long life. When RAND researchers
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.680]   examined all the possible causes of long life expectancy, race, gender, geography, education,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:40.040]   marriage, diet, smoking, and even churchgoing, the biggest factor was education. Another
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:45.380]   researcher went back more than a hundred years to when states initiated compulsory education.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.400]   She found that for every year of education, the individual lived an average of one and
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   a half years longer. When her research was applied to other countries, the same pattern
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.800]   appeared. Similarly, today's Alzheimer's researchers have found what they consider
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   to be an immunizing effect from childhood reading and vocabulary buildup. And of course,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   these are all linked with supporting sources and studies and references.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.720]   All things considered, reading, not video, is the single most important social factor
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:23.600]   in American life. Here's a formula that may sound simplistic, but all of its parts
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:30.960]   have been documented and I would add are linked in the book or cited in the book. But all
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.840]   of its parts have been documented and while not 100% universal, it holds true far more
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   often than not. 1. The more you read, the more you know. Again, 1. The more you read,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   the more you know. 2. The more you know, the smarter you grow. Again, the more you know,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:08.040]   the smarter you grow. 3. The smarter you grow, the longer you stay in school. 4. The longer
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.120]   you stay in school, the more diplomas you earn and the longer you are employed. Thus,
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:21.440]   the more money you earn in a lifetime. 5. The more diplomas you earn, the higher your
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:30.000]   children's grades are in school and the longer you live. The opposite would also be
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.600]   true. 1. The less you read, the less you know. 2. The less you know, the sooner you drop
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:45.980]   out of school. 3. The sooner you drop out, the sooner and longer you are poor and the
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:52.480]   greater your chances of going to jail. The basis for that formula is firmly established
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:26:00.280]   as poverty and illiteracy are related. They are the parents of desperation and imprisonment.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:09.200]   70-82% of prison inmates are school dropouts. 60% of inmates are illiterate to semi-literate.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.480]   The more education, the greater likelihood of employment and less likelihood of imprisonment.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   Why are students failing and dropping out of school? Because they cannot read well enough
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.000]   to do the assigned work, which affects the entire report card. Change the reading scores
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.080]   and you change the graduation rate and then the prison population, which changes the social
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.840]   climate of America.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:40.000]   I hope you see how powerful that particular formula is. I want to emphasize it by simply
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.320]   reading it again and I want to tell you that again, all of this is cited. The more you
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.640]   read, the more you know. The more you know, the smarter you grow. The smarter you grow,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.080]   the longer you stay in school. The longer you stay in school, the more diplomas you
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.600]   earn and the longer you are employed. Thus, the more money you earn in a lifetime. The
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:04.720]   more diplomas you earn, the higher your children's grades are in school and the longer you live.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.640]   The opposite is also true. The less you read, the less you know. The less you know, the
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.360]   sooner you drop out of school. The sooner you drop out, the sooner and longer you're
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.600]   poor and the greater your chances of going to jail.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:22.440]   And just a short bit of personal commentary, I think that the important thing is to acknowledge
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:28.600]   that when you come to a financial return on investment, college has a very high return
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.040]   as I'll read in just a moment in a separate section. And there's no question about that.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:40.440]   That is proven again and again and again. It's not to say that all people who do not
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:47.240]   go to college are destined for failure, but going to college is highly correlated with
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:53.520]   significant levels of financial success. Let's hear what the author has to say on this topic.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.760]   "Considering today's economy and rising tuition costs, is college worth the money?"
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.360]   The economists at the Brookings Institution tackled that question and rephrased it to
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:08.520]   look like this. If you had $102,000 to spend on either a really good college education
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.600]   or to put into investments like stocks, bonds, gold, or housing, where would you get the
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   best return on your dollar? Considering the average lifetime earnings of a college graduate
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:23.920]   and the investment market for the past 60 years, the long-term return would play out
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.200]   like the following chart, which indicates that an associate's degree gets you in excess
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   of a 20% rate of return, internal rate of return. A bachelor's degree gets you a 15%
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.360]   internal rate of return, compared with the stock market that by their numbers is somewhere
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:46.280]   around looks like about 6.5 to 7. Gold at 2.5, long-term treasury at 2.5, and housing
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:53.240]   at 1%. Looks like an easy choice. College is double the return on anything else. The
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.880]   Great Recession took its toll on everyone, but least hurt were those with the most education.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.720]   Those with only a high school degree were twice as likely to be unemployed. And here
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:16.920]   I wish to interrupt Jim with an emphasis that right now in the recession related to the
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.240]   pandemic that we've been going through, I think you see very clearly the same exact
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.800]   trend. And while I don't have all the data at my fingertips to go over with you, nor
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:34.280]   would I do it, given this is an audio program, I want you just to notice that the most highly
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:43.440]   educated people throughout the markets have been able to maintain their productivity.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.640]   Most of the radical personal finance listening audience has not had any meaningful decline
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:56.840]   in income because we have not had any meaningful decline in productivity throughout the pandemic.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.680]   That's very different than the lesser educated people have faced given the significant decline,
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.600]   temporary decline in the job market related to the pandemic. And so you can see that we
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.040]   are living in an intensely knowledge-oriented society, and the most productive people are
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:24.440]   generally those who have the most formal education and who are able to continue their productivity
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.760]   and are in high demand no matter the market conditions. That's the economy in which we
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.680]   live. Continuing with the reading.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.720]   So if college is the best investment of time and money for the student, and the best way
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:42.880]   to succeed at college to be a proficient reader, then a parent's best financial investment
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:50.120]   is to spend the time and energy to raise a reader. If the child prefers not to attend
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:57.080]   college but is an avid reader, she will still make wiser decisions in her personal and business
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:05.320]   life and certainly be a better informed voter and juror, which benefits the entire community.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:14.520]   Overall, raising readers is a win-win situation. We just have to care enough to do it. Notice
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:20.860]   the chain. College is a good investment of time and money. The best way to succeed at
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.420]   college is to be a proficient reader because being a proficient reader is the mark of success
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.980]   in academics all the way up through college. So thus a parent's best financial investment
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.940]   is to spend the time and energy to raise a reader. And as I have commented on, this is
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.620]   actually quite simple. It doesn't cost a lot. You don't need to hide all our coaches.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.620]   You simply need to read to your children. So you have to invest into creating the appropriate
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:50.820]   home environment where you can have your children read to and then in time surround them with
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.540]   books.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:59.980]   Let's talk about why read aloud. One day back in the 1980s, I visited the kindergarten
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:05.220]   room I had attended years earlier as a child at Connecticut Farms Elementary School in
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:11.940]   Union, New Jersey. Gazing up at me were the faces of about 15 children, each of them seated
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:17.140]   expectantly on their story rug. "How many of you want to learn to read this year?"
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.440]   I asked. Without a second's hesitation, every hand shot into the air, many accompanied
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.880]   by boasts like, "I already know how!" Their excitement matched what every kindergarten
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.620]   teacher has told me. Every child begins school wanting to learn to read. In other words,
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:38.100]   we've got 100% enthusiasm and desire when they start school, the first chapter in their
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.860]   life. In subsequent years, when the National Reading Report Card surveyed students, they
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:49.020]   found very different attitudes and behaviors as the students aged. Among fourth graders,
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:55.300]   only 54% read something for pleasure every day. Among eighth graders, only 30% read for
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.540]   pleasure daily. By twelfth grade, only 19% read anything for pleasure daily. The Kaiser
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:09.420]   Family Foundation's 2010 Longitudinal Study of Children 8 to 18 years of age found 53%
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:18.460]   read no books in a given day, 65% read no magazines, and 77% no newspapers. In a Bureau
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:25.020]   of Labor Statistics survey in 2010, young adults between ages 15 and 19, the largest
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:33.720]   concentration of high school and college students, reported spending only 12 minutes a day reading
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:40.980]   versus 2.23 hours watching television. Think about it. We have 100% interest in kindergarten
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.300]   but lose three-quarters of our potential lifetime readers by the time they're 18. Any business
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:50.840]   that kept losing that much of its customer base would be out of business. Admittedly,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.300]   there is a natural fall-off during adolescence and early adulthood. These are the busiest
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.240]   social and emotional times of human life. But what if the early interest never returns?
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.940]   If schooling's objective is to create lifetime readers who continue to read and educate themselves
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:11.580]   after they graduate, and then they fail to do so, that's a major indictment of the
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:17.660]   process. Let's see how the childhood figures are reflected in adulthood these days. The
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.620]   National Endowment for the Arts surveyed adult reading habits for 25 years, and its most
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:29.660]   recent report coincided perfectly with the National Assessment of Educational Progress
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:37.280]   (NAEP) of pleasure reading among 13 and 17-year-olds. The number of adults who read literature was
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:44.540]   down 22% from its 1982 survey in every age, gender, ethnic, and educational category.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:52.380]   By 2002, only 46.7% had read any fiction in the previous year. When expanded in a different
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:56.660]   survey to include newspapers or any kind of book or magazine, the figure rose to only
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:05.760]   50% of adults. In short, half of America is alliterate.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.180]   As I showed in the introduction, reading scores improved by only 1 point for 17-year-olds
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:18.960]   and 5 points for 13-year-olds between 1971 and 2008. That's 37 years, half of it devoted
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:24.880]   to national and state curriculum reform. Couple those figures with mobile multimedia usage
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:31.820]   soaring to more than 7.5 hours a day for students ages 8 to 18, and one can see a perfect storm
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:37.700]   on the horizon, threatening to hinder reading even further.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.680]   But aren't kids reading when they're checking Facebook, checking tweets, or online? There
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.500]   is a school of thought that finds some hope in that theory. I don't attend that school.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:52.160]   Text messages are as close to reading as refrigerator magnets are, except the magnet messages are
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.680]   usually spelled better and have longer sentences. At last count, American teens are racking
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:05.920]   up 3,339 text messages a month and rising, or 6 per waking hour. If they're only absorbing
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.400]   130 to 160 characters at a time, there is little opportunity to improve reading or thinking
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.900]   skills. Since most of the subject matter is gossip, clothes, music, and entertainment,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.640]   there is not a lot of deep thinking taking place either, especially if your responses
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.760]   are instant. As for online reading, studies indicate only
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   18% of a webpage is actually read by the visitor, with the average page view lasting 10 seconds
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.600]   or less. It has always been true that a certain percent
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.040]   of students get through school without reading an entire book, in the old days and today.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.320]   Now teachers worry the numbers are rising, including at the college level. The one refrain
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:54.480]   I hear from professors, including those teaching future teachers, is this, "Only 25 to 30%
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.720]   of my students are avid readers. Few have voluntarily read a novel in the past year,
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.200]   and they can't name a favorite author or a favorite childhood book." One teacher
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.120]   at a top preparatory school explained how students pull it off, "They read the key
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.360]   parts of the text, or they go online, or they ask the kids who do the reading to tell them
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.220]   what happens, or they sit in class and listen to their teacher tell them what the reading
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.400]   is about and feed off that. Having no affection for reading, they slip through the class by
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:33.680]   gaming the system." Why no affection for reading? It was either never planted or driven
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:41.120]   out by seat work and test prep, leaving no room for a pleasure connection. None of this
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:47.500]   means we're a nation of illiterates. We're not. The average American student can read.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:53.040]   In fact, 60% of today's young people attempt advanced education compared with 20% in 1940.
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.360]   In other words, they're getting by. It's when they haven't read much and then enroll
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.380]   in college classes that the void is exposed. 74% of community college students never achieve
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.820]   a diploma, and 43% of students of four-year public colleges never graduate. Woody Allen
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.800]   may have been right when he said, "Showing up is 80% of life, but that doesn't include
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:23.720]   college diplomas. Those usually require more than just showing up." Why the diploma failure?
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.800]   Three-quarters of the incoming freshmen at New York State community colleges need remedial
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:34.040]   help in reading, writing, and/or math, putting a $33 million strain on the state's education
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:39.880]   budget. Most of these are high school graduates. More important, these are students from working
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:46.040]   class homes or lower, often among the first members of their families attempting college.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.440]   Worth noting is that students who experience the least success in classrooms at any level
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:57.600]   usually come from homes and schools with the worst print climate, the fewest books, magazines,
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.620]   newspapers, etc. It's difficult to get good at reading or even read much if there's nothing
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:08.820]   to read. So how do we fix the reading problem? We start by looking at the recommendation
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:14.120]   of the 1983 Commission on Reading, funded by the U.S. Department of Education, which
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:19.200]   was alarmed by school scores. Since nearly everything in the curriculum rested upon reading,
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.160]   the consensus was that reading was at the heart of either the problem or the solution.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.120]   The commission spent two years poring through thousands of research projects conducted in
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:36.840]   the previous quarter century and in 1985 issued its report, Becoming a Nation of Readers.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:44.800]   Among its primary findings, two simple declarations rang loud and clear. "The single most important
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:51.060]   activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:59.100]   aloud to children." Also, "It is a practice that should continue throughout the grades."
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.340]   The commission found conclusive evidence to support reading aloud not only in the home
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:09.820]   but also in the classroom. In their wording, "The single most important activity,"
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.940]   the experts were saying, "reading aloud was more important than worksheets, homework,
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:18.780]   book reports, and flashcards. One of the cheapest, simplest, and oldest tools of teaching was
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:24.180]   being promoted as a better tool than anything else in the home or classroom." And it's
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:29.100]   so simple you don't even need a high school diploma in order to do it. And how exactly
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:35.580]   does a person become proficient at reading? It's a simple two-part formula. One, the
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.260]   more you read, the better you get at it. The better you get at it, the more you like it,
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:45.140]   and the more you like it, the more you do it. Two, the more you read, the more you know,
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.860]   and the more you know, the smarter you grow. Let me repeat that. The more you read, the
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.380]   better you get at it. The better you get at it, the more you like it, and the more you
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.100]   like it, the more you do it. The more you read, the more you know, and the more you
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:02.180]   know, the smarter you grow. The vast majority of students know how to read by fourth grade.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:08.220]   In fact, by eighth grade, 24% are below basic level, 42% are at basic level, 25% are at
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.380]   proficient level, and only 3% are at advanced level. To improve from basic to proficient
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:19.860]   and then advanced, one must practice by reading a lot. This is identical to riding a bicycle.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.980]   The more you ride it, fall off, climb back on, and ride some more, the better you get
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.620]   at it. You learn to lean left when turning left, where to place your feet when coming
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:33.500]   to a stop, etc. This practice amounts to what Margaret Meek called "private lessons."
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.420]   The beginning of students' negative attitude toward reading appears to begin in fourth
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:44.180]   grade, when they must take the individual skills they have learned in the three previous
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:52.020]   years and apply them to whole paragraphs and pages. This juncture is famously called the
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:58.140]   fourth grade slump, a phrase coined from the research of the late Gene Chall. It's where
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:06.620]   school separates the readers from the strugglers and remedials. But, and this is a very loud
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:16.060]   but, if the way they have learned or been exposed to basic reading skills is so boring
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:22.340]   and joyless they hate it, they will never read outside their classroom. Since the bulk
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:28.180]   of their time, 7,800 hours a year, is spent outside school, these hours dictate whether
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:34.940]   they read often enough to become proficient or begin to fall behind. No reading outside
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:43.900]   school, low scores inside school. Reading to these students, preferably from infancy
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.260]   but certainly as they got older, in school and out of school, is what the Commission
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:57.520]   on Reading was begging the nation to do, to sow the seeds of reading desire. How can something
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:03.860]   as simple as reading to a child be so effective? As lumber is the primary support for building
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:12.720]   a house, words are the primary structure for learning. There are really only two efficient
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:24.300]   ways to get words into a person's brain, either by seeing them or by hearing them.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.940]   Since it will be years before an infant uses his or her eyes for actual reading, the best
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:37.580]   source for vocabulary and brain building becomes the ear. What we send into that ear becomes
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:46.060]   the foundation for the child's brain house. Those meaningful sounds in the ear now will
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:52.500]   help the child make sense of the words coming in through the eye later when learning to
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:59.340]   read. We read to children for all the same reasons we talk with children, to reassure,
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:08.660]   to entertain, to bond, to inform or explain, to arouse curiosity and to inspire. But in
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:16.340]   reading aloud, we also build vocabulary, condition the child's brain to associate reading with
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:24.660]   pleasure, create background knowledge, provide a reading role model, plant the desire to
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.180]   read. One factor hidden in the decline of students' recreational reading is that it
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:33.860]   coincides with the decline in the amount of time adults read to them. By middle school,
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:38.740]   almost no one is reading aloud to students. If each read aloud is a commercial for the
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:46.020]   pleasures of reading, then a decline in advertising would naturally be reflected in a decline
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:52.620]   in students' recreational reading. There are two basic reading facts of life that are
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:58.620]   ignored in most education circles. Yet, without these two principles working in tandem, little
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:09.660]   else will work. Reading fact number one, human beings are pleasure-centered. Reading fact
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:19.940]   number two, reading is an accrued skill. Let's examine fact number one. Human beings will
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:25.460]   voluntarily do over and over that which brings them pleasure. That is, we continually go
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.220]   to the restaurants we like, order the foods we like, listen to the radio stations that
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.900]   play the music we like, and visit the neighbors we like. Conversely, we avoid the foods, music,
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:41.560]   and neighbors we dislike. Far from being a theory, this is a physiological fact. We approach
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:49.740]   what causes pleasure and we withdraw from what causes displeasure or pain. When we read
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:55.300]   to a child, we're sending a pleasure message to the child's brain. You could even call
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:04.220]   it a commercial, conditioning the child to associate books and print with pleasure. There
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.100]   are, however, displeasures associated with reading in school. The learning experience
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:15.300]   can be tedious or boring, threatening, and often without meaning. Endless hours of worksheets,
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:21.300]   intensive phonics instructions, and unconnected test questions. If a child seldom experiences
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:27.020]   the pleasures of reading but increasingly meets its displeasures, then the natural reaction
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   will be withdrawal. That brings us to reading fact number two. Reading is like riding a
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:41.380]   bicycle, driving a car, or sewing. In order to get better at it, you must do it. And the
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:47.100]   more you read, the better you get at it. The past 30 years of reading research confirms
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:53.280]   this simple formula, regardless of gender, race, nationality, or socioeconomic background.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:03.500]   Students who read the most also read the best, achieve the most, and stay in school the longest.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:08.300]   Conversely, those who don't read much cannot get better at it. Why don't students read
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.420]   more? Because of reading fact number one. The large number of displeasure messages they
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.780]   received throughout their school years, coupled with the lack of pleasure messages in the
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:26.100]   home, nullify any attraction books might have. They avoid print the same way a cat avoids
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:34.060]   a hot stovetop. There is ample proof for all these hypotheses in my answer to the next
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:40.500]   question. Which country has the best readers? One of the most comprehensive international
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.460]   reading studies was conducted by Warwick Ely for the International Association for the
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:53.380]   Evaluation of Educational Achievement, IEA, in 1990 and 1991. Involving 32 countries,
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:48:01.220]   it assessed 210,000 9 and 14-year-olds. Of all those children, which ones read best?
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:09.700]   For 9-year-olds, the four top nations were Finland (569), the United States (547), Sweden
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:18.620]   (539), and France (531). But the U.S. position dropped to a tie for 8th when 14-year-olds
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:27.460]   were evaluated. This demonstrates that American children begin reading at a level that is
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:35.960]   among the best in the world. But since reading is an accrued skill, and U.S. children appear
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.380]   to do less of it as they grow older, their scores decline when compared with countries
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:48.100]   where children read more as they mature. We also have a higher proportion of children
[00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:55.940]   in poverty and their scores decline as they go through school. And while the racial gaps
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:02.420]   in education have narrowed in recent years, the achievement gap between rich and poor
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:11.340]   students has widened by an alarming 40% since the 1960s. When Sarah Ransdell, a professor
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:17.420]   at Nova Southeastern, a Florida research university, studied the reading comprehension of 270,000
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:22.220]   students at 259 schools in Broward County, Florida, she found poverty was the single
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:27.540]   largest common denominator among children who failed at reading. As you will see, these
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:33.900]   are children who are spoken to the least, who are seldom read to, who see the least
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:40.540]   print in school or at home, and who therefore struggle the most with reading.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.780]   To finish, children start reading classes sooner. Just the opposite. Finland's high
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:50.660]   scores should give pause to those who think an earlier reading start (hot housing) will
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:55.500]   produce better results. They're really not into baby Einstein toys over there. There
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.180]   was only a three-month difference in age between the first-place Finnish children and second-place
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:04.300]   American students. Yet the Finnish children, who are introduced to formal reading instruction
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:09.660]   at age seven, two years later than American children, still manage to surpass them by
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:15.660]   age nine. Indeed, almost everything Finland does contradicts what some experts in America
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:21.180]   advocate. Most mothers work outside the home, most children are in child care by age one,
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.020]   school begins at age seven, and then only for half-days, children remain in the same
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:30.060]   school from age seven to age 16, there are no gifted programs, class size often reaches
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.700]   30, there are 15 minutes of recess for every 45-minute class, Finnish students spend less
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:40.080]   time in class than any other developed nation, there is no national curriculum and no standardized
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.580]   testing until age 16, all meals are free, as is university education, and there is a
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.760]   high family literacy rate, with reading to children emphasized heavily and supported
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:58.040]   by a powerful public library system. Finally, Finnish families are heavy users of a mechanical
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:09.420]   device that serves as a reading tutor for their children. More on that in chapter 8.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:15.060]   In the 20 years since Eli's study, excuse me, not Beredelit, I mixed up my metaphors,
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:19.940]   I'm not going to tell you, buy the book, read chapter 8, and you'll find out what
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:25.620]   that mechanical device is that serves as a reading tutor for the children of Finnish
[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:30.720]   families. In the 20 years since Eli's study, the Finns have remained atop the International
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.100]   Scoreboard for Reading, Math, and Science, as measured by the Organization for Economic
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:41.140]   Cooperation and Development, OECD, every three years. It's worth noting that one school
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.100]   system in the US comes the closest to mimicking the Finnish environment for teacher assessments,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:52.720]   student demographics, and testing regulations. US military-based schools, exempt from mandated
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   testing and handily outscoring their public school counterparts, who are awash in test
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:07.900]   mania. What do the best readers have in common? In Eli's study, two of the factors that
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:14.440]   produced higher achievement (two others will be found later in chapter 6) are (1) the frequency
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:21.100]   of teachers reading aloud to students, and (2) the frequency of sustained silent reading
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:33.880]   (SSR) or pleasure reading. Children who had daily SSR scored much higher than those who
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:40.520]   had it only once a week. Those two factors also represent the two reading facts we've
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:46.400]   just examined. Reading aloud is the catalyst for the child wanting to read on his own,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.480]   but it also provides a foundation by nurturing the child's listening comprehension. In
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:57.100]   an international study of 150,000 4th graders, researchers found that students who were read
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:04.640]   to often at home scored 30 points higher than students who were read to sometimes. It stands
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.840]   to reason that the more often a child is read to, the more words are heard, bringing the
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.260]   child closer to comprehending more, and the more likely it is the child will associate
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:21.240]   reading with a daily pleasure experience.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:27.080]   Where does phonics fit into all this? There's more than enough research to validate the
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:32.600]   importance of phonics in children's reading. Children who understand the mechanics of reading,
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:37.240]   who know that words are made up of sounds and can break the sound code, have a great
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:43.200]   advantage as the included chart demonstrates. The U.S. Department of Education's 1999
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.080]   Early Childhood Longitudinal Study found that children who were read to at least three times
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:54.360]   a week had a significantly greater phonemic awareness when they entered kindergarten than
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.980]   did children who were read to less often, and that they were almost twice as likely
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.120]   to score in the top 25% in reading.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:10.000]   What phonics cannot do is motivate. Nobody has a favorite vowel or blend. Phonics is
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.160]   like teaching a boy how to wash his neck, an important skill for a growing boy. But
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.040]   teaching him how to scrub is no guarantee he'll have a clean neck even if he knows
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:24.520]   how. The missing ingredient is motivation. If he knows how but doesn't want to wash
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:29.000]   his neck, it's going to stay dirty. But when that boy meets the right girl, he'll
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.860]   be motivated enough to have a clean neck. You need the combination of know-how and motivation.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:41.280]   If you ask doctors, coaches, even probation officers about the importance of motivation
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:46.580]   for the people they're dealing with, they all will tell you it's crucial. In a national
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:52.160]   survey of reading teachers on which education topic most interested them, motivation topped
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:59.360]   the list. Nonetheless, little actual class time is spent in pursuit of motivation, unless
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.640]   you think test prep is motivating.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.800]   What motivates children and adults to read more is that 1) they like the experience,
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.440]   2) they like the subject matter, and 3) they like and follow the lead of people who read
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.600]   a lot.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:20.100]   Is there any read-aloud proof in research? So many read-aloud claims had accumulated
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.440]   in a 30-year period that researchers subjected 33 of them to a meta-analysis to see if the
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.220]   concept lived up to those claims. Looking at the impact of frequent household reading
[00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:36.520]   on preschoolers, the analysis showed clear positive gains for phonemic awareness, language
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:42.340]   growth, and beginning reading skills. In addition, there was just as much of an impact for children
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:50.980]   of a lower socioeconomic status as there was for children with a higher socioeconomic status.
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:56.340]   And the earlier or younger the reading began, the better the results. Research shows that
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:02.080]   even when children reach primary grades, repeated picture book reading of the same book at least
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:09.120]   three times increases vocabulary acquisition by 15 to 40 percent, and the learning is relatively
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:16.140]   permanent. The international assessment of 150,000 fourth graders in 2001 showed an average
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:22.660]   35-point advantage for students who were read to more often by parents.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.780]   The OECD is a 50-year-old cooperative among industrial nations aimed at helping member
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.980]   nations work through the modern growth challenges, including education. For more than a decade,
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.260]   this organization has been testing hundreds of thousands of 15-year-olds in various school
[00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:40.900]   subjects and comparing scores among nations. Since 2006, the OECD has interviewed the parents
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:48.080]   of 5,000 students who were part of the test-taking corps, asking them if they ever read to their
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:54.820]   children when they were in first grade and how often the reading took place. The responses,
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:59.740]   when compared with those children's reading scores on the Program for International Student
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:06.900]   Assessment (PISA) exam, showed a powerful correlation. The more they were read to, the
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:16.860]   higher the scores at age 15, sometimes an advantage of as much as a half-year's schooling.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:21.420]   The results were true regardless of family income.
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.580]   A few years after I had lectured in a Northern California community, one of its residents
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.640]   sent me a copy of a letter to the editor in the local paper. Prompting the letter was
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.280]   an article about a fifth-grade teacher who had been named Teacher of the Year, including
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.180]   a quote from another teacher who marveled at the honoree's ability with voices as
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:45.540]   he read to his students. That apparently outraged a father in the district who wrote, "I also
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:50.740]   am disturbed by his apparent taking of class time to read aloud to his students, capturing
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:55.120]   the voices of the characters and the attention of the students. When did our schools become
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.300]   babysitting centers with story time? By the time my daughter is in the fifth grade, I
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.900]   hope she is able to read to herself. If he wants to recreate characters, he should join
[00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:06.540]   a local theater group."
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:13.080]   Far from being "babysitting," reading aloud has a rich intellectual history. More
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.300]   than 2,000 years ago, Hebrew fathers were urged by the Talmud to take their children
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:23.060]   upon their laps and read to them. 1,000 years later, in that manual of Christian monastic
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:30.620]   life called the Rule of St. Benedict, chapter 38 specifies that meals be taken in silence
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:37.820]   except for the spoken word of the monk designated to read aloud to the diners. Does anyone think
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:43.820]   this was babysitting the monks, the people who kept the lights on through the Dark Ages?
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:48.820]   I would also note that reading aloud at table is still practiced at least once a day among
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:55.100]   the Benedictines, sometimes spiritual readings, other times secular, but never textbooks.
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:59:02.720]   In one monk's words to me, "We have a 1,500-year-old love affair with books and manuscripts."
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:08.020]   As of this writing, the monks at St. John's Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota, are listening
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:13.340]   to "Marcel Brewer and a Committee of Twelve Plan a Church, a Monastic Memoir" by Father
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:19.700]   Hilary Thimmesch. The church in question is St. John's very own, an edifice so magnificent
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:25.940]   the architect I. M. Pei once said it would be world famous if it were located in New
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:27.700]   York City.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:33.080]   Then there is the history of the reader aloud in the labor force. One could even argue that
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:39.520]   this foreshadowed audiobooks. When the cigar industry blossomed in the mid-1800s, supposedly
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.080]   the best tobacco came from Cuba, though much of the industry later moved to the Tampa,
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:49.600]   Florida area. These cigars were hand-rolled by workers who became artisans in the delicate
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:56.240]   craft, producing hundreds of perfectly rolled specimens daily. Artistic as it might have
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.640]   been, it was still repetitious labor done in stifling factories. To break the monotony,
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.960]   workers hit upon the idea of having someone read aloud to them while they worked, known
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.800]   in the trade as la lectura. The reader, of which there were hundreds in the Tampa area
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:20.400]   alone, usually sat on an elevated platform or podium in the middle of the room and read
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.760]   aloud for four hours, covering newspapers, classics, and even Shakespeare. Somehow none
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.920]   of that sounds like babysitting to me.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.280]   As labor became more organized in the United States, the readings kept workers informed
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.040]   of progressive ideas throughout the world as well as entertained. When factory owners
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:45.260]   realized the enlightening impact of the readings, they tried to stop them, but met stiff resistance
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:49.420]   from the workers, each of whom was paying the readers as much as 25 cents per week out
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:54.460]   of pocket. The daily readings added to the workers' intellect and general awareness
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:01:00.320]   while civilizing the atmosphere of the workplace. By the 1930s, however, with cigar sales slumping
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:06.020]   due to the Great Depression and unions growing restive with mechanization on the horizon,
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:11.140]   the owners declared that the reader aloud had to go. Protest strikes followed, but to
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.520]   no avail, and eventually readers were replaced by the radio.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:23.620]   But not in Cuba. The Cuban novelist Miguel Barnett reports, "Today, all over Cuba,
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:28.380]   this tradition is alive and well. Readers are in all the factories, from Santiago to
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.300]   Havana to Pinar del Rio. The readings have specific timetables and generally begin with
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.360]   the headlines of today's newspapers. After reading the newspaper, the readers take a
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:44.340]   break and then begin reading the unfinished book from the day before. Most are women."
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.620]   Unlike the factories of yore, today's Cuban factory settings include modern lighting,
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:53.300]   air conditioning, and microphones with amplifying systems. Considerably better conditions than
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:58.180]   many contemporary American urban classrooms, I might add. Considering the stifling boredom
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.120]   in the American classroom and the fact that many high schools look like factories, schools
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.100]   seem to me to be the perfect setting for "reading aloud" a la Cuba, especially when you couple
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:13.720]   the history of reading aloud with the academic benefits noted here.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:21.700]   As for babysitting, any babysitter who could accomplish all of that would be a bargain.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:27.080]   You mentioned background knowledge. What is it? The easiest way to understand background
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.100]   knowledge is to read the following two paragraphs and see if there is a difference in your understanding
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.840]   of each.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:42.840]   1. But Sabathia, who pitched three days earlier in game three, gave up a lead-off broken-bat
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:50.060]   double to Austin Jackson. He struck out the next two batters, then walked Miguel Cabrera
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:54.880]   intentionally with first base open.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:03:01.960]   Paragraph 2. Callas and Rhodes put on 84, but with the ball turning, Mark Wall could
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.500]   not hit with impunity and his eight overs cost only 37. The run still had to be scored
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.720]   at more than seven and over, with McGrath still to return and Warren having two overs
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.980]   left, when Rhodes pulled rifle to Bevan at deep square leg.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.340]   You probably had an easier time grasping the first paragraph, a newspaper account of a
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:28.040]   baseball game in 2011. The second paragraph came from a newspaper story on the World Cricket
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.320]   Championship in 1999. Any confusion was because the less you know about a subject or the vocabulary
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.320]   associated with that subject, the slower you must read, the more difficult comprehension
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:46.800]   becomes and the less you understand. Sounding out the cricket paragraph phonetically wouldn't
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.320]   have helped much, would it?
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.720]   Background knowledge is one reason children who read the most bring the largest amount
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:58.480]   of information to the learning table and thus understand more of what the teacher or the
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:05.400]   textbook is teaching. Children whose families take them to museums and zoos, who visit historic
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:13.200]   sites, who travel abroad, or who camp in remote areas, accumulate huge chunks of background
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:22.900]   knowledge without even studying. For the impoverished child lacking the travel portfolio of affluence,
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:31.600]   the best way to accumulate background knowledge is by either reading or being read to. Yes,
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.860]   educational TV can help, but most at-risk children are not exposed to it often enough.
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:43.780]   The background knowledge of at-risk students took a further hit with No Child Left Behind
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:50.820]   when 71% of districts narrowed their curriculum to math and reading, curtailing subjects like
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.980]   art, music, science, and languages. The lack of background knowledge surfaces very early
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.540]   in a child's school life. In the longitudinal kindergarten study, researchers found that
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.700]   more than 50% of children coming from the lowest education and income levels finished
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:12.900]   in the bottom quartile in background knowledge. So once again, poverty rears its ugly head
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.100]   as an obstacle to learning.
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:23.100]   What are the skills a child needs for kindergarten? Let me make an analogy here. Inside a child's
[01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:30.380]   brain, there is a huge reservoir called the listening vocabulary. You could say it's
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:35.340]   the child's very own Lake Pontchartrain, the famous estuary outside New Orleans that
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.020]   overflowed because of all the water brought by Hurricane Katrina. That extra water breached
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.080]   the levees and tragically flooded New Orleans. We want the same thing to happen, but not
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:52.900]   in a tragic way. This time, the levees will be breached inside the child's brain. The
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:06:01.220]   first levee would be the speaking vocabulary. You pour enough words into the child's listening
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:09.940]   vocabulary and it will overflow and fill the speaking vocabulary pool. Thus, the child
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:16.940]   starts speaking the words he's heard. It's highly unlikely you'll ever say a word if
[01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:23.580]   you've never heard the word. More than a billion people speak Chinese, so why not the
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:29.900]   rest of us? Because we haven't heard enough Chinese words, especially in our childhoods.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:37.360]   The next levee is the reading vocabulary. It's nearly impossible to understand a word
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:47.060]   in print if you've never said the word. And finally, there's the writing vocabulary.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.660]   If you've never said the word or read the word, how in the world will you be able to
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:59.940]   write it? All the language arts flow from the listening vocabulary, and that has to
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:09.220]   be filled by someone besides the child. Simple. As you read to a child, you're pouring into
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:16.940]   the child's ears and brain all the sounds, syllables, endings, and blendings that will
[01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:23.900]   make up the words she will someday be asked to read and understand. And through stories,
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.180]   you are filling in the background knowledge necessary to understand things that aren't
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:36.180]   in her neighborhood, like war or whales or locomotives. The one pre-kindergarten skill
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:42.100]   that matters above all others, because it is the prime predictor of school success or
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:50.500]   failure, is the child's vocabulary upon entering school. Yes, the child goes to school
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:56.460]   to learn new words, but the words he already knows determine how much of what the teacher
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:06.100]   says will be understood. And since most instruction for the first four years of school is oral,
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.820]   the child who has the largest vocabulary will understand the most, while the child with
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:21.420]   the smallest vocabulary will grasp the least. Once reading begins, personal vocabulary feeds
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:30.820]   or frustrates comprehension, since school grows increasingly complicated with each grade.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:39.020]   That's why school entry vocabulary tests predict so accurately. How is it that some
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:47.660]   kids get a head start on vocabulary? Conversation is the prime garden in which vocabulary grows,
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:53.500]   but conversations vary greatly from home to home. The eye-opening findings of Drs. Betty
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:58.300]   Hart and Todd Risley at the University of Kansas from their research on children's
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:04.260]   early lives demonstrate the impact of this fact. Published as "Meaningful Differences
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:08.340]   in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children," the research began in response
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:14.260]   to what Hart and Risley saw among the four-year-olds in the university lab school. With many children,
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:21.660]   the lines were already drawn. Some were far advanced and some far behind. When the children
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:26.380]   in the study were tested at age three and then again at nine, the differences held.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:32.260]   What caused the differences so early? The researchers began by identifying 42 normal
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:42.460]   families representing three socioeconomic groups, welfare, working class, and professional.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:47.340]   Beginning when the children were seven months old, researchers visited the homes for one
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:55.060]   hour a month and continued their visits for two and a half years. During each visit, the
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.480]   researcher tape-recorded and transcribed by hand any conversations and actions taking
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:08.780]   place in front of the child. Through 1,300 hours of visits, they accumulated 23 million
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:14.660]   bytes of information for the project database, categorizing every word, noun, verb, adjective,
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:21.540]   etc. uttered in front of the child. The project held some surprises. Regardless of socioeconomic
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:30.180]   level, all 42 families said and did the same things with their children. In other words,
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:36.340]   the basic instincts of good parenting are there for most people, rich or poor. Then
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:42.300]   the researchers received the data printout and saw the meaningful differences among the
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:48.780]   42 families. When the daily number of words for each group of children is projected across
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:58.060]   four years, the four-year-old child from the professional family will have heard 45 million
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:09.460]   words, the working class child 26 million, and the welfare child only 13 million. I repeat,
[01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:15.380]   when the daily number of words for each group of children is projected across four years,
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:21.500]   the four-year-old child from the professional family will have heard 45 million words, the
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:30.700]   working class child 26 million, and the welfare child only 13 million. All three children
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:37.500]   will show up for kindergarten on the same day, but one will have heard 32 million fewer
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:45.060]   words. If legislators expect the teacher to get this child caught up, she'll have to
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:54.900]   speak 10 words a second for 900 hours to reach the 32 million mark by year's end. I hope
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:03.060]   they have life support ready for her. Those 42 children would perform differently in class
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:10.020]   because their word totals created different brains. By the time the study group reached
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:17.700]   age 3, the professional's children had 1,100 word vocabularies to the welfare children's
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:30.280]   525. Similarly, their IQs were 117 vs. 79 by the time the study finished. Brain differences
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.620]   have nothing to do with how much parents love their children. They all love their children
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:41.060]   and want the best for them. But some parents have a better idea of what needs to be said
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:47.660]   and done to reach that "best." They know the child needs to hear words repeatedly in
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:52.020]   meaningful sentences and questions, and they know that plunking a two-year-old down in
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.140]   front of a television set for three hours at a time is more harmful than meaningful.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:03.100]   Sociologists George Farkas and Kurt Barron studied the research on 6,800 children from
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:12.060]   ages 3 to 12 and found that children from the lower SES were far more likely to arrive
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:18.820]   at school with smaller vocabularies 12 to 14 months behind, and they seldom made up
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:27.620]   the loss as they grew older. The message in this kind of research is unambiguous. It's
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:33.500]   not the toys in the house that make the difference in children's lives. It's the words in their
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:39.220]   heads. The least expensive thing we can give a child outside of a hug turns out to be the
[01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:45.140]   most valuable. Words. You don't need a job, a checking account, or even a high school
[01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.040]   diploma to talk with a child. If I could select any piece of research that all parents would
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.680]   be exposed to, meaningful differences would be the one. That's feasible. The authors took
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.540]   their 268-page book and condensed it into a six-page article for American Educator,
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.660]   the Journal of the American Federation of Teachers, which may be freely reproduced by
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:09.300]   schools. There is one inexpensive, common-sense move that parents could make that would impact
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:14.100]   their children's language skills and maybe their emotional development as well, yet it
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:19.300]   goes largely unpublicized here in the United States. First, consider how badly it would
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:25.580]   affect a conversation with someone if she wouldn't look at you while you were
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:31.380]   talking to her. Most conversations would slow to a crawl. Let's apply that principle of
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:37.100]   human behavior to children in strollers. Until the 1960s, nearly all strollers were engineered
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:43.020]   so the child was facing the parent. Now it's either way, but far more often facing away.
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:48.460]   Does it make a difference? Researchers found it makes a huge difference in how much conversation
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.820]   takes place between parent and child, twice as much when the child faces the parent. It
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:58.580]   was even more frequent when the child walked with or was carried by the parent. Of course,
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:02.940]   it's not going to help that much if the child is facing the parent and the parent is on
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:10.100]   the cell phone all the time. I interrupt the author to comment that it's far worse since
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:17.620]   2013, because it's not going to help the parent all that much if the child is not facing the
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:23.420]   parent. Excuse me. It's not going to help if the child is facing the parent, the parent
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:30.100]   is on the cell phone all the time, and also the child is on the cell phone all the time.
[01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:37.460]   Make my living staring at a screen and a microphone and evaluate what that is, but it is deeply,
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:45.760]   deeply harmful to conversation for us to be disconnected from the ones that we are together
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:53.620]   with physically so that we can try to forge somewhat tenuous connections from our virtual
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:57.940]   friends.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:05.980]   Where is the better vocabulary? Conversation or reading? Most conversation is plain and
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:12.220]   simple, whether it's between two adults or with children. It consists of the 5,000 words
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:19.700]   we use all the time called the basic lexicon. Indeed, 83% of the words in normal conversation
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.420]   with a child come from the most commonly used thousand words, and it doesn't change much
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:31.620]   as the child ages. Then there are another 5,000 words we use in conversation less often.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:38.740]   Together, these 10,000 words are called the common lexicon. Beyond that 10,000 mark are
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:45.860]   the rare words, and these play a critical role in reading as we grow older. The eventual
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:51.860]   strength of our vocabulary is determined not by the 10,000 common words, but by how many
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:59.300]   rare words we understand. If we don't use these rare words very often in conversation,
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:03.980]   where do we find them? The chart included in the book shows that printed text contains
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:11.700]   the most rare words. Whereas an adult uses only nine rare words per thousand when talking
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:27.380]   with a three-year-old, there are three times as many in a children's book and more than
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:33.580]   seven times as many in a newspaper. As you can see from the chart, oral communication,
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:40.220]   including a TV script, is decidedly inferior to print for building vocabulary. As shown
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:45.280]   by the data for printed material, the number of rare words increases significantly. This
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:50.860]   poses serious problems for at-risk children who hear fewer words and encounter print less
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:58.540]   often at home. Such children face a gigantic word gap that impedes reading progress throughout
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:05.900]   school. And that gap can't possibly be breached in 120 hours of summer school or through morphonics
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:12.700]   instruction. How can I give my kids words if I don't have them? This is a question
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.580]   I've heard from parents who have learning disabilities or for whom English is a second
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:22.020]   language. While there are few easy answers in parenting, this one is easier than most.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.860]   There is a public agency that comes to the rescue in such instances. In fact, it's
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:31.300]   been doing this job for more than a century. What the agency does is take all the nouns,
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:36.220]   verbs, and adjectives a person would ever need and bundle them into little packages
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:41.540]   for anyone to borrow. Free! It asks only that you bring the packages back in a few weeks.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:48.060]   I'm referring to the American Free Public Library, the People's University. And for
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:53.100]   those who can't read the words, they are now available on audio cassette and CD. Forty
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:59.820]   years ago, you had to be blind to get a recorded book in America. Now, anyone can.
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:05.900]   Has anyone ever applied reading aloud and SSR, sustained silent reading, to an at-risk
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:11.620]   school? Just as parents in low-income situations need to be reminded that their task is not
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:19.500]   insurmountable, so too do educators who work with children coming from those homes. Reading
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:24.940]   achievement and pleasure do not have to be mutually exclusive. During his ten years as
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:30.940]   principal of Boston's Solomon Leuenberg Middle School, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:37.100]   his faculty proved it. The pride of Boston's junior high schools during the 1950s and early
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:43.820]   1960s, Leuenberg subsequently suffered the ravages of urban decay. And by 1984, with
[01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.980]   the lowest academic record and Boston teachers calling it the "Looney Bin" instead of
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:53.180]   "Luenberg," the school was earmarked for closing. But first, Boston officials would
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:20:00.860]   give it one last chance. The reins were handed to O'Neill, an upbeat first-year principal
[01:20:00.860 --> 01:20:05.660]   and former high school English teacher whose experience there had taught him to "sell"
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:12.140]   the pleasures and importance of reading. The first thing he did was abolish the school's
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.380]   intercom system. As a teacher, I'd always sworn someday I'd rip that thing off the
[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:21.980]   wall. Now I could do it legally. He then set about establishing structure, routine, and
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:27.740]   discipline. "That's the easy part. What happens after is the important part—reading.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:32.300]   It's the key element in the curriculum. IBM can teach our graduates to work the machine,
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:38.300]   but we have to teach them to read the manual." In O'Neill's first year, sustained silent
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:43.660]   reading was instituted for the nearly 400 pupils and faculty for the last ten minutes
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:49.100]   of the day, during which everyone in the school read for pleasure. Notice "ten minutes."
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:55.100]   Each teacher and administrator was assigned a "room," much to the consternation of
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:59.260]   some who felt those last ten minutes could be better used to clean up the shop or gym.
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:04.860]   "Prove to me on paper," O'Neill challenged them, "that you are busier than I am and
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:10.940]   I'll give you the ten minutes to clean." He had no takers. Within a year, critics became
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:14.540]   supporters and the school was relishing the quiet times that ended the day.
[01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:21.260]   The books that had been started during SSR were often still being read by students filing out to
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:28.460]   buses, in stark contrast to former dismissal scenes that bordered on chaos. The next challenge
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:35.980]   was to ensure that each sixth, seventh, and eighth grade student not only saw an adult
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:43.180]   reading each day, but also heard one. Faculty members were assigned a classroom, and the
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:47.820]   school day began with ten minutes of reading aloud to complement the silent ending at the
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:56.220]   end of the day. Soon, reading aloud began to inspire awareness, and new titles sprouted
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:02.140]   during SSR. In effect, the faculty was doing what the great art schools have always done,
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:09.100]   providing life models from which to draw. In the first year, Leuenberg's scores were up.
[01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:14.940]   In the second year, not only did the scores climb, but so too did student enrollment
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:23.260]   in response to the school's new reputation. Three years later, in 1988, Leuenberg's 570
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:29.340]   students had the highest reading scores in the city of Boston. There was a 15-page waiting
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:35.100]   list of children who wanted to attend. And O'Neill was portrayed by Time as a viable
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:42.300]   alternative to physical force in its cover story on Joe Clark, the bullhorn and bat-toting
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:49.100]   principal from Paterson, New Jersey. Today, Tom O'Neill is retired, but the ripple effect of his
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:55.900]   work has reached shores that not even his great optimism would have anticipated. In the early
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:02.300]   1990s, a junior high school civics teacher in Japan, Hiroshi Hayashi, read the Japanese edition
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:08.780]   of the Read Aloud Handbook. Intrigued by the concept of SSR and Tom O'Neill's example,
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:15.500]   he immediately decided to apply it in his own school. Contrary to what most Americans believe,
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:19.900]   not all Japanese public school students are single-minded overachievers, and many are
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:25.900]   rebellious or reluctant readers, if they are readers at all. Although SSR was a foreign concept
[01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:31.500]   to Japanese secondary education, Hayashi saw quick results in his junior high school with just 10
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:36.460]   minutes at the start of the morning. Unwilling to keep his enthusiasm to himself, he spent the next
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:42.860]   two years sending 40,000 handwritten postcards to administrators in Japanese public schools.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:51.500]   His personal crusade has won accolades from even the faculty skeptics. By 2006,
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:56.700]   more than 3,500 Japanese schools were using SSR to begin their school day.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:04.460]   Who has the time these days? People carry on these days as though the universal clock has
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:10.300]   somehow shrunk from 24 hours to 18. Granted, there are a few people whose work schedules
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:16.060]   are truly beyond the norm. But they are few and far between. If there were a national time
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.540]   shortage, the malls would be empty, Netflix would be defunct, and the cable TV companies would be
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:27.020]   bankrupt. Ultimately, what it boils down to is Sister Patricia Joseph's cautionary words to me
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:33.500]   when I was 16. I was the designated class artist, and she had asked me to draw something for her
[01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:38.700]   bulletin board over the weekend. I showed up empty-handed on Monday with the excuse that I
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:46.860]   hadn't had enough time. With a steely look, she said quietly, "That's alright, James. But please
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:53.820]   understand even the busiest people find the time for the things they truly value." Her thought was
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:59.180]   on target that day, and it still is. If you understand what you've read so far and you truly
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:07.020]   value children and their futures, you will find the time. Like Sister said, it's all about the
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:14.060]   value system. The last word on reading aloud, vocabulary and old brains. Of all the endorsements
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:18.780]   for reading aloud, the following is the most unusual and perhaps most sobering. Back in the
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:23.820]   mid-1990s, two men and a woman sat talking in an office of the University of Kentucky Medical
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:31.100]   Center. One man was an epidemiologist, the other man was a neurologist, and the woman was a
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:36.940]   psycholinguist. All were involved in what would become a celebrated Alzheimer's study. Two of them
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.580]   had been researching an order of nuns who had consented to regular mental examinations and brain
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:46.380]   autopsies upon death and had turned all their personal records over to the researchers. The
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:51.340]   autopsies, when coupled with autobiographical essays written by the nuns when they were about
[01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:59.100]   22 years old, showed a clear connection. Those with the densest sentences, the most ideas jam-packed
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:03.260]   into a sentence without breaking them into separate clauses, were far less likely either
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:09.100]   to develop Alzheimer's or to show its ravages. Simply put, the larger the vocabularies and the
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:14.700]   more complex the thinking processes in youth, the less chance of Alzheimer's damage later,
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.460]   even if they developed a disease. Could the rich vocabulary and crammed thinking process
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:26.300]   in one's youth be an early insurance policy against Alzheimer's? As the three discussed
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:32.540]   these issues, the neurologist Bill Marksbury, father of two, asked Susan Kemper, the psycholinguist,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:37.900]   "What does this mean for our children?" In his absorbing book about the study,
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:44.540]   Aging with Grace, David Snowden, the epidemiologist, describes what followed,
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:50.860]   quoting, "The question caught me off guard, but when I saw the look on his face, I realized that
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:57.180]   he was speaking as a father, not as a scientist." Bill has three grown daughters, and it was clear
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.580]   he wanted to know whether he and his wife, Barbara, had done the right things as parents.
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:07.260]   "Read to them," Susan answered. "It's that simple. It's the most important thing a parent can do with
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:13.900]   their children." Susan explained that idea density depends on at least two important learned skills,
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:19.340]   vocabulary and reading comprehension. And the best way to increase vocabulary and reading
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:24.300]   comprehension is by starting early in life by reading to your children, Susan declared.
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:30.860]   I could see the relief spread over Bill's face. "Barbara and I read to our kids every night,"
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:37.900]   he said proudly. In the years since our study came out, I have been asked Marksbury's question
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:43.340]   many times. Parents ask me if they should play Mozart to their babies or buy them expensive
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.020]   teaching toys or prohibit television or get them started early on the computer.
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:56.300]   I give them the same simple answer Susan Kemper gave to Marksbury, "Read to your children."
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:06.140]   And I hope on that note that if you are interested in more details, you will be motivated to go ahead
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:14.380]   and buy this wonderful book from which I have been reading to you and read it for yourself.
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:23.260]   Again, this is the Read Aloud Handbook by author Jim Trillese. I was reading to you from the
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.340]   seventh edition, the preface and the first chapter. I want to add just simply one comment
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:39.580]   that is from my personal experience and also a little bit of data analysis on this topic.
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:52.060]   I have often been... I have long been a reader, but I have often wished that I were more of a
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:59.420]   reader. I, like you, have frequently found myself distracted by shinier and oftentimes more enticing
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.580]   things. And I've noticed that whenever I stray away from reading, the quality of my thoughts
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:07.340]   goes down, the quality of my life goes down, the quality of my ability to focus goes down,
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:12.220]   the quality of my motivation goes down, and I suffer from it. And then I recognize what's
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:18.860]   happening and if I can correct and I go back to steadily reading, it provides a calming thing for
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:26.380]   me. And it changes my motivation, it gives me clarity on my thinking, etc. My thinking is better
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:33.100]   because of my reading ability. But I'm vastly ahead of many people due to years and years of
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:40.940]   doing it. And I want to point out that in reading, there is simply no substitute for quantity when it
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:48.700]   comes to the basics, the basics of especially things like vocabulary acquisition. I got into
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:54.860]   this heavily a couple of years ago when I started really digging into foreign language acquisition.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:30:03.900]   I had never done any kind of foreign language acquisition. I had never... I took... Let me
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:10.700]   rephrase. I took two years of high school Spanish, just like most people did. I had Spanish one and
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:19.020]   Spanish two. I did a few things right, namely I tried to use the Spanish that I learned and I
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:26.620]   developed the habit of trying to talk to people. And in college, when I was getting ready to go to
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:32.940]   Costa Rica for a study abroad program, in preparation for that, because of course,
[01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:38.060]   I was quite aware of the fact that I couldn't speak Spanish, I got a box of flashcards from
[01:30:38.060 --> 01:30:43.820]   Barnes & Noble that had 1000 Spanish vocabulary words and I forced myself to memorize those 1000
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:50.620]   words before the trip. And when I arrived on the trip, I could speak Spanish. It was
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:56.380]   quite poorly spoken, but I could communicate in most cases. And that made all the difference in
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:31:00.940]   the world from my experience. But I never was a reader in Spanish because it was too hard.
[01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:10.700]   And I came across too many words that I didn't understand. I'm now glad for that experience.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:14.380]   I was annoyed about it for a long time, but I'm now glad for that experience because it's given
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:22.300]   me a greater amount of empathy for people who are not readers. It's really, really frustrating
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:30.380]   to read a book and in every paragraph encounter three or four words that you don't understand.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:34.060]   You think it doesn't matter. You think, "Ah, it's only three to four words. You should be
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:38.460]   able to skip past it and just go on with your life." It does matter. It's really annoying
[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.260]   and it makes you not want to read. And over the years, I would pick up various Spanish books and
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:50.220]   screw up my enthusiasm. "I'm going to read this." And I'd find myself put off by my inability to
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:57.580]   read the words. And I recognized how isolating that is, how stunting that is, how what a block
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:03.100]   it is to learning. That's something I never struggled with in English. So over the years,
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:07.020]   last two years specifically, I started studying foreign language acquisition.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:15.020]   I came across some of the leading academics in the field. The most commonly cited academic in
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:21.340]   the field at this point that I could find is Stephen Krashen, who's also spoken and written
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:27.180]   extensively on simple reading, not for foreign language acquisition, but for primary language
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:32.060]   acquisition. But I also came across the work of Paul Nation, Dr. Paul Nation, New Zealand
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:38.460]   academic who has similarly talked about things. And they both talked about extensive reading.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:47.580]   And I came across a paper that Dr. Paul Nation had written where he talked about how much input
[01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:58.940]   you need to learn the most frequent 9,000 words in a language. Now, there are various estimates
[01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:04.380]   as to how many times you need to actually see a word in order for you to remember it and understand
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:12.380]   it. And back to Jim Trulise's image, first a word has to go into your listening comprehension. And
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:19.580]   then later, some of those words will flow down to your speaking pool where you can actually use them
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   in speaking and then maybe sometime you can use them in writing. But you got to put a lot more
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   words into your comprehension first. And you need to be exposed to words a lot of times.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:37.980]   And there are different estimates, but Dr. Paul Nation used the number of 12 in this particular
[01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:45.100]   publication from 2014. He said that 12 repetitions of a word is a safe bet in most cases. The idea
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:50.700]   being that if you come across a word 12 times and you don't know it, but then you look it up and
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:55.740]   you figure out what it is, after about 12 times, you'll be able to remember it. So you need to see
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:02.060]   a word 12 times in order for you to remember it. What this means is that if you start reading,
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:08.140]   you're going to very quickly learn the most frequently used vocabulary of any language,
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:13.100]   especially including your own, but you're certainly going to be able to acquire foreign
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:20.700]   language vocabulary as well. And so if you calculate the goal of acquiring a 2000-word
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:26.860]   vocabulary, and then we'll go up from a 2000-word vocabulary to a 3000-word vocabulary, 4000-word
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:33.660]   vocabulary, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9000-word vocabulary. And the 9000-word vocabulary would basically be
[01:34:34.540 --> 01:34:40.540]   vocabulary that would allow you to function at the college level in most cases. Not to say that you
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:46.060]   know all the words, you certainly don't. I think the English language has the largest
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:51.500]   vocabulary in the world, like 250,000 words if memory serves me correctly. But you know all of
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:57.100]   the most important words, and then you'll acquire the specialized vocabulary of whatever your
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:05.660]   personal area of expertise is. So how many words – so Natschen did a study and he calculated how
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:14.060]   much do you have to read in order for you to see these words 12 times in order for you to be able
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:23.020]   to learn them. And so at the 2000-word level, you need to be exposed to basically two novels
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:32.780]   is the number, 170,000 tokens. And there are basically 120,000 tokens per novel is the
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:39.900]   estimate that you would use, 220,000 words per novel. So if you're exposed to two novels,
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.900]   you'll be able to acquire, if you can understand them, 2000 words.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:52.380]   Then to go from a 2000-word vocabulary to a 3000-word vocabulary, you need to be exposed
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:36:03.420]   to an additional 300,000 words or three novels. To go from a 3000-word vocabulary up to five,
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:10.460]   total five books read, five novels, full-length novels, to go from a 3000-word vocabulary to a
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:21.420]   4000-word vocabulary, you need to add an additional 530,000 words read or about six novels.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:30.540]   To go from 4000 to 5000, you need to add 1,060,000 words read for about nine books.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:38.140]   To go from a 5000-word vocabulary to 6000, you need to add 1.45 million words read.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:46.860]   The next step requires an additional 2 million words read. To go the next step up from 7000
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:53.740]   to an 8000-word vocabulary, another 2.4 million words read. And then to make that final jump,
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:37:03.340]   to gain an additional 1000 words, you need to read an additional 3 million words
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:11.180]   to gain that next 1000 level of vocabulary. Now, you can speed up the process sometimes.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:16.940]   You may be able to study vocabulary intensively. There may be a case for it, but you can acquire
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:23.260]   it very naturally with reading. And the number is actually quite manageable. So at this point
[01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:31.500]   in time, once I read this, everything became clear to me and I said, "That's it." The total
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:38.860]   number of words needed to acquire a 9000-word foreign language vocabulary is
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:46.860]   about 11 million words. And if you're reading books that have had 120,000 words in them,
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:57.740]   then your number is basically something like just under about 100 books. And if you'll do that,
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:03.580]   you'll acquire the language. It's not possible that you not do it. Now, in the beginning,
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:08.620]   you often have to use some specialized tools to help you with translation. You have to learn some
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:13.420]   basic vocabulary. You have to work with very simple beginner texts. But as soon as you can get
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:21.020]   into books, and as soon as you can read 10 million words, 11 million words, you'll have that
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:25.100]   professional vocabulary that you want in the foreign language. And everything else just kind
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:31.820]   of clicks into place. So the point is, this is the process for readers. It's a numerical process.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:37.900]   For me, that became my simple outline. And so today, I track how much I have read, or at least
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:45.340]   how much I've read in a tracked way, just to get an idea of how I am doing. Over the last year or
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:53.660]   two, I've been learning French. I've read as of today, 1,290,409 words in French. So I know I'm
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:01.580]   about 10 to almost 15%, 12% of the way towards my goal. And it may take me seven or eight years to
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:08.140]   work my way towards that 10 million words read. But I know that I can already tell by my current
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:13.740]   vocabulary, I can already tell that my ability to recognize words is very good. I can pick up at
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:18.140]   this point in time. A year ago, I couldn't pick up any text and really understand it other than
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:24.300]   the obvious cognates. But there's so few of those, you can't do it. Today, I can pick up almost any
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:31.500]   text and I can get the gist of it, at least in terms of recognition. I can't use those words. I
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:35.740]   can't use them actively. They don't spill out of me with spoken language. I couldn't write them in
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:40.860]   any chance, but I can recognize them. And that's the first stage of learning. So in many ways, I
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:45.020]   feel like a kindergartner going through that process. And so you can do this and you can help
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:50.140]   your children. And it's a numerical thing. Can you expose your children to 10 million words?
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:55.020]   Now, you can go back and you can say, "Well, how long does that take? How long does it take to
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:59.340]   actually acquire those words?" Well, here it depends on your reading skill. And I'll just
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:06.620]   give you an example from myself where I tracked this stuff to try to figure out and did some
[01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:14.620]   measurements to try to figure out my own numbers. I can read pretty quickly in English. I don't do
[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:21.580]   much speed reading. I have studied a little bit and I can speed read things if they are in my area
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:27.020]   of expertise. I can't speed read anything that's outside of my area of expertise. I can read a
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:32.140]   financial book, any book on the shelf at Barnes & Noble, I can read a financial book in 5 to 15
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:35.980]   minutes because I'm familiar with the concepts. I can pick it up. I can see the headings. I can
[01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:41.900]   look at the table of contents and I can close the book and pretty much, I won't be able to give you
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.220]   the stories in it, but just to flip through the pages and I could summarize the book for you
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:53.500]   because it's something that I know very, very well. Give me an entry-level medical textbook,
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:59.900]   I don't know it. It's not my field. I don't understand it. I can't do it at all. I have
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:06.060]   no context. So this is where you see familiarity. But let me just give you an example here.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:11.420]   The first thing you can do to figure out how long it would take to be exposed to these words
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:18.620]   is look at the word count and then compare the length of the word count to an audiobook
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:26.060]   version of that word count. Let's begin with an audio example and I'll tell you how I did
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.180]   this with foreign language. The same principle applies to your children. A book that I read
[01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:38.940]   last year, I read the Jason Bourne novel by Robert Ludlam. I read the trilogy, the original trilogy.
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:44.140]   It wasn't awesome, it was okay, but I read the original trilogy in French. First thing you can
[01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:51.900]   do is I like to, I use Kobo.com to get, and one of the things that nice thing that Kobo does is
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:57.260]   they include a word count on the books. Amazon will include a page count, but they include a
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:04.700]   word count. So as an example here, La Vengeance dans la Peau has a word count, it's a 904-page
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:17.900]   novel. It has a word count of 262,000 words in it. Now Kobo estimates that that will take 21 to 23
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:26.140]   hours to read. We'll come back to those hour estimates in a moment. But for me, what I have
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:33.580]   found is that I have my, we can start with the very least with how long it takes to read aloud.
[01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:40.620]   And so I also have the audible recording from this book, and the audible recording for this book is
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:48.860]   28 hours and 18 minutes long. So remember the word count is 262,000 words and it's 28 hours and 18
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:57.260]   minutes long. So if we divide that, we get 1,690 minutes. The audible reader is reading at a rate
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:07.180]   of 155 words per minute. That comes out to 9,300 words per hour. So when I'm reading, if we were to
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:13.020]   go back and recognize that I read to you for about an hour and I guess 15 minutes, hour and 20 minutes
[01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:21.980]   from the book that I read to you, you would wind up with probably around 12,000 words that I read to
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:27.340]   you. Now go back to that language acquisition, those numbers that I said from the Paul Nation
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:33.980]   foreign language study. If your goal is 10 million words in a foreign language, or if your goal for
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:40.300]   your child is to read your child over time 10 million words, and you're reading books that are
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.620]   not a lot of pictures, with a child usually you're starting, you're always starting with pictures
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:48.220]   and you're reading slowly and you're talking and you're giggling and you're laughing, you're not
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:54.620]   just reading. But if you're just reading, then you probably would be reading at about 9,000 words per
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:44:04.460]   hour. So if you take 9,300 words per hour and your goal is to expose your child to 10 million words,
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.260]   depending on how long you want to do that, that's 1,075 hours of reading.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:17.980]   So 1,075 hours of reading, let's say you do 30 minutes per day, that would be
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:29.180]   500 and, excuse me, 1,075 hours times two for 35 minutes a day. Then over the course of about
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:35.100]   six years at 30 minutes a day, you would wind up reading the 10 million words that you want to,
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:41.980]   to give your child the gift of a large vocabulary. You can do it faster. And this is the same thing
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.300]   with foreign language acquisition. If I need to read and I need to have read to me at the slowest
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.900]   pace, listening to the audio book, which was how I started learning French, I just put on the audio
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:56.780]   book and I listened and I read along and I use link to read and track my word count and then I
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:45:04.300]   listen to the audio book, I know I need 1,075 hours of reading. And so if I were super intense
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:11.100]   and I needed to learn French really quickly and I needed to do it really very fast and I had a year,
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:16.380]   well, in three hours a day of reading, I can expose myself to the 10 million words.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:22.060]   If I was doing it full time and I really had a motivated reason, I could do eight hours a day
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:28.940]   of reading, then in 134 days I could do it and I could have a very broad vocabulary. I don't
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.660]   do that. It's not my goal, but if 30 minutes a day, right, you could do the math. You can figure
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:40.620]   out how long it takes you to read the 10 million words at the slowest pace, which is an audio book.
[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:48.540]   Now let's go back to the Kobo estimates. The Kobo estimates for that book of 262,000 words are 21
[01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:58.940]   to 23 hours to read it, rather than the over 28 hours that are required for the reader. And so
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:03.180]   here you can just simply do a reading test for yourself and you can calculate how long it would
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:10.300]   take you to figure out how to read the amount of words that your goal is to read. And your speed
[01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:18.060]   will vary based upon your proficiency. For me as an accomplished English reader, I read at
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:29.340]   a significantly faster rate than the estimates are. So for example, I read a book, I did actually
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:36.700]   tracked it this past year. I was curious what my English reading speed was. I read an English novel
[01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:42.380]   that was, it was actually Doug Casey's book, Drug Lord, which is part of his trilogy. That was
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:48.540]   interesting and great. I really enjoyed it. Great trilogy. But I read an English novel,
[01:46:48.540 --> 01:46:57.900]   it was 150,000 total words, 555 pages. The Kobo estimate on that particular book is 12 to 13 hours
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:04.300]   to read it. I tracked, I read, I didn't speed read it. I read it at my enjoyable novel pace.
[01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:08.860]   I read every word, just kind of working my way through it, enjoying front to back. No, just I
[01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:15.660]   was reading it to enjoy it as a simple pleasure novel of an interesting story written by an
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:22.940]   interesting guy. It took me 6.9 hours, total of 414 minutes to read it, which was a little under
[01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:31.500]   half, just about half of the 12 to 13 hours that the Kobo estimate gave to it. So my English reading
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:43.180]   speed with that novel was 362 words per minute or 21,739 words per hour. So I can accumulate a lot
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:50.140]   of English words much more quickly. Now in foreign language, with Spanish, I read a little bit
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:55.740]   faster, maybe about 15% faster than the Kobo estimates. I did a speed test, but I don't have
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:00.060]   that data in front of me, but I did a speed test for myself on a Spanish book. And then with my
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:06.860]   French books, I'm pretty slow, but a little tiny bit faster than the narrator. At this point in
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:14.060]   time, I've bumped the narrator up to about 1.1, 1.2 speed on Audible when reading books. And
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:19.820]   that's fine. I still have to absorb, even if I know the word, I still have to absorb the meaning.
[01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:26.940]   So you can calculate, that's my point, you can calculate how quickly you can get to this goal
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:33.020]   if you want to. Now go to your own reader, right, your child. And I want you to calculate how many
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:40.620]   words your child would be exposed to if you read to your child three hours a day versus 30 minutes
[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:49.580]   a day. Think back to how transformative 10 minutes a day is for those classrooms. 10 minutes a day of
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:55.420]   silent reading and/or 10 minutes a day of being read to. 30 minutes a day is wonderful, do what
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:49:01.500]   you can do. But imagine if you can read to your child for three hours a day. Imagine the vocabulary
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:09.580]   acquisition that is possible for you. Imagine if you can be more. And here where we wind up saying
[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:13.980]   that childhood is not all about reading. There are other things that are important, right? Free
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:19.420]   play, et cetera, is important. Academics are not everything. But you can calculate the reading speed
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:24.540]   that you have of reading aloud or your reading speed yourself. And you can put that on a chart
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:31.900]   and you can just, it's shocking how big of a return it is. I want you to imagine the difference
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:37.580]   for yourself, for your children, et cetera, if you read to them and/or they read to themselves.
[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:45.740]   If you recognize how you cannot learn something that you cannot understand,
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:51.660]   in order for you to understand something, you need vocabulary. And vocabulary can be imparted
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:57.980]   so efficiently with reading. There is no better way of acquiring vocabulary than reading. Because
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:05.340]   your speed, you can go as fast or as slow as you need to. And it should show you why it's so
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:09.980]   powerful and why reading to your children, especially when they're before the age of
[01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:14.460]   reading, why it makes a difference. And of course, you can supplement. You can use audio books. You
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:21.660]   can use things like that as well as a supplement. And so there's no supplement for reading to your
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:26.060]   child. My children, if I let them, I mean, they wouldn't read all day because of course they need
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:32.220]   to play and be active and move. But it's like they can't get enough because we've always read to
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:37.340]   them and they just, "Oh, can you read this? Can you read that?" And so if you get good books,
[01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:42.860]   you can pump that into them. And then that enhances their brain and enhances their vocabulary. And it
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:49.020]   just, you can see it. It affects them more than virtually anything else. There are many other
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:53.660]   things that you can do to help your children, right? Lots of exercise, lots of sunshine,
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:59.100]   lots of playing music and lots of love and hugs and snuggles and all that stuff.
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:04.540]   But in terms of intellectual development, to prepare your child for academic excellence,
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:10.060]   kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, most important thing is simply reading.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:16.220]   There's no way around it. Reading aloud to them, having them read aloud to, right? Use audio books.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:25.980]   We do have an embarrassment of riches. We use a ton of LibriVox books. LibriVox books have
[01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:31.340]   wonderful classic stories, high-quality literature available. And your child will be able to listen
[01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:38.540]   to literature that's several grade levels beyond their reading ability. And in addition, Audible
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:43.660]   is wonderful for paid ones, for more current ones. LibriVox is all stuff that's in the public domain.
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:49.100]   And then of course, your reading to your child and/or having your child read to by others
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:55.340]   is one of the best things that you can possibly do. It's simple. It's inexpensive. It doesn't
[01:51:55.340 --> 01:52:04.220]   take that much time, but it pays off in spades, in massive, massive dividends.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:08.140]   So I hope that this additional information, kind of some of these numbers in my reading from the
[01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:14.460]   book will help you to see why there's really no better investment that you can make into
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:22.460]   your children's educational future than simply reading to them and then surrounding them with
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:28.140]   books that they love, that they will read themselves. And if you'll do that, 80%
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:37.580]   of your work is done. If you will intentionally create and cultivate a reader for a child,
[01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:46.300]   then all you need to do is supply the right books and the educational process is automatic.
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:53.660]   The heavy lifting is in the beginning. First, a lot of hours of reading, but that's fun. That's
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:53:03.180]   bonding time. It's snuggling time. Then teaching how to read, how to decode the phonics. Then
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:09.180]   continuing to read just for time together, but then supplying the right books.
[01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:15.340]   Once that's done, education is basically done. Talk about mathematics another day.
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:24.140]   The evidence is abundant. Read to your children. It's a wonderful investment into them and into
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:30.300]   your family life and into their educational future. If you come to me and you say, "I didn't
[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:37.180]   save a dime for my kids' college, but I read to my children for an hour a day, every day for the
[01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:43.420]   first 10 years of their life," you won't have a thing to worry about with college, I promise.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:49.020]   Absolutely guaranteed. Thanks for listening. Be back with you soon.
