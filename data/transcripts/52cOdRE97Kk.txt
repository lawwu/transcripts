[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   How should people think about systemic damage and recovery?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   Because obviously the nervous system and the way it interacts with the neuromuscular system
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.440]   is the site of all the action here, or at least a lot of the action.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.240]   And the nervous system can in fact become fatigued.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   It has a great capacity, but the whole system that we're talking about can be worked to
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.320]   the extent that even if a muscle group, like the biceps or the back, is being allowed to
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.360]   rest while you're training legs and other muscle groups, that your whole neuromuscular
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.400]   system needs rest.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.160]   How does one determine whether or not your entire body needs complete rest, or low-level
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.280]   active rest, or exercise of a different kind?
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280]   Yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.320]   So I want to actually tackle this because we're on the topic of hypertrophy.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.040]   I'm assuming that that's the goal in mind here.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.080]   Yes, here I'm asking specifically within the context of hypertrophy.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.120]   I realize that for other training goals the answer to this question could be quite different.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   Yeah, okay.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   So we actually do this in a couple of different ways.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.240]   Let's start local and work back to systemic, right?
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.840]   Because number one, what you're really concerned about is at the local muscle level is am I
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.280]   going to create excessive damage?
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840]   And I don't necessarily mean muscle damage here, I mean injury, right?
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.200]   So the kind of rule of thumb we use is like three out of ten in terms of soreness.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.680]   If you're more than three out of ten in terms of soreness, we're going to start asking
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   questions.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320]   If you're six out of ten, we're probably not training.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   This is a subjective measure.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.960]   Total subjective measure, right?
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.720]   And you'll know very quickly, right?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   If you can barely graze your pec with your fingertip and then you're like, "Ah, I don't
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.520]   care what you score that, we're not training.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.640]   There's just no damage."
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.000]   If you're three out of ten, if you're just like, "Oh, I'm kind of like a little bit stiff
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.320]   here," but once you get warmed up you start feeling okay, you're probably okay to proceed
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   there.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.320]   So that is a very easy way to just think about soreness.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.240]   You're going to be a little bit tight depending on your training frequency.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.040]   Now zooming out to systemic, we use a whole host of things.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.280]   So we actually have a whole host of biomarkers we use.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   You can get a lot of these from blood.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   So you can look at things like creatine kinase, that's the very common one marker of muscle
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   damage.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.560]   We'll actually look at LDH, we'll look at myoglobulin.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.520]   That's just likeâ€”if you think about hemoglobin is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   your blood.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.360]   The myoglobin is the part of that that's actually in muscle.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.000]   So when muscle gets broken down, that gets leaked out and put in your blood.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.400]   That's one of the markers actually that's going to be associated with things like rhabdo,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.320]   which is like you're going to see your urine is purple and it's extremely dark because
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.280]   you've got so much muscle breakdown that happens and kidneys can have a problem and you put
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   a bunch of stuff in there.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   So we use those biomarkers.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.160]   We'll actually also look at probably a couple of things you're familiar with, ALT and ASD.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   These are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   So if we are actually suspecting that this is a chronic problem, we're going to actually
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   go in and pull some blood.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.560]   If it's just like I'm super sore today, we're going to use that subjective marker.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.920]   But if we're seeing this as constant, like man, are we really pushing you way too much,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.160]   is there some sort of systemic problem, we're going to blood and we're going to look at
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   all those different things.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.200]   Now, AST to ALT is really specific and I don't want to take us too far off track here, but
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.560]   the ratio to those things is actually very important as well.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.840]   So if you look at the AST to ALT ratio, typically the number we'll look at is like 1.67.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000]   As that ratio is like higher than that, you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   But really between, you know, me and you and a few of these listeners, any time we start
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.200]   seeing AST outkick ALT, we're immediately thinking, as in the ratio being higher than
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.840]   1, we're immediately thinking like there's something happening muscle damage-wise.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   So that's actually a sneaky good indicator of just total muscle mass, because the vast
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.760]   majority of that's going to be in muscle.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   So those are actually some markers that we like a lot if muscle damage is the thing we're
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.160]   concerned with.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080]   If we are more concerned with things like total training volume, systemic overload,
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.000]   then we may turn to something more like sleep.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.440]   There's a lot of information we can actually glean from changes in sleep behavior and function.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.280]   You can also look at things like HRV, heart rate variability, which is a very classic
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   marker and much more sensitive to changes with training than something like a resting
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.560]   heart rate, which is one thing you can actually do that's totally cost-free.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.120]   Just look at your changes and any elevation resting heart rate over time, especially more
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.080]   than three to five consecutive days is an indicator.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.600]   But HRV is much more sensitive to things like training-induced overload.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.520]   So that's a quick version of stuff that we're going to pay attention to.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.000]   The last one I would add there is simply motivation.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.100]   So if you're really training hard and you like training hard and you just like cannot
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.360]   force yourself to go anymore, that in and of itself can be a good indication of it's
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.800]   maybe not the day, maybe not the week.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.040]   With all of these things, you want to be careful about overreacting to a single day measure.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   Again, we need to look at at least a trend of more than three days.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.920]   Honestly, I'm looking at more than five days.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.160]   I'm going to pull back from that and think about what phase of training we're in, what
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.560]   part of the year we're in, typically whether it's in-season, pre-season, post-season, off-season,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   et cetera, to make our decision about what we're going to do about it.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.320]   Are we canning the entire workout?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.720]   Are we doing a modified, lower version, lower intensity?
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.200]   My default generally, if hypertrophy is the goal, remember, volume is the driver there.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.160]   So if I can, like can we get in, can we go real light, let's go to six out of ten RPE.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.480]   So relative perceived exertion.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.640]   Maybe we'll reduce the range of motion.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.840]   Maybe we'll make it a little bit easier.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.640]   Maybe go to machines or instead of going to squat, we'll just do leg extension or something
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.640]   like that.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.080]   But I want to still get enough volume in there.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.480]   That will keep you on target, and again, even going at 50%, not to high repetition, 50%
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.800]   for a set of ten, three sets.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.000]   Just get a nice blood flow in there, get it in, get it out, aid in recovery, and then
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.400]   move on and come back the next day.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.600]   That's probably what I would do rather than canning the entire session.
