[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   When Erdogan was consolidating control of Turkey, Erdogan came out and he said, "I think
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.680]   Twitter is the primary challenge to the survival of any political regime."
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.100]   And I was like, "Okay, all the smart analysts all think this is worthless.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.280]   And then a guy who's actually trying to keep control of a country is like, 'This is my
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   number one threat.'"
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.200]   My conclusion was, "Erdogan is right, and all the smart Westerners are wrong."
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.380]   We're still pretty early in the long arc of social media.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.700]   The world in which five billion people are on the internet is still only a decade or
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.960]   so old.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.800]   It took 200 years to fully play out the consequences of the printing press.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.880]   We're still in the very early stages with these things.
