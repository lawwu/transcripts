[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.200]   All right, moving on here, we have a question from Rodrigo.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.080]   Rodrigo asks, do you recommend listening to music
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.040]   while doing deep work?
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.160]   Well, it's up to you.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.600]   Some people do, some people don't.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.240]   What I always tell people when they ask about this
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.160]   is that music can help you drown out other distractions
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.200]   and get into the mood of deep work
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000]   if you practice first doing deep work
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.820]   with that specific type of music.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.160]   So it is a trainable thing.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.960]   If you listen to the same Mozart sonatas
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.720]   every time you do deep work, the first few sessions,
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.000]   you might actually find it a little bit distracting.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.440]   But after a while, your brain learns to filter it out,
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.760]   and it can be effective.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.600]   So that's the only caveat I would give.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.760]   The people who use music have practiced
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.600]   working with that music.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.840]   This can get pretty extreme.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.360]   And I do tell the story sometimes
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.040]   of a novelist I interviewed years ago who
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.080]   had four kids at home.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.920]   It was a very noisy home.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.800]   And he had to work there.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.640]   And he wrote a lot.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.000]   He was a self-published novelist who did a lot of word count.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   And what he did in the end was got NASCAR-style headphones.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.240]   So they're heavily insulated, and you can also play audio
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.560]   through them.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.240]   Because I guess at NASCAR, what you do
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.400]   is you wear these really insulated headset headphones,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.480]   but you want the audio of the commentary playing.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.040]   And he would put Metallica, would blast Metallica
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.560]   into these heavily insulated headphone speakers.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.440]   So there was literally no sound from his kids.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.360]   That's what it takes.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   And I have three kids, so I can attest to this.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.200]   That is probably what it takes to actually eliminate
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.160]   the sound of your kids from your life if they're home
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160]   and you are trying to work at home.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.800]   That's what it really takes.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.040]   He learned to write pretty productively with Metallica
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.200]   blasting in his ears.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.640]   If I tried this now, it would be incredibly distracting.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.240]   If I did this consistently for two weeks,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.640]   my mind would easily tune it out.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.600]   It would actually probably be pretty effective.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.320]   So Rodrigo, it's all about practice.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.640]   (upbeat music)
