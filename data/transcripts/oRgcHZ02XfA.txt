[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We are considering the general subject of the biblical doctrine of redemption.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And we began, of course, by considering God's covenant with men,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   the covenant of grace, the covenant of redemption.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And we saw that that all along, in the old expression of it and in the new,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   always points to the one person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Redemption is in Him.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And last Friday evening we spent our time, therefore, in looking at Him.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   We have started, in other words, the consideration of the biblical doctrine
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   That, as you notice, I put under the general heading of the doctrine of redemption.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And I think one must do so.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We have looked at the person of our Lord in dealing with the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   But specifically, when you consider the doctrine of redemption,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   you must, of course, concentrate your attention upon the person and the work
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Now then, last week we found that the whole Bible looks to Him and points at Him.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   He is the fulfillment of all the Old Testament promises and prophecies.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   The whole Bible points to Him, the old forward to Him, the new backward to Him.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It is in Him that everything is done.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It is in His hands that all power lies, according to the Bible.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And it is above all He by whom the world shall finally be judged.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Therefore, the Bible everywhere calls upon us and urges us to consider Him.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And then we saw that when you do come to consider Him,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   you are at once confronted by the first particular doctrine with respect to Him.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And that is the doctrine of the incarnation.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I just mentioned that at the end last Friday.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And we defined it in general only on that occasion.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We reminded one another that it states this,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   that the eternal Son of God, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   took on Him and unto Himself human nature.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We said that it didn't mean that a new personality came into being,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   but that God the eternal Son became incarnate.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   My final word was this, that it was necessary to take that statement,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   that general statement, and to break it up.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And that for this reason,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   that it is something that has been so frequently misunderstood.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And as our salvation and our eternal destiny
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   depends upon our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   what can be more important than that we should be clear and certain
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   in our ideas and in our thoughts concerning Him.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And of course, history shows very clearly,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   indeed before you come to history, the New Testament itself shows this very clearly,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   that the devil is concerned about nothing more
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   than he is about leading people astray
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   with regard to the person and the work of our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That is why I say we can take no risks.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And we cannot contend to ourselves
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   with a mere general statement of the doctrine of the incarnation.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We must break it up, we must analyze it,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   we must show what it does say and what it doesn't say,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   lest any of us inadvertently should fall into error.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Very well then, I propose to make to you now the following series of statements.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The first clearly is this,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   the doctrine of the person of our Lord
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and the doctrine of the incarnation in particular
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   shows us again the all-importance of the doctrine of the Trinity.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Now, we considered that doctrine of the Trinity many months ago.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And as we come to consider this doctrine now,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   we shall see why it was so important for us to have considered it then.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   The whole Christian position, in a sense,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   depends upon the doctrine of the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   If we don't believe in the doctrine of the Trinity, we cannot be Christian.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's impossible.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   A person who doesn't believe in the Trinity
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   cannot really believe in the Christian position
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   because he cannot really believe in the doctrine of redemption.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Therefore, as we talk about the person of the Son,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   we see how important it is always to realize
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   that the blessed God exists in three persons,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That's my first comment.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The second is that what the doctrine of the incarnation asserts is
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   not that the eternal triune God became flesh,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   but that the second person in the triune God became flesh.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The scripture puts it like this, doesn't it?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It says, "The Word was made flesh."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now, this is surely something which we must emphasize.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We often speak rather loosely, I'm afraid, in talking about the incarnation,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and many of our hymns tend to do the same thing.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But to me, it seems always to be wise
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   not to say that God became man.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That is a loose statement which we'd better not use.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   We often do say that God became man.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Well, now, that's a very loose statement.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   What we should say is that the Word was made flesh
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   or that the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity was made flesh
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and appeared as man.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   If we merely say God became man,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   well, we may be saying something that is quite wrong,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   and if people do say something wrong as the result of our statement,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   we can't really blame them.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We must be particular, we must be specific.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Believing as we do in the three persons in the Trinity,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   we should always be careful to say that what we say is
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   that the second person in the Trinity was made flesh.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   The third statement is this,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   that the doctrine of the incarnation
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   does not say that it was not merely an appearance
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   or a form that was taken on
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   by the second person in the Trinity,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   but that it was indeed a true incarnation.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   He did come in the flesh.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It wasn't an appearance, it wasn't a mere form.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Now, you notice why I'm emphasizing that.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I do so because it's quite clear that in the very early years of the Christian church,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   there were people who went into error and into heresy about that,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   the so-called Gnostics.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   They said that our Lord had the mere appearance of flesh.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It was the mere phantom body, an appearance of a body.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   The doctrine of the incarnation doesn't say that.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It says it wasn't an appearance, it was real.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It was a true incarnation.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   The word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Point number four is, again, a negative one.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The doctrine of the incarnation does not say that it was merely the divine nature
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   that somehow became united with human nature and so formed a person.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It isn't merely the divine nature.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It is the second person himself, the person, who became flesh.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Now, there were many in the early ages of the church,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   and they've persisted throughout the centuries,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   who haven't really understood that.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   What they think you see in Jesus Christ is divine nature,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   human nature, forming a person.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   That isn't true.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It was the second person, the eternal person in the blessed Trinity himself,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   that took unto him human nature and appeared in that form.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And you see the significance of that.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   You remember, perhaps, that last Friday night, I did put it like this,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   that the doctrine of the incarnation does not teach the creation of a new person.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   What it teaches is that the eternal second person in the Trinity
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   took unto him flesh and appeared in this world in the likeness of men.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Not a new person, this eternal person.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Very well, the next point, then, is this one.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The doctrine of the incarnation does not teach,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   neither does it involve the idea that a change took place
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   in the personality of the second person of the Trinity.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   There was no change in his personality.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   There was a change in the form in which he appeared.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   There was a change in the state in which he manifests himself.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   But he is the same person always.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   In the womb of the Virgin Mary, he is still the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Lying as a helpless babe in the manger, he is still the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   There was no change in his person, though he has changed his state.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   The next definition I put in this form.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We must never so state the doctrine of the incarnation
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   as to give the impression, therefore, that we say that the Son of God was changed into a man.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   That is why that phrase about God becoming man is misleading.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We do not mean, I say, that the Son of God was changed into a man.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   No, that is not so.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Now, you remember the statement in John 1, 14,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   That very phrase, "was made," has often caused people to think
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   that the Son of God was changed into a man.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It's partly due to the fact that it isn't really the best translation.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Instead of saying, "The Word was made flesh,"
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   what we really mean was, "He became," if you like, or "took on flesh."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   The idea of "making" gives the impression of being changed into, but that's wrong.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   In other words, the way in which the Scripture generally puts it is this.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   In Romans 8, 3, for instance, we are told that He came in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   That's better.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Or take it as you get it in the first epistle of John, 4, 2.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "Hereby," says John, "know ye the Spirit of God?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God."
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's the idea. Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's this eternal person who has come in the flesh.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   He hasn't been made man. He hasn't been changed into a man.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   He has come in the flesh.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   That's the right way to put it.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   The next principle will take this form.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That our Lord did not merely take the appearance of human nature,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   but it was real, true human nature.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Now, let me explain that in this way.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   We have accounts, have we not, in the Old Testament of various angels
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   appearing to various people, and we are told that they appeared in human form.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Now, when we say that the angels appeared in that way, in human form,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   we are not talking about an incarnation.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   That is an appearance.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   The angels didn't change their nature. They didn't add to it in any way.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   They just took on that form.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Indeed, we saw, you remember, long ago, that our Lord himself had appeared in that way.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   We spoke about the angel of the covenant.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   The angel of the covenant in the Old Testament is undoubtedly the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And he appeared more than once to various people in the form of a man.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   That is what we call a theophany.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Now, theophany, t-h-e-o-p-h-a-n-y, theophany, is entirely different from incarnation.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Theophany means that an angelic or a divine person appears in this form for the time being.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   But the incarnation says, the doctrine of the incarnation asserts,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   that the Lord Jesus Christ has really taken on human nature.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Not its appearance, but real human nature itself.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now, there are many statements which say that. Let me give you two.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Hebrews 2, 16, for instance. Hebrews 2, 14, I'm sorry.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Hebrews 2, 14, "For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   he also likewise himself took part of the same."
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   He really did take unto him human nature.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   "Not unto angels does he stretch forth a helping hand," says that same chapter,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   "but he does so to the seed of Abraham."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And that's what he's taken on.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Take also the second epistle of John, verse 7.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   We read there that many deceivers are entered into the world,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   There is no doubt at all that John wrote his three epistles
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   in order to counter that terrible, dangerous heresy that had come in, in that way,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   as I was mentioning just now.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   This denial that he really had come in the flesh, that it was a mere appearance.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Some would say, you see, that the Messiah entered into this man Jesus
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   at his baptism and left him on the cross.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And others say that the whole thing was a phantom and an appearance.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Now the New Testament, John especially in those epistles,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   not only denies that, it denounces it as being the most dangerous error.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   That is the very lie of the Antichrist.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And therefore we must be very sure and certain
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   that we are clear about these things in our minds.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   That brings me to the next statement.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   The doctrine of the Incarnation asserts
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that our Lord took unto himself a full and a complete human nature.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   It wasn't merely partial, it was complete.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He didn't merely take a body to himself.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Now there are people throughout the centuries who've taught that.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   They say that the Son of God only took on a human body.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   That's wrong.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   There are others who say that he took on a body and a kind of animal soul,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   but that the spiritual part of the soul was provided by the eternal person.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   That's wrong also.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   The doctrine of the Incarnation teaches that he took on him complete human nature,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   body and soul, including spirit, that he was truly man.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   I shall have to emphasize this again,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   but it has to be emphasized at this point also.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It wasn't a partial human nature.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It was an entire, a complete, a whole human nature that he took unto himself.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And my last point under this general heading is this one.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That he took on this real and complete human nature from the Virgin Mary.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   In other words, that means this.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   We must not say that a new human nature was created for him.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Some people have taught that.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   That God created a new human nature for his Son,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and that this human nature, as it were, merely passed through Mary.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   That's wrong.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   The doctrine states that he derived, got his human nature from his mother, the Virgin Mary.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   He received human nature from her.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It was not a new creation.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   He didn't bring his human nature with him.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   He found it, he received it, he obtained it from her.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And therefore, as the scripture often emphasizes,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   he is truly of the seed of Abraham and of the seed of David.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Here it is in the first verse, in this first chapter of Matthew.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Now if a special human nature had been created for him,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   he would not have been the Son of David nor the Son of Abraham.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   But he was the Son of David and of Abraham,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   because his human nature came from his mother, the Virgin Mary.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Again, let me emphasize this,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   that what he had was not a human nature that was merely like ours,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   but not really a part of ours,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and not organically related to it.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   He actually did receive our nature.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Go back again to that verse in the second of Hebrews, which I've emphasized.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   He really does belong, therefore, to the human race.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   He is one with us in that race,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   because he has received his human nature in that way.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Now, I mustn't stop with this, tempted as I am to do so.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I'm concerned about all that for this reason,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   that the doctrine of our redemption ultimately depends upon that.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   If it was not our human nature, he could not have saved us.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   As the second chapter of the Hebrews argues so clearly,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   because we are partakers of this flesh and blood, he had to partake of the same.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It's the only way in which he can save us.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   So we can't afford to take any risks about this doctrine.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   We can't afford to say, "Oh, well, it doesn't matter what your precise statement is.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   That is to be utterly unscriptural.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   We must be precise and clear and certain and definite in all our statements.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Otherwise, without knowing it, we may make the doctrine of our own redemption quite impossible."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Very well.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   There then we have had a detailed definition of this doctrine of the incarnation.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   That is what it says,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   that the second person in the eternal, blessed, holy Trinity
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   has taken unto himself and to himself human nature
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and thus has appeared in the likeness of men and in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   here in this world of time.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Very well.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Having said that, we've been looking at the mystery of the incarnation.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And at once the question arises, how did all this come to pass?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   How did it take place?
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   How did this extraordinary thing become actual?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   That, you see, leads us immediately to the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I do trust that we are all observing the order in which we are taking them.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   I do indeed conceive it to be my main function in these addresses to show you the order,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   the details and the facts you can derive from the scriptures themselves.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   But my main idea is to give you the order, the idea as it's worked out in the scripture.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And so, by a logical inevitability, we arrive at the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   What is this?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Well, you remember the Apostles' Creed, the first creed of all, the first great confession,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   puts it like this, that he was conceived of the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Now, here, as I need scarcely tell you, is again one of those great and difficult subjects,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   full of mystery, full of difficulty, a doctrine that has been much debated and argued about
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and misunderstood and frequently denied.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And people seem to derive, to find great difficulty about this doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   How, therefore, are we to approach it?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Well, there is nothing, it seems to me, more important as we approach this doctrine than this,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   that we should bear in mind everything that we've considered in all our previous lectures.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   I mean this.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   If you have agreed with me in what I've been saying in the previous twenty-three lectures,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   you should have no difficulty about the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   If you really have agreed about the doctrine of God and the doctrine of the Trinity,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   if you really have believed what I've said about the doctrine of the Scriptures
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   as being the infallible Word of God, in-breathed by the Holy Spirit, and not merely the ideas of men,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   if you've agreed with all that we said about the miracles and the supernatural
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and how all this is inevitable when God acts and deals with this world,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   well, then I say there really should be no difficulty and no trouble about the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   And it is, of course, a fact.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   The people who have difficulty with the doctrine of the virgin birth
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   are the same people who have difficulty with the doctrine of the Scripture,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   the same people who have difficulty with the doctrine of miracles.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   They're really in trouble about the doctrine of the Incarnation itself,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   because they set up their puny minds as the ultimate test of all truth.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And because they can't understand a thing, they won't believe it.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   But surely by now we must be in agreement that in all these matters
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   we are outside the realm of natural human reason and understanding.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   We started at the very beginning with the whole concept and category of revelation.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   We know nothing apart from revelation.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I don't stand here to put forward theories and philosophies.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I start on this premise that what I am announcing is what God has done, what God has revealed.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I know nothing apart from what I find in this book.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I am entirely shut up to this. I am utterly dependent upon it.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And therefore it is my business to come to it as a little child.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   The world by wisdom knew not God.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Well, very well then, if that was true and is still true, I must depend upon this.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I must accept its authority. I must receive its statements,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   even though my little mind can't always understand them.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Very well, that is, I say, the frame of mind and the appropriate attitude
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   to adopt as we come to consider this extraordinary and amazing and yet glorious doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   What does it teach? What are we told?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Well, I read to you those two portions of scripture at the beginning
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   because they are the basis of the doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You noticed the order in which I took them.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I always feel we should start with that statement in Luke
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   because it gives us the announcement of the great thing itself, to Mary.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And you remember the details in connection with that announcement.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You remember the facts. You remember how the angel came.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   You see, if you haven't agreed with my doctrine of angels, you're already in trouble.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   But if you did accept that doctrine of angels, well, there's no difficulty about this at all.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   It's what we'd expect.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And do you remember how we are told about Mary's surprise?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And Mary's surprise, of course, was something which was quite natural.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It's obvious, is it not, from her very surprise that she understood the significance of what the angel said to her.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Here is an unmarried woman, a virgin, to whom this announcement is made,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   and at once she sees the difficulty, and she doesn't hesitate to express her difficulty.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   The problem is, how can she be the mother of such a child while she has never known a man?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And the angel gives her the explanation.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   He announces to her that this is going to be something that is going to be done by the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   He tells her that she shall be overshadowed by the Almighty.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   The Holy Ghost, he says, shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Therefore also, that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   But then the account in the first chapter of Matthew, from verses 18 to 25,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   is equally important and surely equally interesting,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   because there we are told what happened to Joseph.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Joseph, discovering that this virgin to whom he was betrothed was with child,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   was confused and unhappy.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   He was a good man, he was a righteous man, he was a loving man.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   He decided he wouldn't make a public example of her, but he must have necessarily put her away,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   otherwise he wouldn't be keeping the law.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And he was meditating and pondering about all this himself as to how he could do it
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   when the angel appeared to him in a dream.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And what the angel did with Joseph, of course, was to explain again to him exactly what was happening.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   "Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take thee Mary thy wife,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   He is given exactly the same explanation.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And I'm afraid we often forget as we read that story to notice and to observe
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   the extraordinary faith of Joseph.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   He believed it, he accepted it without any demur, without any hesitation,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   and he proceeded to act upon it.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Now that is what we are told in the record.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   What does it mean?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Well, what it teaches us is this.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   That this work of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ as a man
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   is entirely the work of God.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   The doctrine of the virgin birth must always be considered first and foremost in a negative way.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And what it says negatively is this.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   That he had no earthly father.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   He was not born of the will of men or of the will or the energy of the flesh.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   At all.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Let me put it still more strongly.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   The male human being does not enter into the question of his conception or birth at all.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Now that's a very remarkable thing.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Because as we've seen already in working with the great doctrines at the beginning of the book of Genesis,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   the glory of God as it were is in the man and the woman is under the man, you remember.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   You remember how we worked that out.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   But here the man is put on one side.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   He has nothing to do with it.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   You notice that the very word, the promise that was given by God to the man and the woman
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   in the Garden of Gethsemane was this.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And so it proved to be.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   The man had nothing to do with it.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   The very one whom God had appointed Lord of creation,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   and to whom he gives power over the woman,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   and to whom the woman is subject by God's own decree and ordination as the result of creation,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   and especially as the result of the fall.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   In spite of all that, when it comes to the question of the incarnation,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   the male is put on one side,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and God uses the woman only.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And surely the significance and the importance of that must be quite obvious to all of us.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   It is to emphasize again the total inability of men.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Man as such is seen in his utter failure and incapacity in the person of Joseph.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And God takes hold of human nature at its weakest and at its lowest as it were,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   in order to produce ultimate this human nature for his own son.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Now I've come across a very beautiful phrase which I'm going to pass on to you,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   which I think will help you to remember this.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Here it is.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "As our Lord's divine nature had no mother, so his human nature had no father."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I think that puts it very well.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   "As our Lord's divine nature had no mother, so his human nature had no father."
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It was entirely the work of God.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   He took on him human nature from Mary.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   But it was done, you remember, through the instrumentality of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   "What happened?" says someone.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   "I can't answer."
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   "No one can answer."
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That is the great mystery.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   But what we know is this,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   that the power of the Holy Spirit came upon Mary,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and out of Mary, out of a cell in her body,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   the human nature of our Lord was made.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   We can't go further.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   It's a great mystery.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   But we have to go as far as that.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   It was this operation of the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and it was obviously done in such a way
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   that this human nature that he took unto himself was sinless.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   You notice the angel tells Mary that this holy thing,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   this sinless, this pure thing which shall be born of thee.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   So the operation was worked in that way.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Now it doesn't mean that Mary herself was made sinless and holy.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It doesn't even imply of necessity that any part of Mary was.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   All we know is this,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   that something was taken and was cleansed,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   rendered free from all pollution,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   so that his human nature was sinless and entirely free
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   from all the effects and the results of the fall.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Such was the effect of the operation of the Holy Spirit upon her.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Now then, what of this doctrine?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   What are we to say about it in general,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   especially having in mind those who find it difficult?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Well, I would suggest once more that it's a doctrine
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   which seems to me to be quite inevitable.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   If you really do believe the doctrine of the incarnation,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   if you really do believe that that babe in the manger in Bethlehem
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   is the second person in the blessed holy trinity,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and that is the truth,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   then I cannot see that there is any difficulty about this doctrine of the virgin birth.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Indeed, I would find myself in much greater difficulty
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   if I didn't have the doctrine of the virgin birth to believe.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   What I mean by that is this,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   that the fact of the incarnation is so unusual,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   it's so exceptional, it's so miraculous, it's so mysterious,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   that I would expect everything about him to be the same,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and so it proves to be.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   The virgin birth, if you like, therefore,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   is the sign of the mystery of the incarnation.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It's the kind of sign of the mystery.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   You can't get at the mystery.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   This is a kind of sign or symbol of that mystery.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   There it is in a tangible form, this virgin birth.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   The whole thing is mysterious,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   but that is the kind of external sign of the mystery.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Oh, everything about our Lord is mysterious.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   His coming into the world was mysterious, His going out of it was mysterious.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   He didn't enter into life like anybody else, He didn't go out of it like anybody else.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   The resurrection is as unique as the virgin birth, quite as unique.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It has never happened to anybody before.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He is the first begotten from the dead,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   He is the first born amongst many brethren.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   The resurrection is equally startling.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   So that I would say to anybody who stumbles at the virgin birth,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   do you stumble in the same way at the resurrection?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You see, if we start with the doctrine of the incarnation
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and realize what we are saying,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   and realize that we are really speaking about this second person
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   well then I say, surely you would expect His birth to be entirely unusual and exceptional.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And so it was.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   He is exceptional from beginning to end.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   It is something quite different.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   But let me try and help you by putting it in this form.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   If you do not believe in the doctrine of the virgin birth,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   how then do you account for His sinlessness?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   How do you account for the fact that He was without sin?
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Are we not entitled to put it like this?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   If He had been born in the ordinary way of a father and a mother,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   then surely He would have been an ordinary person like every other person.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And if He had been a person like every other person,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   He would have been in direct sequence in the direct line from Adam.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And therefore it would be true to say that as in Adam all die,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   He would have died in Adam.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   He would have been guilty of original sin and of original guilt.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   But you see, the doctrine of the incarnation at once tells us that that is not what happened.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   A person, I say, did not come into being there.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   The person is the eternal person.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   The second person in the blessed holy trinity.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   When a husband and a wife come together and a child is born,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   a new person, a new personality comes into being.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   That did not happen in the incarnation.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   But given father and mother, you get a person,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   and that person, I say, in the direct line from Adam,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   therefore sinful, therefore fallen.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And He would no longer be sinless.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   The only way that one could answer that would be this.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Would be to say that some similar kind of operation as was performed by the Holy Spirit on Mary,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   should also be performed on Joseph.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   But surely that doesn't help us.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   If you are already in difficulties and in trouble about this miraculous operation on Mary,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   well now you are doubling it.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   You are asking for two instead of one and it is still more impossible.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   No, no, my friends.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   If we really take a firm hold of the doctrine of the incarnation itself,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   that this blessed person took unto himself a human nature that had to be sinful,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   otherwise he couldn't have united with it.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   He couldn't unite with anything that was sinful.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Well then there was only one way for it.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And that is that he should have been born, not in the ordinary way of generation,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   but in this special way.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   You notice the whole doctrine is surrounded by pitfalls and difficulties.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   When I put it like that, I am sure that many of you are thinking in your minds,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   "Ah, I see, God created a special human nature for him, did he?"
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   No, he didn't. I have already denounced that as heresy.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He got his human nature from Mary,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   but it was acted upon by the Holy Spirit in such a way that it was rendered holy,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   free from sin and from all pollution.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   And so we stand again before him.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   We stand before this mystery of godliness.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   God in the flesh, the strangest, the most amazing,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   the most astounding thing that has ever happened.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yea, I don't hesitate to say this supreme act of God,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   and so supreme that I expect it to be unusual in every respect.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And I find the scriptures tell me that it was.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   He was concealed of the Holy Ghost.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   He was born of a virgin named Mary.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Man is entirely excluded. The male doesn't come in.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Joseph is there ever to remind us of that.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   It is entirely the work of God.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And as we part, do we all realize and remember
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   that it all happened and it all took place.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Not that a phenomenon might enter into this world,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   but that you and I might be saved,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   that your sins and mine might be forgiven.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   The Son of God became the Son of men.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   That sons of men might become sons of God.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
