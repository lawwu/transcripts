[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Jesus was sinless.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, says Peter.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And he remains sinless even to this day. In him there is no sin, says John.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   This glorious truth forms the basis of his substitutionary atoning work for sinners like you and me.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But his sinlessness also forms the basis of why he is qualified to sympathize with us, his sinners.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And on that point comes a controversy.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   If Jesus is sinless, doesn't that mean he never really tasted the power of temptation?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   How can a perfect man who never sinned, a man who never struggled to get free from a sin habit,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   how can he truly feel the power of temptation?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   But this line of thinking is quite wrong. It's wrong because you're not struggling with sin
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   if you're continually giving into sin.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   In other words, the pressure of temptation is felt most strongly by those who most earnestly resist giving into the sin.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And if that point sounds familiar, it should.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   We've covered that theme several times on the podcast already, particularly in episodes on lust,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   like APJ episodes 291, 804, and 963 come to mind.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The pressure of temptation is felt most strongly by those who most earnestly resist giving into the sin.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Pastor John explains in this clip from a 1996 sermon.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I apologize for about a minute of static in the middle of it, but the clip is just too good
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and the point is too important not to share here on the podcast.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Here's Pastor John, 25 years ago, preaching on Hebrews chapter 4, verse 15,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   a text that tells us our high priest can sympathize with our weakness because he never sinned.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   With the Father, it was the Son who entered in as high priest.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Now look at verse 15.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   In spite of the fact that verse 14 presents a magnificent and lofty great high priest,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   verse 14, I mean 15, describes him in another way.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Notice three things.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   One, he was tempted like you are.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Two, he never gave in to temptation, never sinned.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And three, he is very sympathetic with us in our weaknesses.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Fifty years ago, C.S. Lewis was pondering this text and he heard an objection raised by a scoffer.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And the objection went like this, "If Jesus never sinned, he can't know what real temptation is like.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He can't sympathize, he can't empathize with me because he's never tasted the full force of temptation."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And this is what C.S. Lewis wrote in response.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   "A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   This is an obvious lie.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   A man who gives in to temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And I might add, or a lifetime later, of hanging in there with a tough marriage and resisting the temptation to bail out.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Or of hanging in there against sexual temptation and resisting the temptation,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   not just five minutes or one hour, but year in, year out, decade in, decade out, until Jesus comes or calls.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   You talk about knowing the force and power of temptation.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Only those who do that know the full force.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And so, Lewis says, "That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation means.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The only complete realist."
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Don't you ever think that because you have lived a life of sin,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   that you know more about temptation than the godly person who has walked that razor's edge of the straight and narrow,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   gritting his teeth in the power of the Holy Spirit and saying, "No! No! No! No!"
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And fighting his way through every day with righteousness and laying his head down
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and feeling the force of evil upon him day after day after day and triumphing over him in God.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Don't you ever think that you know more of evil than that person or that you know more of evil than Jesus Christ.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Tempted as we are, yet without sin, and therefore knowing the full force of what it is to be tempted.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Let me illustrate for you.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Jesus was tempted to lie to save His life.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Would you not, surrounded by soldiers, spears, a cross in the corner, nails on the floor, hammers over there,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   having seen what it was like when they asked you, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the living God?"
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Be tempted to lie.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   He was tempted to steal to help His mother when His father died. I do not doubt.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   There were at least five kids in that family.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Widows don't make it easy. Joseph disappears off the scene early.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Jesus was tempted to steal.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Jesus was tempted to covet all those things, those nice things that He has had, even after He gave away half His goods.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He was a rich man.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And Jesus walked out owning nothing.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You would think He was not tempted to covet His own home, a place to lay His head down every night.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   He was tempted to dishonor His parents when they were tough on Him,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and told Him what was right and wrong, and set limits, perhaps more than the other boys in Nazareth.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   He was tempted to take revenge when He was wrongly accused.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So often they said lies about Him, and with one word He could have made fools out of them.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   He was tempted to lust when Mary knelt down, leaned over, and wiped His feet with her hair.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   He was tempted to murmur at God's sovereignty when His friend and colleague and brother,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   John the Baptist, was beheaded at the whim of a dancing girl. Where are you, God?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   He was tempted to gloat over His accusers when they couldn't answer His questions.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He knew the battle, folks, and He triumphed over that monster every day, all day, for 33 years.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And when it crescendoed at the end, He never, ever gave in.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Now let me close by pointing you to verse 16.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   The conclusion that we draw from all of this, that we have a great High Priest,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   that He is the Son of God, that He has passed through the heavens with God,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   that He is sympathetic with us, the conclusion to draw is that we can draw near to God for grace.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Let me pose a problem as we close that has kept many people away from Jesus.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And I want to make sure nobody falls for this.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Because there are so many people, I've talked to so many, I've heard of so many,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   who they get to the crisis point of whether to embrace Christ as their High Priest,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   their Savior, their Lord, their King, their Guide, their Friend, and they push it away.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Here's why. Many of them do.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Everybody in this room knows that you need help.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We need help with our bodies. We need help with our minds.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   We need help with our jobs. We need help with our spouses.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   We need help with our kids. We need help with our finances.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We need help with our choices. Everybody knows we need help.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And there's a second thing everybody in this room knows, in your most honest moments,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   you don't deserve help.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   John Piper doesn't deserve any help from anybody.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Why? I'm a sinner. I deserve one thing, judgment.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I don't deserve help, so here I am.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I need help to live my life and cope with eternity, and I don't deserve help.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Now what are you going to do?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   This is the trap that keeps many people away from Christ.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   You've got maybe three or four options. Here's number one.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   You can deny it all and say, "I'll be a superman or a superwoman and rise above my need for help."
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And that might last a year, a decade, and then you break.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Or you could say, "I can't deny it all, but I can drown it all,"
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and you throw your life into a pool of sensual pleasure.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's a possibility.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   The third option is very common.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   It's looking, "I need help with my life. My life doesn't work. I'm not in control.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I especially can't handle my sin and my eternity, and over here, I don't deserve help.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   There's nobody owes me anything because I'm a sinner.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I have wrecked things so many times, and my attitude stinks, and I don't love God the way I should."
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Paralysis and hopelessness.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And you present the gospel to a person like that, if they don't have ears to hear,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   they just say, "There's no way. There's no hope for me."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   But now there's a fourth option, and that's what the Bible is about.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   That's what history of Israel is about.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That's what this text is about, and the option is, there is a high priest
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   who is the Son of God, who takes the blood of His own death into the presence of God,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   and He enables us to say, "Yes, I need help. Yes, I don't deserve it.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   But no, I will not be paralyzed because there is a mediator,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and Jesus came to give the undeserving help."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   What do you call that?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   The throne of grace. Say it again.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   The throne of grace is God meeting the need of undeserving people.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You've got to hear that now. I want you to take that out of here in about one minute.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Grace comes into your life when you are paralyzed with the sense that you need help,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and you don't deserve help, and therefore you feel hopeless,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and you're either going to superman it out or drown it out or be paralyzed with depression.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And grace comes in and says, "Yes, you've analyzed that rightly. You need help.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yes, you've analyzed that rightly. You don't deserve a thing from God.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But no, you don't need to be a superman. No, you don't need to drown it.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And no, you don't need to be paralyzed."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   The fourth option is, "I paid for that sin, and while you don't deserve any help,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   God will give you help if you come through a high priest."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   So good. That clip is from Pastor John's sermon on September 15, 1996,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   titled "Draw Near to the Throne of Grace with Confidence."
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   It was sent to us by Caleb from London, Ontario.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Caleb writes, "I recently listened to this sermon, and this selection especially stood out to me,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   seeing how Jesus was tempted not at a singular time by the devil,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   but he has been tempted in every way and throughout his entire life."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That point and the rest of the clip is a big encouragement to me in my fight against temptation myself.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Amen. Thank you, Caleb.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And thank you for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Our clips are crowdsourced.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   On Friday, we end the week talking about providence.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   We started the week talking about providence and explaining the pains of life to children.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Next up, a question from a grieving young woman, a new believer and a listener to the podcast
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   who is really struggling to process a very deep pain that has come into her life.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   That's the topic on Friday.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I'm your host, Amir Renki.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   We are joined in studio again with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   We'll see you then.
