[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.320]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.760]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.760]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:22.680]   Today I want to share with you why I do not believe moving around is conducive to wealth.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.680]   Now you'll notice that I'm giving myself quite a broad scope of conversation here.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.400]   By moving around I mean traveling a lot, but I also mean just frequently moving around.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.280]   And in today's episode you can basically consider this a report from me, your intrepid
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   experimenter, your intrepid investigator, about what I've learned of moving around
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.640]   a lot and trying on some, shall we say, alternative lifestyles and how I think that those things
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.860]   impact wealth.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.200]   My thesis is simply that moving around is not conducive to wealth for the vast majority
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   of people.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.360]   I want to leave a small caveat here for the point that moving around might be helpful
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.760]   to wealth for those who take jobs because changing jobs on an appropriately frequent
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.980]   schedule or going to places where there are jobs that pay highly can actually be a pretty
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.000]   decent strategy.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720]   So this is from the professional, on the professional level, right, maybe you're a turnaround specialist
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.060]   that goes in and takes command of a failing company, works there for two years, fixes
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.640]   the major problems and then that company is sold.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.040]   That might be a very highly profitable job.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.020]   It could also be the case at the low end of the income scale.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.960]   There are people who only work during certain times of the year on a seasonal basis, but
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.520]   the seasonal labor that they do is actually pretty highly paid.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.800]   So during the summer they might work as a concessionaire with a local fair of some kind
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.240]   or a carnival.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.560]   Then they might go and sell Christmas trees for a time and then take several months off.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.240]   None of their jobs would be enough on an annual basis to support them, but because they're
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.440]   seasonal and they're moving around for that work, they can be highly paid jobs.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.880]   There are various ways that you can apply that.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.920]   But on the whole, I think that instability of location, moving around a lot, whether
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.000]   it's short term, medium term travel, as well as just simply moving is bad for wealth.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.240]   I want to tell you why in a little bit from my own experiences.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.040]   For context, I lived for the first 30 plus years of my life a very stable existence.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.800]   I lived in one town, we moved once or twice that I remember, but not frequently.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.080]   I lived in one town in South Florida my entire lifetime.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   I went to school in that same town, elementary school, high school, college.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.680]   I built businesses and had jobs in that town.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   Because I lived that continual settled lifestyle, I was kind of like the fish in water, meaning
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   I didn't see the advantages that were accruing to me from that stable lifestyle, from that
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   settledness.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   It was only after I started to lose those advantages that I became more aware of them.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.440]   Take a fish out of water and he quickly understands, "Hey, the water was really nice.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.040]   That was where I could breathe."
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.560]   Take a man out of a town where he's been stable and all of a sudden he starts to realize,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   "Wow, I lost out on a whole bunch of things that I couldn't make work because I'm not
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.840]   in that same place where I know how everything is done."
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.320]   That moving around has involved a few different expressions.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.760]   It's involved living in rentals, it's involved getting rid of ... My wife and I, we had a
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.120]   home, we had a stable lifestyle.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.320]   Then we decided to give that up.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.900]   We moved into a rental apartment.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.920]   Then we decided to get rid of the rental apartment, move into an RV.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.440]   We RV'd around the United States.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   Then we decided to get rid of the RV, downsize more, jump in some suitcases and travel around
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080]   the world.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.160]   We bounced around the world, set up a couple of rental houses.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.080]   Then we decided we would go travel again.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   This whole experience culminated with our adventures of 2020, excuse me, 2021, wherein
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.760]   we became full-time digital nomads in June, March, April, May, June, July, August, all
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   the way through.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.880]   We spent about six months living as full-time digital nomads with nothing but literally
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480]   six personal item under seat suitcases and one backpack.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.680]   Let me begin by telling you honestly how I felt about it.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.840]   I loved it.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.120]   I absolutely loved it.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.520]   Kind of that hardcore moving around, full-time digital nomad, just a set of small suitcases,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.180]   which means we can get into any rental car, get into any bus, get in any airplane, setting
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.180]   off with nothing.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.180]   We had no rental house.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.600]   We had no owned house.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.500]   We had no mortgage, no nothing.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.600]   I loved it.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.920]   I have never felt freer in my whole life than I did during that period in 2021 when we were
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.720]   full-time digital nomads, going from Airbnb, Central America, Europe, all around, Airbnbs,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   hotels, et cetera.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.240]   I felt amazing during that time, amazingly free.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.940]   I felt like we could enjoy all kinds of cool experiences.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.240]   We could do fun things, have all kinds of great cultural experiences.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.760]   I felt like we could literally go anywhere.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.000]   We booked the whole trip with one-way tickets all along the way.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.760]   I was just booking them as we went.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   I felt like, "Hey, tomorrow we're going to go to Asia.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.000]   Tomorrow we want to go to Europe.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.600]   Tomorrow we're ready to go."
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.720]   It was amazing.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.980]   There were also a whole long set of challenges that made it not as amazing as I'd always
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.360]   hoped that it was going to be.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.500]   That's where we get to the meat of what I want to talk about.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.160]   For background, I want you to know that when I accomplished that goal this last year in
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:29.080]   2021 of basically six months of digital nomading, it was in many ways the culmination of almost
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   a 15-year goal.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.480]   I remember back in the mid-2000s, I was working at a corporate job.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.220]   During my slacking time, I would read blogs.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.080]   Some of those blogs were written by young digital nomads.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.440]   Some of the unique things that they were doing at the time was to say, "Hey, look.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.320]   I only own the things that are in my backpack."
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.560]   This came out when I was paying attention to the minimalist space.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.820]   It was, "Hey, I only own 100 things," or, "Everything I own fits in my backpack."
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:08.260]   There was a foundation of people who were gaining notoriety by moving frequently.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.000]   There were remote web workers who would pick a new country every three months and move
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.580]   every 90 days.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.680]   Or there were guys like Benny the Irish polyglot who would say, "Hey, I move every three months
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.120]   and learn a new language every 90 days."
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.160]   I was enamored by the ideas of what that lifestyle could entail because for me, traveling had
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.280]   always been a source of joy, of great pleasure.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   I loved it.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.680]   I thought, "Wow, what if I could do that as a lifestyle?"
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.120]   When I accomplished that in 2021, it felt pretty cool.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.520]   It wasn't a major goal.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.600]   It wasn't something I said, "I want to do now, now."
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.320]   I just woke up and said, "Hey, here's a chance for me to do it."
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.880]   I think the big difference, of course, that I want to acknowledge between the Joshua of
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.920]   2006 and the Joshua of 2021 is that the Joshua of 2006 was a single adult male.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.040]   The Joshua of 2021 was a married father of four young children.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.680]   But my wife and I are intrepid adventurers at heart, and we're not scared of a challenge,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.240]   and we decided to do it even so.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   I'm glad we did.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:18.220]   What I want to report to you as an outcome of that trip is it's not all that it's cracked
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.680]   up to be.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.760]   I think that most people find this to be the case.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   In fact, if I went back and I went through the list of so many people who have become
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.880]   full-time digital nomads, the vast majority of them are no longer doing it several years
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.640]   later because it sounds romantic, it seems wonderful, and there are many wonderful things
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.480]   about it.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.440]   But then you start to realize there's a lot of embedded wisdom in the traditional lifestyle
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.040]   that I didn't understand before.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.960]   There are some things that I didn't recognize how important they were, and it's only when
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   you lose those things or miss those things that you start to understand.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.200]   In some ways, this has been the experience I've had time and time again.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:12.360]   You have this young, brash, aggressive desire to minimize the wisdom of the old ways, and
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.440]   then you go and you try your fresh radical ideas, and all of a sudden you realize, "You
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   know what?
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.080]   There was a lot of embodied wisdom, and there was a lot of—I don't have a better word
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.680]   than wisdom—there was a lot of embodied wisdom in the old ways, and now I understand
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.880]   more of the wisdom behind those ways, why that emerged the way that it is."
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.840]   Let's talk about some of the costs of moving around frequently.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:51.080]   When I think about costs, I think about costs to my income, and I think about costs to my
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.080]   expenses.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.560]   Let's begin with the most aggressive of moving around frequently, which is traveling.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:08.600]   I worked hard, I have worked hard, and I have succeeded in developing a really, really good
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:15.400]   mobile office, a really good, productive mobile setup.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.000]   For most of us, a computer and a cell phone is pretty much all you need.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.160]   A computer that can grab a local Wi-Fi signal if you have it, and a cell phone to create
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.240]   a Wi-Fi signal for that computer if you don't.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:34.440]   We are so blessed to live in the age of connectedness, where it's easy to travel the world and be
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.420]   on the grid at virtually all times, and for remote workers, for those of us who make a
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.520]   living through communication, this is powerful.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.560]   I've been so fortunate, and I have loved working in so many interesting locations, and it's
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.640]   amazing to be able to sit down virtually anywhere, pop open a computer, put your cell phone there
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.760]   on the table, tether the two together, and boom, you're at work.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.200]   It's incredible.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.760]   You can get very high-speed connections, you can get 5G, very high data limits.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   It's wonderful.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.560]   Now, my job involves a little bit more gear, not too much.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.640]   I, on occasion, do create podcasts directly from my phone, just like all of us create
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.960]   videos directly from our phone, et cetera, but I carry a little bit more professional
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   gear.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.400]   But I've done all kinds of stuff with just what fits in my backpack.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.520]   I have an amazing podcasting setup that allows me to have high-quality microphones and to
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.880]   do live Q&A shows using my cell phone and my computer and just the little pieces of
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.240]   gear that I carry with me.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.360]   I've got a great camera.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.280]   I've got all of the cool stuff that works really, really well.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:52.020]   The problem is not having a simple stability of where you work is a much bigger drag than
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.060]   you might think.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.800]   The question is always, "Where can I find internet today and how fast is it?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.720]   Is it actually usably fast or is it just okay, good enough?"
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   Finding internet, you'd think, is pretty easy and in some ways it is, but then there's all
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.600]   these little things that crop up.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.100]   Where can I find internet where I can also be left alone to focus or where will it be
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.800]   quiet enough for me to do my work or where will I be allowed to sit and actually do it?
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.760]   Let me share a few rather humorous stories with you to prove this point.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   To me, one of the most memorable for me happened near Thermopolis, Idaho during my family's
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   RV wanderings around the United States.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:47.640]   The way that we handled my work during our RVing days was that when we were moving the
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.200]   RV, when we were traveling from one place to another, I would usually do about a half
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   day's worth of work.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.080]   The rhythm that we found worked well for us with having three young children at the time
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.440]   was to get up in the morning, have breakfast, and then after breakfast, break, camp, hook
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:11.840]   up and then drive from somewhere around usually 9 o'clock, 9.30, 10 o'clock to around noon,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.400]   12.30, 1 o'clock, do about three hours of driving.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.480]   There were many days where we did long marathon days, but we couldn't get anything else done
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.040]   on those days except drive.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.640]   So a three-hour drive was really a nice fit for us.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.320]   Check out of one campground, check into another.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.600]   But then that meant that I needed to get to work.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.020]   So usually we would get to a campground.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.080]   Our children's nap time is right around 1 o'clock and we're pretty committed nappers.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.560]   So the goal was always to be in a campground set up by 1 o'clock, if at all possible, so
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.400]   that the children could nap.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.920]   And then I would grab my gear and I would go and work.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.200]   And I would work for about three hours from say 1 to 4, 1 to 5, then we'd go on a walk,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.840]   prepare dinner, etc.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.180]   And then that would just be a half day's work or a few hours of work on those travel days.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.200]   There was a problem though.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.840]   I was finding that we were having more days where we were traveling, because we were traveling
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.240]   fast and there were more days when we were doing fun things and I wasn't getting as much
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.680]   work done as I wanted to get done.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.400]   And so I was feeling a little stressed.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.240]   By the time we got to Idaho, I was feeling a lot stressed.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.440]   And so we got to this little campground just south of Thermopolis, Idaho.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.440]   And the goal was that afternoon to go up to the hot springs in Thermopolis.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720]   So we set up the camper and everything's good.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.240]   It's a fairly quiet campground.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.880]   I parked the trailer.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.320]   My wife starts getting the children to bed.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:45.720]   I grab my gear and I make a beeline across the campground for an empty picnic table.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.760]   And I think, "I've got it made.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.600]   I can create a podcast all day while I'm driving around.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   I'm thinking of the podcast.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   I got the whole outline.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   I'm ready to go."
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   So I sit down, pull up my computer, pull up my microphone, set up my recorder.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Everything's ready to go.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   And I hit record.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   "Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:06.440]   And I'm about three or four minutes in and the sprinklers come on right in the middle
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.800]   of the day, one o'clock.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.960]   And I start getting whacked with a sprinkler.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.080]   And I'm making a mad dash to get my computer closed and get my recorder closed and grab
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.640]   my phone and all the stuff off the table, trying to shield it with my body from the
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.760]   sprinkler spray, feeling totally disillusioned, just saying, "What on earth am I going to
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   do?
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.200]   How am I going to make this happen?
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.300]   I thought working was going to be great."
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.900]   And it was great until it wasn't.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.080]   And so I found it was a continual problem of, yeah, I could sit out under a picnic table,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   but it was too hot.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   And I was sitting and sweating.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.760]   Or it was too sunny and I couldn't see the screen.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   Or it was too cold.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   It was too windy.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.080]   It was just always something with the external environment was difficult.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.280]   I'll come back and tell you at the end of the show how I solved that because there are
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.500]   solutions for these things.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.480]   So whether it's an external weather problem or maybe it's something where you say, "Okay,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.800]   I've got a better solution."
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.440]   Very little, only some of my work involves actually creating audio.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.800]   Where when I create audio or video, I need to actually have a good environment around
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   me.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.920]   But a lot of times I just need to pop up on my computer and have an internet signal just
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.800]   like anybody else.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800]   And so this happened a few months ago.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.560]   We were in Savannah, Georgia, passing through Savannah.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.160]   And we had a couple of days and my wife was good.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.220]   We'd rented a nice home.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.500]   Everything was good at home so I could go and work.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.160]   And I went to the local library.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.400]   And I felt very rich being in the United States because there are libraries everywhere and
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.000]   they've got these big tables and you've got a great internet signal.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.760]   They're quiet and you can work.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.320]   It's like I could build a multi-million dollar business just sitting in the library.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   It's wonderful.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.840]   So I go to the library and I'm sitting in Savannah, Georgia and I'm getting all this
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.360]   kind of work done.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.680]   Get in there around 10 o'clock when they open and it's around I think 12, just after 12,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.680]   12-15.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.900]   Somebody comes and taps me on the shoulder and they say, "You have to go."
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900]   I have to go?
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.900]   I'm just getting started, right?
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   It's a public library.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.580]   I'm planning to be here until 5 o'clock.
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:11.980]   Well, no, we have COVID time limits where due to COVID, you're not allowed to be here
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.180]   for more than two hours.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:21.220]   You're sitting there saying, "Well, does the virus like I've breathed out enough of the
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.940]   virus and in enough of the virus in two hours that it should be fine?
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.280]   Like wouldn't it make more sense to have occupation limits?"
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.760]   But no, it's time limits.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.140]   Okay, fine.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.960]   So then you're back in it and you say, "Where am I going to go?
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.520]   Where do I go to sit and work?"
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.880]   And it's really annoying, but all of a sudden you face, because of your kind of transient
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.680]   lifestyle, you face this silly challenge of a COVID time limit at a public library.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.480]   So the solution to this is of course to establish better options, better solutions.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.360]   So you rent co-working spaces.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.820]   The co-working spaces are amazing, except that sometimes co-working spaces don't have
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.820]   all that you need.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.820]   Right?
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.720]   This summer we were in Malta and I rented, we were there for a while.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.540]   We wanted to see all the stuff and tour all the sites and swim in the sea and we didn't
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.540]   want to travel fast.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:15.360]   And so I rented, I took out a month-long pass at a local co-working facility and it was
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360]   wonderful.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   It was a beautiful office.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   It was very affordable.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.560]   It was 600 bucks or something like that for the month's pass.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   And it was just going to be great.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.600]   So they had a gym, they had a common area, everything was great.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.080]   And then I needed to record video.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.000]   And so I had a plan all set up where I'm going to record a bunch of videos.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.560]   I'm going to come in on Saturday when the office is empty because I got these really
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.120]   beautiful locations and it's going to be wonderful.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.440]   So I'll come in on Saturday to do it.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.800]   Well, you come in on Saturday and all of a sudden other people have the same idea.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.200]   And so you don't have enough control over your surroundings to actually get things done.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.720]   And I can't record videos at home because of the noise level in the home.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.680]   I can't record videos in a common space because of respect for other people.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.720]   And so you're frustrated, right?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.520]   You thought you had it and yet all of a sudden you don't.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:06.140]   And so there's always challenges of finding and setting up an appropriate work environment.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.200]   And then even there's the little hassles.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.560]   They don't seem like much, right?
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.560]   The time spent packing and unpacking your stuff.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.120]   It doesn't seem like much of a hassle.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.880]   But what happens is it often takes time to get into a state of flow where everything's
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.520]   just simply working.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.280]   And the more friction there is between you and flow, the harder it is to regularly get
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.760]   into flow.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.320]   And so you want to minimize that friction.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.800]   And the simple things of packing up and unpacking, firing up and shutting down, et cetera, is
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.840]   all these little annoyances that kind of mess with your brain and make it harder to get
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.020]   into your state of flow.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.700]   Other big, big challenge.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.200]   It's extremely difficult to schedule your future work properly.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.640]   Now some things are like time zones.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.480]   Time zones are actually really not as hard as they once were in terms of getting them
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.480]   right.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.360]   All of our devices, our calendar apps, everything works really well with time zones now.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.800]   What I do is I pick a time zone that I live on.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.240]   The time zone that I live on is East Coast time because it's just a big standard time
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   zone.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.440]   And then I schedule everything in terms of East Coast time.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.640]   And then by making sure that I'm careful whenever I put calendar appointments in, et cetera,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.480]   I put the time zone in properly.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.880]   And then the phone and everything just figures it out for me and it keeps me on track.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.400]   The challenge is, well, what if you move all of a sudden last second?
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.800]   And then what if today there's a market or a beautiful festival or something?
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.520]   Well, rats, I scheduled that at the wrong time and now I can't get that thing done.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.560]   Or more difficult and much bigger deal is where am I going to be able to get my deep
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.080]   focus work done?
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:51.040]   I've had a long string of classes and courses that I have planned to create and release.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.000]   Several of these have been collaborative.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.680]   Some of them have been on my own.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.160]   And what has happened is every time I was sure that I was going to schedule my month
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.840]   in this place and I was going to have the location that I needed to perform that long
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.760]   work of recording the videos, recording the audio, recording the classes, all of a sudden
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.520]   something would happen and I wasn't able to do it.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.920]   And that's really frustrating because it affects your income and it affects your ability to
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.120]   actually do the work because there are times when you need to do the really important work
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.400]   and you don't do that sitting on a beach, getting sand in your keyboard, scratching
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.560]   up your screen, picking up mosquitoes.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.760]   Nobody works on a beach with a laptop.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.840]   And so the stuff piles up, right?
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.840]   You can hear even the tension and the frustration in my own voice as I just simply tell you
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.400]   the stories.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.980]   And then another challenge to your income, it's hard to maintain your energy when you're
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.400]   moving around a lot.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.560]   Traveling and dealing with logistics and the fresh decisions every day is very tiring.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.660]   It's very tiring to be moving a lot and figuring out where do I go.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.920]   So the best way to handle this is of course slow travel.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:03.040]   But then when you're doing slower travel, then you wonder, "Shouldn't I get better
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.540]   digs?"
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.600]   It's one thing to pop down to the hotel lobby and have a good couple of productive hours
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.000]   sitting in the restaurant or in the side of the lobby.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.040]   That's great.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.380]   But then doing that every single day, week after week, it's old.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:23.000]   And so if you're going to be moving more slowly, you want to have a solution.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.800]   That's where, again, the coworking space comes in.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.600]   You rent a month at a coworking space, but then the coworking space isn't good enough
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.720]   and you really wish for the benefits of your own private office.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.480]   You wish for the ability to take a call without having to step outside and walk around in
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:42.080]   circles or without having to schedule the Skype room in advance.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.640]   All the little stuff just simply adds up.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.000]   So my point is that you can generate income while traveling around.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And I'm so blessed.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.280]   You're so blessed.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.320]   We're all fortunate to live in the time and age in which we do.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.440]   What happens is after you get past the initial excitement, some of these little things really
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.000]   wear on you.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:13.040]   And you realize that for me to operate at my best, I need to have good infrastructure
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   set up.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.800]   I need to have good infrastructure set up.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.280]   So can you solve these things?
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.440]   Yes, you can solve them, which is where we move on to the expenses, the expenses of moving
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.400]   around a lot.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.360]   The challenge is when you solve them, you start spending extra money, a lot of money
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.440]   sometimes, for suboptimal solutions.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.920]   And I'll work my way through some of the solutions that really do work.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.240]   They really do.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.480]   But yet sometimes you wonder, "Is this really what I want to do?"
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.600]   So when you don't have consistent internet, meaning a good stable home network or good
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.100]   stable office environment, then you need to have backups.
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.160]   So I have multiple cell phones and I have multiple cell phone plans from multiple regions
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   of the world.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.160]   Why?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.360]   Well, because I want to make sure that I always have what I need.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.240]   I make money from a phone.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.640]   And so it's not a luxury for me to say, "Oh, I have two phones."
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.760]   It's a tool.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.960]   And no carpenter would have a single hammer.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.920]   No electrician would have a single pair of wire cutters.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.400]   You need something as a backup.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:26.520]   And so when you make money from your phone and from your computer, you have backups.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.120]   And I have multiple levels of backups.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.960]   But that adds expense and it adds hassle.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.460]   And the reality is none of those backups work as well as the traditional model.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:43.920]   If I have my own office, I can put in a high-speed fiber optic, whatever, bazillion gigabyte
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.240]   connection and a really good high-quality stable network.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.360]   I don't need to have backup after backup of a cell phone.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.640]   And everything would work great.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.400]   And I could get online and I could do wonderful video conferences and I could do great YouTube
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.480]   lives and it would all just work.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.360]   But you have to wind up maintaining multiple cell phones, multiple cell phone plans, knowing
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.880]   to carry them around.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.480]   It's a hassle to use them and they're always suboptimal.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   They're never great.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.040]   They're just good enough.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.000]   They get the job done most of the time, barely good enough.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.300]   And then that moves out, right?
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.520]   Other expenses.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:24.660]   With traveling a lot, you think, "Okay, I'm going to be here in this certain place."
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:30.780]   But every single time I have been here in a certain place, I've wound up leaving early.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.480]   So I rent a place for a month in a co-working space and then three weeks in, we decide to
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   leave.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.800]   I rent a place for multiple months on Airbnb thinking, "Okay, we're going to be stationary,"
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   and then I leave early.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.160]   And so you're always leaving little money on the table, which on the whole, it's not
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.040]   that big of a deal, but it adds up.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   It adds up.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   It adds up.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.860]   And you're annoyed because now you're spending extra money, but it's not actually getting
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.160]   you a great solution.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.900]   It's barely getting you an adequate solution.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.160]   And that's annoying.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160]   You need quiet, right?
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   I need quiet.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160]   And so what do I do?
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   I always rent a second hotel room.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:10.280]   And so I have one hotel room that is for us, and the other second hotel room is my office.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   And that's fine.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.280]   You can do it.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   It works.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.480]   But again, it's annoying when it doesn't work well.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.520]   And you think, "If only I just had one office.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.760]   If I just had one stationary office where everything worked, imagine what I could get
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.200]   done."
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.960]   You could solve the solutions in other ways, right?
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.680]   I told you I'd tell you how I solved my problem when we were on our RV trip.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.520]   I bought two RVs, and I had a second RV.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.880]   And so the original plan, I had a pickup truck, and we had a travel trailer, a bumper pull
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   travel trailer.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.200]   That was what we started with.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.640]   But after the sprinkler incident south of Thermopolis, Idaho, I went and I bought an
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   in-bed truck camper, and that was my office.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.160]   And so I bought a second RV, put it on the pickup truck, and that way we would have our
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.040]   house and we would have an office.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.640]   And so then I could get out of the sun, out of the wind, out of the cold, out of the heat,
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.480]   out of the sprinklers, and I could drive my truck somewhere, and I could set up in there,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.480]   and I could work.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.720]   And by the way, that was actually a really great solution.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.880]   I'll get to it at the end of the show.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.840]   I'll give you some recommendations as to how you can actually do this and make it work.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.880]   And I think that that is a really, really high-quality, good solution.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.680]   But the expenses start to get annoying.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.000]   You also spend, because of moving around a lot, you wind up spending a lot of money on
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.060]   servants and services.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:36.980]   So when you're traveling, you don't have access to a good kitchen or kitchen equipment, so
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.860]   you eat out a lot.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.620]   Or if you move frequently, you just change your house and you move frequently, you wind
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   up having, "Oh, my stuff's in boxes," and so you wind up eating out a lot.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.360]   You wind up using other people to launder your clothes.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.920]   You wind up using other, you just constantly are paying other people to do stuff.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.680]   And then you have the cost of the time.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.720]   Whenever you move, you have to figure out, "How am I going to do this?"
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.840]   And so you say, "Oh, I'm in a new place.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   I need to get a new local SIM card."
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.040]   Well, can I do it easily?
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.640]   Do I speak the language?
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.060]   Who has the best plan?
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.060]   Is it going to work?
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.880]   Is it going to set up and work?
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.520]   In Europe, I needed data, and so I went and I grabbed a local SIM card, and I thought
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.480]   it was going to be great, except that then the SIM had a lock code on it.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.280]   And so every single time, I had to put in the lock code, and just, again, little frustrations.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.720]   Doesn't sound like a lot, but it keeps you from being as productive as you would like
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.120]   to be.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:36.740]   And so there's a constant stream of expenses that are associated with travel.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.880]   Same thing that happens, there's a constant stream of expenses that are associated with
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.320]   moving frequently.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.540]   There's the cost of moving.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.520]   There's the cost of setting up utilities.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.840]   There's the cost of decorating a new house, cost of swapping out furniture, getting rid
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   of stuff, buying new stuff.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.520]   "Oh, I thought I didn't need that.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.920]   I can get rid of it."
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.560]   It's just, there's a constant stream of costs.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:04.720]   So what I have learned is moving frequently is not conducive to generating as much income
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.640]   as otherwise.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.420]   Moving a lot is not ideal.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:16.020]   It can be done, and there can be great adventures that are a result of it.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.080]   If I were going back three years, I would make exactly the same decisions that I've
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.160]   made, and I would deal with all the hardship, partly because it's been fun.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.720]   I've enjoyed the adventure, partly because it allows me to share with you some of the
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.740]   things that I have learned, et cetera.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.920]   But it's been fun, and what has happened is it's created a greater appreciation of the
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   value of stability.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:41.680]   But what I want to tell you is, if you think that you're going to be as productive while
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.600]   you're on the road, just because you can pop open your laptop and code, or just because
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.840]   you can pop open your laptop and write, you are deluding yourself, as I myself have done.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.040]   As I myself have deluded myself significantly on this topic, you are deluding yourself.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.520]   It's not possible.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:05.880]   It's not possible to be as productive on the road, moving around, as it is for you to simply
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.680]   be stationary.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.320]   So what are some solutions?
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.400]   What are some things that I think will work really well?
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.400]   I think that remote working has its place, and can be a really great lifestyle for many
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.400]   people.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:28.320]   I think the first thing to look at is to say, "Can the remote working open up something
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:36.600]   to me that is not otherwise available, such that I'm willing to deal with the hassles?"
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.560]   I love kind of the RV lifestyle, RV living, RV travel.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.880]   And I know of a lot of families who live in an RV, and dad has a traditional job, and
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.440]   he's sitting at his desk from 9 to 5, he's got to be there.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.360]   And he's got some dinky little makeshift solution working, and everyone's trying to be quiet
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.720]   so he can do it.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.480]   And he's dealing with the hassle and the frustration because of what it opens up to him.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.200]   It opens up the chance to take his family on an adventure.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   And they're loving it.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.140]   And I think that if you look at it and you say, "Would I rather deal with some of these
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:23.580]   frustrations and annoyances, and also be able to see the world, travel to 12 countries this
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:29.340]   year, or RV to 20 states, and I'll just deal with the frustrations and be able to do it?"
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.420]   You can do it.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.540]   And as I've said, it can be worth it.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:38.180]   It really can be worth it because by eliminating perhaps your home expenses, you open up a
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.180]   chance to do something totally different, and that can be transformative for your family.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.660]   That can be wonderful, a wonderful solution.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:52.660]   It can be well worth it.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.140]   It's worth putting up with those hassles if you wouldn't otherwise have a chance to do
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.980]   something.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.860]   And you just accept as kind of cost of doing business the fact that I'm going to have diminished
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.580]   productivity here.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:14.360]   And I'm choosing to accept the diminished productivity because I have something else
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.020]   that is going to be a much better solution for me, something else that I'm going to be
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.580]   able to do.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:28.780]   Another thing that you can do is you can invest into – before I do that – people who I
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:39.580]   think are actually very well suited for the traveling lifestyle is going to be individuals
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.220]   without children.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:49.620]   If I were single, I would live in an RV full-time, and I would work in the RV, and I would love
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.620]   it.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.620]   I would move around.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.620]   I would love it.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.140]   Whether I did it all year or whether I just did it for three or four months of the year
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.180]   would be no problem.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.180]   And in today's world, you can solve the Internet issues pretty well.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.740]   If you're in your own RV, you can solve your noise problems, you can solve the environment
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.020]   problems, and you can be extremely productive.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.120]   I would love that.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.180]   Many of my challenges simply come from children, and those are challenges that I embrace eagerly.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.860]   But I do think that it works well to be productive as an individual as long as you don't have
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.880]   the difficulties of dealing with children.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.340]   Similar things to things like hotel rooms.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.580]   I don't believe you're going to build an eight-figure business bouncing around a different
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.580]   hotel room every week.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.820]   That's just too draining.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.220]   It's not there that you can't do the work.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.980]   You can set up in a hotel room, and you can have a computer, and you can have your phone,
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   and you have a computer.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.500]   You can have a good work scenario when you're by yourself.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.900]   I find when I travel and I'm by myself in hotel rooms, it's wonderful.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.340]   It's very productive.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.660]   It's not the same problems.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.920]   The problem with that kind of bouncing around is, well, can I actually maintain my own personal
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.700]   energy well enough to do it?
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:04.980]   Or can I actually deal with the hassles of travels?
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.080]   When the flights are delayed and things are canceled and everything becomes more difficult,
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.540]   can I do it then?
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.400]   Or it's a matter of, do I actually need to manage my staff?
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.620]   You're not going to get there alone, so you need to manage people.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:26.120]   You don't want to be reliant on a tenuous 3G connection in a foreign country when there
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.960]   is a real great market opportunity on the horizon.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:36.180]   I think single people can do the digital nomad thing much more effectively than parents can
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   do it.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.800]   It may be something that you just decide, this is great for a certain time of our life.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.020]   There are lots of people, empty nesters for example, who have raised their children, and
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.480]   they've said, "You know what?
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.480]   We don't have enough money to retire.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.040]   Nor do we necessarily want to retire.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.160]   We're going to work, but what we'll just do is let's take our work on the road.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:00.880]   Let's get a nice RV or let's go and do multi-month rentals at nice places."
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.440]   By the way, Airbnb has a new thing now where you can test your internet speed, which is
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.800]   a useful feature to know, am I going to have pretty decent internet at this house?
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:18.020]   So the travel can be a great way to keep an income coming in while also continuing on
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.440]   and enjoying the adventures that are different than what you've previously done.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.720]   The next thing is investing in the right equipment.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   Every time I have invested in the right equipment, it has paid off.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.240]   I've never wasted money by buying the right equipment.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.320]   Every time I bought something that was just good enough, I've regretted it.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:44.160]   And so if we expand that, I think one of the challenges, many of the challenges that I
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:50.480]   have faced have often been simply due to being too cheap and not investing properly in the
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.480]   right tools.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.920]   And when I have purchased the right tools, it's made all the difference in the world.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:04.680]   Example, when I actually bought that second camper on our RV trip, everything changed.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.360]   It was not still perfect.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:14.120]   It was challenging still, but I made a lot of money from the back of that camper.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.480]   It was hard sometimes to find the right location.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.240]   I'd be sitting in some coffee shop somewhere recording a class or something that I was
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:26.080]   doing, but I made a lot of money because I had better equipment.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.360]   And so investing into the proper infrastructure and doing it as a cost of doing business is
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   I think important.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.120]   I'm going to have a standalone trailer.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.680]   I'm going to have a standalone office.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.940]   It's going to be set up properly.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.800]   It's going to have the very best cell phone repeaters.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.960]   It's going to have the very best MIMO system, the very best mesh network that works with
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.080]   my whole system.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.640]   That's the way to do it.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.520]   And investing into the right infrastructure of your life can pay dividends as long as
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:01.440]   you're in some place where there is an opportunity for you to make more money.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.360]   It really is worth it.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:12.760]   I think the ultimate lifestyle, the best lifestyle, if you have kind of the bug to move around
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:19.120]   a lot, the best lifestyle is to simply not try to do it on the cheap, but to say, "I'm
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.000]   going to go ahead and I'm going to set things up properly."
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.360]   If you want to have multiple homes, I think that's ideal, but multiple homes with proper
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.640]   offices, right?
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.320]   You want to have a multiple, your house with your office where everything is set up, where
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.480]   you can go in and you know everything is going to work, and you can sit down and be productive.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:41.000]   That might mean I have one primary house and then I have a house that I go to every year
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.240]   for the summer, or I have a second home, or I have three of the houses across the world.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.680]   But just going ahead and planning ahead and saying, "Here's what's necessary for me to
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   be productive.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:58.320]   What's necessary is that I have a good internet signal, that I have a quiet environment, that
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.480]   I have enough space to set up a video camera," or whatever your personal needs are, and then
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.800]   committing it to it.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.120]   Not everybody creates media.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.480]   Not everybody needs a video camera.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.000]   Not everybody needs as much space even as I need.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.120]   I have gotten lots of great work done by just simply taking a large closet and putting in
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   a table.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.720]   Again, I share some of the tips that I've learned.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.200]   One of the first things that I do is if I'm in a new location, I'm going to be there a
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.920]   month, I find that I don't like leaving the house to go to work if I can avoid it.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.240]   So I usually grab a master bedroom closet, a walk-in closet.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.760]   I'll pop into Costco or Walmart, grab a folding table, a folding chair, buy them, set them
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.920]   up, just leave them in the house when I go.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.960]   It makes all the difference in the world to have a good place where everything can stay
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.240]   set up and I can get my work done.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.840]   So the best lifestyle is going to be just simply buckling down and recognizing it's
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   not optional for me to have this.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.920]   It's not just in the same way that it's not optional for a contractor to have the necessary
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.420]   tools to do his work.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.960]   It's not optional for me to have the tools that are necessary to do my work.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:06.200]   One of those tools that I need is a computer, a quiet space, a good internet connection,
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:11.840]   a microphone, a video camera, whatever your personal needs are.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.360]   Make sure that you have those.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   Then you also can adjust your travel to that.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.920]   So for example, there are many great YouTube video makers who their life looks glamorous
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.040]   but it's actually not quite the way it looks.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.400]   They will have two or three days of adventure, they'll film it and then they sit still
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.800]   for three or four days to edit videos, handle the business, etc., do their calls.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.120]   I think that's where it's also valuable to look at and say back to the complications
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   of children, right?
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.960]   Because we homeschool then it's kind of you're always on in that context.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.940]   Yes, we don't do formal academics every day.
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.040]   We do lots of world schooling, etc.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:55.880]   But there's something about saying, "Hey, there are work days and there are rest days."
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.200]   When you're homeschooling though, every day is a work day because you're always in charge
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   of supervision.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.960]   You don't send the children away to school, thus you don't have the breaks to be able
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.560]   to work on your own things for sure during those times because someone else is doing
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.700]   childcare.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:15.440]   And so those demands are high and thus it leads to more complications.
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.920]   I do think that there's a place for traveling around as kind of a part-time thing.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.440]   I don't anticipate – I'm always careful with these statements.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.440]   I think I've got it cautious enough.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.680]   I don't anticipate ever again becoming a full-time digital nomad the way that we did
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.280]   for the six months of last year.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.280]   I enjoyed it.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   I loved it.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.880]   I felt totally free and I loved it.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.960]   But I don't anticipate doing it again because it was too disruptive.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.920]   The costs of kind of reintegrating and the costs of doing it all again and the cost of
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.880]   the time and everything like that is too disruptive.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.480]   I think I will always keep at least a primary house even if it's empty.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.480]   I don't care about the money.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:07.080]   I'll always keep a primary house because it smooths everything out at least for the
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.000]   foreseeable future while we have children.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.600]   I won't do the digital nomad full-time thing again.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:19.360]   What I will do and what I think is great is enjoy the fact that we can do more mobile
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.800]   work and let it add a little bit of spice to life.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:29.440]   And so it's actually fun to go for a week or two weeks or a month and do a working holiday
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   on the road.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.600]   It's a really neat lifestyle to say, "You know what?
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.080]   Let's go spend a month in London and I'm going to work every morning from 8 a.m. to
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.600]   noon and I'll rent a second hotel room to work in.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.840]   But then in the afternoon we'll do cultural stuff."
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.920]   That's really fun or even on a smaller basis.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.320]   One of the things that I talked about how I love having the pickup truck camper.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.960]   I've actually over the years when I've had trouble focusing in my primary office,
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:01.480]   I've found that going somewhere else with a specific focus has been great.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.880]   And so there was one time a few years ago, actually the income course.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.200]   I created the entire income course sitting in a local park and I carried a table with
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.720]   me and every day I would go and I didn't have internet signal.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.360]   And all I did was work on it and record.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.800]   And so using an external place was very good for my personal productivity.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.520]   Now go set up my table in the park, set up my gear.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:34.640]   At that time I didn't even have it as compact as I have it now and get the work done.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   And you can solve with a simple inverter.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.760]   You can grab all the power you need from your car.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.520]   For most of us there's no problem there.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520]   Or grab an extra battery.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.480]   I would carry an extra deep cycle battery with me and it worked great.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.960]   Another solution that I think is great for creative folks, just people who want to have
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.120]   a change is grab yourself a little cargo trailer.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.020]   Something like a 10-foot cargo trailer that you can pull behind your vehicle.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:04.680]   Put in the cargo trailer a desk and a chair and then put in a nice recliner.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.600]   Just grab a nice lazy boy type recliner and put that in there.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.700]   Or maybe a futon sofa.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.720]   And then have that be your mobile office.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.000]   You can take it to a beautiful place, take it to a beautiful park, open the door, look
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.400]   at the mountains, take it to a beautiful river.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.120]   Find some place that's different and you can pop your laptop on the desk.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.960]   You can get just as much writing done or just as much planning and goal setting and things
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   done.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.840]   That's what I've done most of the time.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.880]   And yet having that chance to be productive out of the office is really refreshing.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.280]   And you're covered in the – you've got protection from the sun, protection from the
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.640]   wind, protection from noise even.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.720]   And yet you can see something different outside of your door.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.040]   And so it's not that traveling around is always a bad thing.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.000]   It's just that you need to be aware of what your particular situation is and then learn
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.720]   from other people.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:02.040]   In summary, for me, I don't think that I'll do the full-time digital nomad thing again.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.620]   There may be times, right?
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:07.040]   Maybe when the children get older we'll do the RV thing again.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.760]   We might do a sailing thing at some point.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.880]   We might just travel.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.360]   But right now my plan is to stick to my three months on, one month off.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.320]   Three months on, one month off.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.240]   Three months of intense work in a standard traditional setup and then one month off to
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.600]   travel, to do whatever we want, to have a wacky schedule.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.800]   Three months on, one month off is my plan.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.480]   And then we'll see how it goes.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.040]   As always, I'll keep you in the loop.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.200]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.920]   Hope these ideas and my experiences are helpful to you.
