[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   We think that self-assembly,
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.760]   this modular reconfigurable algorithm
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.520]   for constructing space structures in orbit
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.760]   is gonna give us this promise of space architecture
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.320]   that's actually worth living in.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   - You do believe we might one day
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.920]   become intergalactic civilization?
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.060]   - I have a hope, yeah.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.240]   - The following is a conversation with Ariel Egbla,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.120]   She's especially interested in autonomously
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.700]   self-assembling space architectures,
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.880]   basically giant space structures
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.720]   that can sustain human life
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.440]   and that assemble themselves out in space
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   and then orbit Earth, Moon, Mars, and other planets.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.280]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.240]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480]   in the description.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.400]   And now, dear friends, here's Ariel Egbla.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560]   When did you first fall in love with space exploration
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.280]   and space in general?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.140]   - My parents are both ex-Air Force.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.880]   So my dad's an A-10 fighter pilot
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.680]   and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.040]   but it was early enough
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.420]   that women were not allowed in combat at that time.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.400]   And so I grew up with these two pilots
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.680]   and although they themselves did not become astronauts,
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.000]   there's a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300]   becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.800]   What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.720]   to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging?
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.940]   And to couple with that,
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.100]   my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.780]   And so I, as a kid, read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.300]   all these different classics of science fiction
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.540]   that he had introduced me to.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.920]   And that just started a love affair with space exploration
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.680]   and really thinking about civilization scale
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.760]   space exploration.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   - So did they themselves dream about going to the stars
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.020]   as opposed to flying here in the Earth's atmosphere,
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.020]   just looking up?
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.100]   - Yeah, my dad always said he was absolutely convinced
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.300]   'cause he was a child of the Apollo years
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.620]   that he would get to go in his lifetime.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.940]   Really thought it was gonna happen.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.780]   And so it was a challenge and sad for many people
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260]   when to their view on the outside,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.980]   space exploration slowed down for a period of time.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.740]   In reality, we were just catching up.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.160]   I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.280]   more than the rest of society was ready for.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.640]   And now we're coming back to this moment
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   for space exploration where we actually have an economy
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800]   and we have the other accoutrement that society needs
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.000]   to be able to make space exploration more real.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360]   And my dad's thrilled because finally,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.000]   not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.940]   but as he's an older man,
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.520]   he now can see still within his lifetime,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.560]   people really getting a chance
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.240]   or maybe even go to Mars.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.160]   - So settlement, civilizations and other planets,
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.640]   that's the cool thing to dream about in the future.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   - It certainly is.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.640]   - What was the favorite sci-fi authors when you're growing up?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.600]   - Pablo Isaac Asimov Foundation Trilogy.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.280]   This is an amazing story of Harry Seldon,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.240]   this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920]   well, according to the story,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.480]   different ends of the universe
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.880]   and has this interesting focus on society.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.240]   So it's not just space exploration
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.960]   which is a lot of what I work on day to day at MIT,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.000]   but how do you structure a society
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.580]   across those vast expanses of distance and time?
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.680]   And so I'd say absolutely a favorite.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.080]   Now though, my favorite is Neil Stevenson and "Seveneves."
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.640]   It's a book that inspired my own PhD research
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.120]   and some ongoing work that we're doing with NASA now
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.680]   for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.720]   - We were saying offline about Neil Stevenson
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.600]   'cause I just recently had a conversation with him.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.680]   And I said that not until I was doing the research for him
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   that I realized he also had a role to play in "Blue Origin."
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.800]   So it's like sci-fi actually having a role to play
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.120]   in the design, engineering,
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.680]   just the implementation of ideas
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.880]   that kind of percolate out from the sci-fi world
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.000]   and actually become reality.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.560]   It's kind of a fascinating figure in that way.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.720]   Do you also think about him beyond just his work
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.200]   in science fiction, but his role in coming up
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   with wild, crazy ideas that actually become reality?
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.880]   - Yes, I think it's a great example of this cycle
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.960]   between authors and scientists and engineers
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.100]   that we can be inspired in one generation
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.880]   by what authors dream up.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.720]   We build it, we make it a reality,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.400]   and then that inspires another generation
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.520]   of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.240]   I think Neil Stevenson does a beautiful job
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.720]   of being what we'd call a hard science fiction author.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   So it's really grounded in a lot of science,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.920]   which makes it very compelling for me
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.120]   as a scientist and engineer to read
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.240]   and then be challenged to make that vision of reality.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.080]   The other community that Neil's involved with
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   and some of my other mentors are involved with
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.920]   that we are thinking about more and more
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.960]   in the work that we do at MIT is the Long Now Foundation.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.840]   And this focus on what does society need to take
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.440]   in terms of steps at this juncture,
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.480]   this particular inflection point in human history
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.160]   to make sure that we're setting ourselves up
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.440]   for a long and prosperous horizon for humanity's horizons.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.360]   There's a lot of examples
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   of what the Long Now Foundation does and thinks about.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.500]   But when I think about this in my own work,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.840]   it's what does it take to scale
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.720]   humanity's presence in orbit?
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.200]   We are seeing some additional investment
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   in commercial space habitats.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.640]   So it'll no longer be just NASA
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.400]   running the International Space Station,
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.080]   but to really democratize access to space,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.520]   to have, like Bezos wants to have millions of people
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.000]   living and working in space,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.440]   you need architecture that's bigger and grander
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.920]   and can actually scale.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.080]   That means you need to be thinking about
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   how can you construct things for long-time horizons
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.720]   that are really sustainable in orbit
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.440]   or on a surface of a celestial body
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.160]   that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.440]   that we currently have available.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.400]   And that's what led me to self-assembly
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.280]   and other models of in-space construction.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.560]   - Okay, every time you speak,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.320]   I get like a million tangent ideas.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.440]   - You can cut me off, keep going.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.200]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please keep talking.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.120]   This is amazing.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.080]   I just, there's like a million ideas.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.800]   So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.040]   Do you think about the threats to human civilization
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.920]   that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.720]   of humans in space and on other planets?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.880]   What are you worried about?
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.640]   Nuclear war, pandemics,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.720]   super intelligent artificial intelligence systems,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.160]   more not existential crises,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.280]   but ones that have potentially significant
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   detrimental effects on society like climate change,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.120]   those kinds of things.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.840]   And then there's of course the fun ass story
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.480]   coming out from the darkness and hitting all Earth.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.120]   There's been a few movies on that.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   Anyway, is there something that you think about
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.320]   that threatens us in this century?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.600]   - I mean, as an ex-military family,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   we used to talk about all of this.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.040]   We would say that luck favors the prepared.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.240]   And so growing up, we had a plan,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.560]   actually a family plan for what we would do in a pandemic.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   Didn't think we were gonna have to put that
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.600]   in a plan into place and here we are.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   We do, certainly among my own family and my friends
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   and then our work at MIT,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.960]   we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.360]   and what role does space exploration
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.280]   and getting humans off world have to play
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.160]   in a resilient future for humanity.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.480]   But what I actually find more compelling recently
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon Earth
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.040]   through a path of space exploration or space voyaging,
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.920]   is to see how we can use space technology
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.320]   to keep Earth livable.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.480]   The obvious direct ways of doing this
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.360]   would be satellite technology that's helping us learn more
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.320]   about climate change or emitters or CO2.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.200]   But there's also a future for geoengineering
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   that might be space-based.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.920]   A lot of questions that would have to be answered around that
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.320]   but these are examples of pivoting our focus away
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   from maybe the Hollywood vision of,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.240]   oh, an asteroid's gonna come,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.400]   we're all gonna have to escape Earth
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   to let's use our considerable technology prowess
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.440]   and use space technology to save Earth
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.240]   and be very much focused on how we can have
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.840]   a worthwhile life for Earth's citizens.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.080]   Even as some of us wanna go out and further venturing.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.120]   - Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.600]   But also it does seem that by placing us in harsh conditions,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.880]   the harsh conditions of space,
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.680]   the harsh conditions of planets,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.000]   and the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.520]   the robotics, the materials, all of that,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.920]   that's just a nice way to come up with cool new things.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.120]   - Great forcing function, yeah.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.200]   - Yeah, it's a forcing, exactly.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.880]   It's a forcing function like survival.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.960]   Don't get this right, you die.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.400]   So, and that you can bring back to Earth
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.920]   and it will improve, like figuring out food in space
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.840]   will make you figure out how to eat,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.120]   live healthier lives here on Earth.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.880]   - So true, I mean, some of the technologies
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.680]   that we're directly looking at right now
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.040]   for space habitats, it's hard to keep humans alive
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.600]   in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.040]   and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.880]   Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.620]   is energy efficient, cooling and air conditioning,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.880]   air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.880]   being able to have habitats that are themselves resilient
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.320]   to extremes of space weather and radiation.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.360]   And some of these are direct translational opportunities
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.720]   for areas turned by natural disasters.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.160]   People in California a decade ago
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.840]   would never have had to think about having an airtight house
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.800]   but now with wildfires, maybe you do want something close
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   to an airtight house, how do you manage that?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.760]   There's a lot of technologies
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.080]   from the space habitation world
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.040]   that we are hoping we can actually bring back down
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.680]   to benefit life on Earth as well
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.240]   in these extreme environment contexts.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.880]   - Okay, so you mentioned to go back to swarm.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.720]   - Yeah.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.120]   - So that was interesting to you,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.380]   first of all, in your own work,
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.640]   but also I believe you said something
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.920]   that was inspiring from Neil Stephenson as well.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   So when you say swarm, are you thinking about architectures
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.360]   or are you thinking about artificial intelligence
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   like robotics or are those kind of intermixed?
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.200]   - I think the future that we're seeing
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   is that they're going to be intermixed,
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.160]   which is really exciting.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.240]   So the future of space habitats
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.560]   are one of intelligent structures,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.960]   maybe not all the way to how
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.480]   and the 2001 "Space Odyssey" reference
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.520]   that scares people about the habitat
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.820]   having a mind of its own.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   But certainly we're building systems now
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.800]   where the habitat has sensing technology
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.360]   that allows it to communicate its basic functions,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   maintaining life support for the astronauts,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   but could also communicate in symbiosis
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.240]   with these swarm robots
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.720]   that would be on the outside of the spacecraft,
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.180]   whether it's in a microgravity orbiting environment
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.240]   or on the surface.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.200]   And these little robots, they crawl,
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.360]   just a la Neil Stephenson and "Seveneves,"
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.500]   they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.200]   looking for micrometeorite punctures
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.560]   or gas leaks or other faults and defects.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.040]   And right now we're just working on the diagnosis.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.240]   So can the swarm with its collective intelligence
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.200]   act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.280]   But in the future, we'd also love
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.080]   for these little micro robots to repair in situ
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.600]   and really be like ants living in a tree
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.480]   all together connected to the spacecraft.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.240]   - Do you envision the system to be fully distributed
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.800]   and just like an ant colony
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.640]   if one of them is damaged or whatever,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.520]   loses control and all those kinds of things
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.880]   that that doesn't affect the performance
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.320]   of the complete system
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.960]   or doesn't need to be centralized?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.160]   This is more like almost a technical question.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.040]   Do you think we could-- - Good architecture question.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.880]   - Right, from the ground up,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.800]   it's so scary to go fully distributed.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.160]   - Yes. (laughing)
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.680]   - But it's also exceptionally powerful, right?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.840]   A robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   Where do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.440]   starting from scratch,
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.600]   do you think we should be doing
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.180]   architecture-wise distributed systems?
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.280]   - For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.360]   and safety profile that's really critical.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.160]   So whether it's small swarm robots
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.320]   where it doesn't matter if you lose a few of them,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.880]   to habitats that instead of having
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.840]   a central monolithic habitat,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.800]   you might actually be able to have
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.080]   a decentralized node of a space station
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.960]   so that you can kind of right out of "Star Wars,"
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.320]   you can shut a blast door if there's a fire
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.080]   or if there's a conflict in a certain area
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.160]   and you can move the humans and the crew
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.840]   into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.960]   There's another idea out of Neil Stephenson's "Seveneves"
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.840]   actually where these arclets,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.200]   which were decentralized spacecraft that could form
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.960]   and dock little temporary space stations with each other
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.120]   and then separate and go off on their way
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.880]   and have a decentralized approach to living in space.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.080]   - So the self-assembly component of that too,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.760]   so this is your PhD work and beyond.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.400]   You explored autonomously self-assembling
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.200]   space architecture for future space tourists' habitats
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.400]   and space stations in orbit around Earth, Moon, and Mars.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.640]   There's few things I personally find sexier
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.560]   than self-assembling space,
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.960]   autonomously self-assembling space architecture.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.720]   In general, it doesn't even need to be space.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.080]   The idea of self-assembling architectures
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.400]   is really interesting, like building a bridge
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.560]   or something like that through self-assembling materials.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.560]   It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.880]   because optimization is built in.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.400]   So you can build the most optimal structures
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.200]   given dynamic, uncertain changing conditions.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.360]   So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.240]   about this work, about Tesserae?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.960]   What is it in general?
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.400]   Any cool stuff 'cause this is super cool.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.120]   - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.680]   So Tesserae is my PhD research.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.840]   It's this idea that we could take tiles
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.000]   that construct a large structure like a buckyball.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.840]   Yeah, this is exactly what we're looking at here,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.680]   which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.360]   They're released to float in microgravity.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.200]   Magnets, pretty powerful electropermanent magnets
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.480]   on their edges draw them together for autonomous docking.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.080]   So there's no human in the loop here
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.160]   and there's no central agent coordinating,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.720]   saying tile one, go to tile two.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.480]   It's completely decentralized system.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.840]   They find each other on their own.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.040]   What we don't show in this video
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.200]   is what happens if there's an error, right?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.160]   So what happens if they bond incorrectly?
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.640]   The tiles have sensing, so proximity sensing,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.760]   magnetometer, other sensors that allow them
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.920]   to detect a good bond versus a bad bond
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.040]   and pulse off and self-correct,
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.680]   which anybody who works in the field of self-assembly
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.760]   will tell you that error detection and correction,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.040]   just like error detection in a DNA sequence
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.900]   or protein folding is really important part of the system
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.160]   for that robustness.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.360]   And so we've done a lot of work to engineer
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.320]   that ability for the tiles to be self-determining.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.880]   They know whether they're forming the structure
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.240]   that they're supposed to form or not.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.400]   - They know if they're in a toxic relationship
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.800]   and they need to get out.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.720]   - Right, right, if they need to separate, exactly, yeah.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.520]   - All right, this is like so amazing.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.000]   And for people who are just listening to this,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.200]   yeah, there's a lot, I mean, how large are these tiles?
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.800]   - So the size that we use in the lab,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.160]   they can really be any size
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   'cause we can scale them down to do testing in microgravity.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.040]   So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.120]   to the International Space Station a couple of years ago
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   to test the code, test the state machine,
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.280]   test the algorithm of self-assembly.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   But now we're actually building
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.680]   our first ever human scale tiles.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.040]   They're me human size, so a little smaller
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.720]   than maybe your average human,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.040]   but they're 2.5 feet on edge length.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.720]   The larger scale that we would love to build in the future
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   would actually be tiles that are big enough
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.920]   to form a buckyball, big open spherical volume,
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.620]   spherical approximation volume,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.200]   that'd be about 10 meters in diameter, so 30 feet,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.360]   which is much bigger and grander in terms of open space
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   than any current module on the ISS.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.160]   And one of the goals of this project was to say,
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.800]   what's the purpose of next generation space architecture?
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.640]   Should it be something that really inspires
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.800]   and delights people when you float into that space?
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.720]   Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.760]   when you walk into a really stunning piece
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.080]   of architecture on Earth?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.280]   And so we think that self-assembly,
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   this modular reconfigurable algorithm
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.060]   for constructing space structures in orbit
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.280]   is gonna give us this promise of space architecture
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.440]   that's actually worth living in.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.320]   - Living in, oh, I thought you also meant
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.320]   from like outside artistic perspective,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.640]   when you see the whole thing, it's just--
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.480]   - With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.440]   You know, when you like go like into Vegas,
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.040]   whenever you go into a city and it like over the hill
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.720]   appears in front of you, and I mean,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.360]   there's something majestic about seeing like,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.280]   wow, humans created that.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.800]   It gives you like hope about like,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   if these a bunch of ants were able to figure out
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.440]   how to build skyscrapers that light up.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   And in general, the design of these tiles
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.440]   and the way you envision it are pretty scalable.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   - Yes, and they're inspired by exactly
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.560]   what you mentioned a moment ago,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.000]   which is we have these patterns of self-assembly on earth.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.040]   And there's a lot of fantastic MIT research
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.520]   that we're building this concept on.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.400]   So like Daniela Rus at CSAIL and Pebbles
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   taking the power of magnets to create units
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.200]   that are themselves interchangeable,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.640]   this notion of programmable matter.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.600]   And so we're interested in going really big with it
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.360]   to build big scale space structures with programmable tiles.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.600]   But there's also a really fascinating, you know,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.960]   end of that on the other side of the spectrum,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.400]   which is how small can you go with matter
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.800]   that's programmable and stacks and builds itself
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.920]   and creates a bridge or something in the future.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.560]   - What do you envision the thing would look like?
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.320]   Like when you imagine a thing far into the future
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.720]   where there's, so we're not even thinking about like,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   small space, let's not call them small,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.800]   but are currently sized space stations,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.000]   but like something gigantic.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.280]   What do you envision?
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.640]   Is this something with symmetry
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.880]   or is this something we can't even come up with yet?
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.880]   Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.680]   - I've got three candidates that I would love to build.
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.640]   If we're talking about monumental space architecture,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.680]   one is what does a space cathedral look like?
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.840]   It can be a secular cathedral,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.400]   doesn't necessarily have to be about religion,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.920]   but that notion of long sight lines,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.240]   inspiring, stunning architecture when you go in.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.080]   And you can imagine floating,
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.560]   instead of being on the ground and only looking up,
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.720]   in space, you could be in a central node
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.760]   and each direction you look at,
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.080]   all the cardinal directions are spires going off
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.440]   in a really large and long way.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.200]   So that's concept number one.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.000]   Number two would be something more organic
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.800]   that's not just geometric.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.440]   So here, one of the ideas that we're working on at MIT
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.600]   in my lab is to say, could you,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.280]   instead of the tesserae model, right?
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.920]   Which is self-assembling a shell,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.000]   could you define a module that's a node,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.960]   a small node that someone can live in
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.640]   and you self-assemble a lot of those together,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.600]   they're called a plesiohedrons, like space filling solids,
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.560]   and you dock a bunch of them together
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   and you can create a really organic structure out of that.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.440]   So the same way that muscles accrete to appear,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.560]   you can have these nodes that dock together
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.640]   and one shape that I would love to form out of this
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.440]   is something like a nautilus, a seashell,
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.480]   that beautiful Fibonacci spiral sequence
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.920]   that you get in that shape,
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.280]   which I think would be a stunning and fabulous
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.320]   aggregated space station.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.200]   - You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.040]   - Yeah, plesiohedron.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.240]   - So that's a space filling--
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.040]   - Solid, the simplest thing to think of is like a cube.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.000]   - Oh, cubes. - A cube, right?
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.640]   So you can stack cubes together
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.400]   and if you had an infinite number of cubes,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.160]   you'd fill all that space,
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.920]   there's no gaps in between the cubes,
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.400]   they stack and fill space.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.720]   Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.480]   and that's actually one of the candidate structures
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.680]   that we think would be great for space stations.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.080]   - What's the truncated part?
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.880]   - Ah, so you cut off,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.560]   an octahedron actually has little pointy areas,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.320]   you truncate certain sections of it
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.040]   and you get surfaces that are on the structure
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.840]   that are cubes and I think hexagons,
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.600]   I have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.240]   But overall, a truncated octahedron can be bonded
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.040]   to other truncated octahedrons and just like a cube,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.880]   it fills all the gaps as you build it out.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.760]   So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.200]   they come together at an airlock,
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.280]   which is what we space people call doors in space
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.240]   and you dock them on all sides
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.120]   and you've basically created this decentralized network
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.000]   of space nodes that make a big space station
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.680]   and once you have enough of them
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.480]   and you're growing with enough big units,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.040]   you can do it in any macro shape you want,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.360]   that's where the Nautilus comes in,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.920]   this could be designed an organically inspired shape
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.760]   for a space station.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.840]   - Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.720]   we space people.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.200]   I know you meant people that are doing research
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.840]   on space exploration, space technology,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.920]   but it also made me think of a future,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.600]   there's earth people and there's those space people.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.400]   - I'd love to unite those two.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.160]   - Yeah, no, no, for sure, for sure.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.760]   But like, it's like New Yorkers
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.680]   and like Texans or something like that.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.520]   Yeah, of course, you live for a time in New York
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.160]   and then you go up to Boston
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.120]   but for a time you're the space people.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.160]   I know those space people, they're kind of wild up there.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.520]   - Let's see how that dynamic evolves.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.680]   - Yeah, exactly, there's that culture, culture forms
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.040]   and I would love to see what kind of culture,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.160]   once you have sort of more and more civilians,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.560]   I mean, there's a human,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.480]   I mean, I love psychology and sociology
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.600]   and I'll maybe ask you about that too,
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.640]   which is like the dynamic between humans.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.720]   You have to kind of start considering that
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   and you start spending more and more time up in space
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.800]   and start sending civilians,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.160]   start sending bigger and bigger groups of people.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.960]   And then of course, the beautiful and the ugly emerges
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.920]   from the human nature that we haven't been able to escape
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.240]   up to this point.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.120]   But when you say the plesiohedrons, these kinds of shapes,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.560]   are they multifunctional?
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.760]   Like is the idea you'd be able to,
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:02.280]   humans can occupy them safely in some of them
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.880]   and some others have some other purposes?
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.320]   - Exactly, one could be sleeping quarters,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.440]   one could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.800]   one could be a storage depot,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.480]   essentially all of the different rooms or functions
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.920]   that you might need in a space station
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.960]   could be subdivided into these nodes
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.280]   and then stacked together.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.520]   And one of the promises of both Tesserae,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.960]   my original PhD research, which is these shells,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.560]   and then this follow-on node concept
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.160]   is that right now we build space stations
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.840]   and once they're built, they're done.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.320]   You can't really change them profoundly,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.000]   but the benefit of a modular self-assembling system
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   is you can disassemble it,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.840]   you can completely reconfigure it.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.280]   So if your mission changes
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.360]   or the number of people in space that you wanna host,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.800]   if you have a space conference happening
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   like South by Southwest.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.120]   - I was thinking space party,
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.600]   but space conference is good too.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.520]   (Tesserae laughs)
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.720]   - Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.800]   what were window tiles yesterday, cupola tiles,
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.560]   and make them into a birthing port
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.640]   so that you can welcome five new spaceships
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.360]   to come and join you in space.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.360]   That's what this promise of reconfigurable space architecture
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.160]   might allow us to explore.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.760]   - I've been hanging out with Grimes recently,
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.280]   I just feel like she belongs up in space.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.560]   This is like designed for artists, essentially.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.280]   I imagine, I mean, this is what South by
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.240]   keeps introducing me to,
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.080]   there's like the weird and the beautiful people
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.480]   and like the artists.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.360]   And it feels like there's a lot of opportunities
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.720]   for art and design.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.560]   - 100%.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.920]   - It's like space is a combination of arts,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.120]   design and great engineering.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.840]   It's a safety critical with like the highest of stakes.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.760]   So don't, you can't mess it up.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.680]   And is this, first of all, you're talking about tiling.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.640]   So Neil Stephenson is obsessed about tiling.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.840]   I don't know if it's related to any of this,
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.640]   but he seems to be obsessed with like,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.680]   how do you tile a space?
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.120]   That's like a geometric notion, like the tessellation.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.560]   And it's, I mean, it's a beautiful idea for architecture
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.440]   that you can self-assemble these different shapes
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.520]   and you can have probably some centralized guidance
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.760]   of the kind of thing you want to build.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.080]   But they also kind of figure stuff out themselves
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.560]   in terms of the low level details,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.400]   in terms of the figuring out
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.760]   when everything fits just right.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:23.080]   For the OCD people, like, what's that subreddit?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.680]   Pleasantly, it's like really fun.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.400]   Everything, they have like videos of everything
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.600]   is just pleasant when everything just fits perfectly.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.440]   - Very pleasing.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.560]   All the tolerances come together.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.440]   - So they figure that out on themselves
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.360]   and the local robotics problem.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.040]   But by the way, was Daniela Rose Pebbles,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:38.880]   was the Pebbles Project?
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.560]   - Yeah, the Pebbles Project are little cubes
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.160]   that have EPMs in them, electropermanent magnets,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   and they can self-disassemble.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.400]   So they'll turn off and so you'll have this little structure
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.720]   that all of a sudden can flip the little pebbles over
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.600]   and essentially just disaggregate.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.640]   - They have to make some pleasing sounds.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.480]   - Yes.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.680]   (imitates sound)
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.440]   - And that's gonna, so I'm supposed to talk to Daniela,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.720]   so I'll probably spend an hour just discussing
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.040]   the sounds on the pebbles.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.600]   Okay, what were we talking about?
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.040]   So that's, 'cause you mentioned two, I think.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.120]   - Right, my third one.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.280]   - Yeah, is there a third one?
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.640]   - My third one is a ring world,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.360]   just because every science fiction book ever
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.880]   that's worth anything has a ring world in it.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.720]   And--
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.840]   - Is it a donut?
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.520]   - A donut, yeah, so really big torus
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.480]   that could encircle a planet
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.600]   or encircle another celestial body,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.160]   maybe an asteroid or a small moon.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.120]   And the promise here is just the beauty
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.920]   of being able to have that geometry in orbit
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.360]   and all that surface area for solar panels
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.600]   and docking and essentially just all of what that enables,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.960]   to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.440]   - By the way, for the viewers,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.560]   we're looking at figure 11, what paper is this from?
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.600]   This is a hexagonal tiling of a torus
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.840]   generated in Mathematica, referencing code
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.080]   and approach from two citations.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.240]   So we're looking at a tiled donut, and I'm now hungry.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.920]   So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.720]   - This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.240]   This was an approach to say, great,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.480]   we've come up with this tessellation approach
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.840]   for a buckyball.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.120]   And we picked the buckyball
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.320]   because it is the most efficient surface area
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.940]   to volume shape and what's expensive in space,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.360]   the surface area, shipping up all that material.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.780]   So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.820]   But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.040]   we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.420]   and this is one example with hexagons,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.120]   to be able to say, could we take this same tesserae approach
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.200]   of self-assembling tiles and create other geometries?
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.560]   - This is so freaking cool.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.380]   That's awesome.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.440]   So you mentioned microgravity, and I saw,
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.400]   I believe that there's a picture of you
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.240]   floating in microgravity.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.760]   When did you get to experience that?
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.600]   What was that like?
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.920]   - Ah, so I've flown nine times
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.000]   on the affectionately known as the Vomit Comet.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.520]   It's the parabolic flight, and essentially,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.280]   it does what you'd want a plane never to do.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.040]   It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.880]   - Oh, that's a picture of you.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.760]   That's tesserae.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.320]   That's super early in my PhD.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.800]   Some of just the passive tiles,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.280]   before we even put electronics in,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.120]   we were just testing the magnet polarity
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.920]   and the, essentially, is it an energy favorable structure
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.260]   to self-assemble on its own?
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.920]   So we tweaked a lot of things between--
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   - Are we looking at a couple of them?
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.200]   - Yeah, you're looking at a bunch of them there.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.920]   It's almost 32 of them.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   Yeah, they're clumping.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.680]   They're clumping, yeah.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.160]   - Can you comment on what's the difference
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.920]   between microgravity and zero gravity?
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.760]   - Yes, so there is--
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.000]   - Is that an important difference?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.840]   - It's an important difference.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.600]   There is no zero gravity.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.760]   There's no, nothing, there's, in the universe,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.000]   there is no such thing as zero gravity.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.200]   So Newton's law of gravity tells us
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.280]   that there's always gravity attraction
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.320]   between any two objects.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.240]   So zero G is a shorthand that some of us fall into using,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.400]   where it's a little easier to communicate to the public.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   The accurate term is microgravity,
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.040]   where you are essentially floating, you're weightless,
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.240]   but generally in free fall.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.600]   So on the parabolic flights, the Vomit Comet,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   you're in free fall at the end of the parabola.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.400]   And in orbit around the Earth when you're floating,
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.360]   you're also in free fall.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.880]   So that's micro-G. - What was it like?
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.640]   So affectionately called Vomit Comet,
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.760]   I'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.040]   So what's it like?
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.560]   What's your first time,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.920]   so both philosophically, spiritually, and biologically,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.840]   what's it like?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.320]   - It's profound.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.120]   It is unlike anything else you will experience on Earth
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.640]   because it is this true feeling of weightlessness
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.000]   with no drag.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.680]   So the closest experience you could think of
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.000]   would be floating in a pool,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.840]   but you move slowly when you float in a pool
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.520]   and your motion is restricted.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.960]   When you're floating, it's just you and your body flying,
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.160]   like in a dream.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.280]   It takes the littlest amount of energy,
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.440]   like a finger tap against the wall of the plane
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.400]   to shoot all the way across the fuselage.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.480]   - Wow, and you can move at full speed.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.120]   You can move your arms. - Exactly.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.680]   - So your muscles work. - There's no, yeah.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.800]   - There's no resistance. - There's no resistance.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.960]   They actually tell you to make a memory
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.440]   when you're on the plane
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.880]   because it's such a fleeting experience for your body
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.960]   that even a few days later,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.800]   you've already forgotten exactly what it felt like.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.120]   It's so foreign to the human experience.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.520]   - They kind of suggest that you explicitly try
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.360]   to really form this into a memory
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.680]   and then you can do the replay.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   Is that for training? - Cognitively freeze it.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.640]   Yeah. (laughs)
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.200]   - Save.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.960]   When we have Neuralink, we can replay that.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.800]   - There you go.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.000]   - We can replay that memory.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   is it biologically stressful?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.600]   - You do feel a 2G pullout, right?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.480]   So the cost of getting those micro G parabolas
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.280]   is you then have a 2G pullout.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.120]   And that's hard.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.200]   You have to train for it.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.640]   If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.800]   you can strain muscles.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.840]   But I wouldn't say that it's actually
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.220]   a profound, tough thing on the body.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.960]   It's really just an incredibly novel experience.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.480]   And when you're in orbit and you're not having to go
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.840]   through the ups and downs of the parabolic plane,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.920]   there's a real grace and elegance.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.480]   And you see the astronauts learn to operate
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.000]   in this completely new environment.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.400]   - What are some interesting differences
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.840]   between the parabolic plane
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.000]   and when you're actually going up in orbit?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.920]   Is it that with orbit you can look out
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.200]   and see that blue little planet of ours?
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.240]   - You can see the blue marble,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.840]   the stunning overview effect,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.940]   which is something I hope to see one day.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.200]   What's also really different is if you're in orbit
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.080]   for any significant period of time,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.200]   there's gonna be a lot more physiological changes
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.500]   to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.880]   on the Vomit Comet.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.920]   Everything from your bones, your muscles,
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   your eyeballs change shape.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.000]   There's a lot of different things that happen
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.120]   for long duration spaceflight.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.520]   And we still have to, as scientists,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.480]   we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.400]   to be able to keep humans thriving in microgravity
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.120]   or deep duration space missions.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.560]   - Deep duration space missions.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.080]   Okay, let's talk about this.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.240]   I was just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.640]   So approximately how long does it take to travel to Mars?
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.600]   Asking for a friend.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.800]   - Asking for a friend, as we all do.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   About three years for a round trip.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.160]   And that's not that it actually takes that long.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.200]   - Why the round trip?
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.040]   Is that?
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.800]   - Well, you're just asking about the one way trip.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.640]   - Got it, got it, got it.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.680]   - So okay, cool.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.440]   So for just like literally flying to Mars in a round,
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   it takes three years.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.560]   There's some interstitial time there
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.480]   because you really can only go between Earth and Mars
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.560]   at certain points in their orbits
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.440]   where it's favorable to make that journey.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:40.880]   And so part of that three years
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.520]   is you take the journey to Mars a few months,
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.000]   six to nine months.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.400]   You're there for a period of time
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.880]   until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.920]   And then you come back another six to nine months.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.120]   - So one way travel, six to nine months.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.400]   They hang out there on vacation and come back.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.240]   - Forced vacation.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.080]   - Forced vacation.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:58.920]   - You come back.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.960]   - Me, who loves working all the time,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.240]   all vacation is forced vacation.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.080]   All right.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.760]   Okay, so that gives us a sense of duration.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.640]   And we can maybe also talk about longer and longer
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.600]   and longer duration as well.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   What are the hardest aspects of living in space
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.320]   for many days, for let's say 100 days, 200 days?
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.920]   Maybe there's a threshold when it gets really tough.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.880]   What are some stupid little things
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.680]   or big things that are very difficult
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.360]   for human beings to go through?
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.880]   - So one big thing and one little thing.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.480]   And there's two classic problems
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.280]   that we're trying to solve in the space industry.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.840]   One is radiation.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   It's not as much of a problem for us right now
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.320]   on the International Space Station
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.120]   because we're still protected
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.160]   by part of Earth's magnetosphere.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.000]   But as soon as you get farther out into space
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.360]   and you don't have that protection
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.760]   once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.440]   and the cocoon around the Earth,
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.960]   we have really serious concerns about radiation
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   having an effect on human health long-term.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.360]   That's the big one.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.960]   The small one, and I say it's small
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.320]   because it seems mundane,
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.000]   but it actually is really big in its own way,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.080]   is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.480]   And you were alluding to some of the psychological challenges
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.960]   of having humans together on missions
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.400]   and especially as we try to scale
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.160]   the number of humans in orbit or in space.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.360]   So that's another big challenge
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.840]   is how to keep people happy and balanced and cooperating.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.920]   - That's not an issue on Earth at all.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.200]   - At all.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.440]   - Okay, so we'll talk about each of those
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.120]   in a bit more detail,
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.440]   but let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.680]   What about food?
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.680]   What's a good source for food in space?
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.720]   And what are some sort of standard go-to meals, menus?
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.040]   - Right now, your go-to menu
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   is gonna be mostly freeze-dried.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.360]   Every so often, NASA will arrange for a fun stunt
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.920]   or fresh food to get up to station.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.520]   So they did bake DoubleTree cookies with Hilton
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.800]   a couple of years ago, as I recall,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.840]   I think sometime before the pandemic.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.160]   But there's work actually in our lab at MIT,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.160]   Maggie Koblentz, one of my staff researchers,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.600]   is looking at the future of fermentation.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.160]   Everybody loves beer, right?
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.760]   Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.920]   these foods that have just been really important
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.240]   to human cultures for eons
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.560]   because we love the umami and the better flavor in them.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.480]   But it turns out they also have a good shelf life
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.760]   if done properly.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.520]   And they also have an additional health benefit
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.720]   for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.600]   So we're trying to work with NASA
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.280]   and convince them to be more open-minded
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.120]   to fermented food for long-duration deep space missions.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.160]   That we think is one of the future elements
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.560]   in addition to in-situ growing your own food.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.440]   - Okay, this is essential for the space party,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.320]   is the space beer.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.760]   - Yes, it's the fermented product, yes.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.720]   - Okay, cool.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.560]   In terms of water,
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.680]   what's a good source of drinkable water?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   Like where do you get water?
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.880]   Do you have to always bring it on board with you?
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.680]   And is there a compressed, efficient way of storing it?
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.880]   - So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.360]   who's the former administrator of NASA,
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.640]   "This morning's fresh water is yesterday's coffee."
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.440]   So if you think about what that means,
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.160]   you drank the coffee yesterday.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.000]   - Right, as a child.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.840]   So it goes fully through the body.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.120]   - Fully through the body as the recycling system.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.400]   And then you drink what you peed out
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   as clarified, refined fresh water the next day.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.320]   That is one source of water.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.400]   Another source of water in the near neighborhood
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.120]   of our solar system would be on the moon.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.000]   So water ice deposits, there's also water on Mars.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.680]   This is one of the big things that's bringing people
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.200]   to want to develop infrastructure on the moon,
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.800]   is once you've gotten out of the gravity well of earth,
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.360]   if you can find water on the moon and refine it,
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.880]   you can either make it into propellant
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.120]   or drinkable water for humans.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   And so that's really valuable as a potential gateway
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.600]   out into the rest of the solar system
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.840]   to be able to get propellant
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.240]   without always having to ship it up from earth.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.280]   - So how much water is there on Mars?
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.560]   - It's a great question, I do not know.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.400]   - We don't know this yet, right?
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.840]   - I know there's water at the caps.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.200]   I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.720]   that they've done at Mars have a decent idea
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.520]   of what the water deposits look like,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.600]   but I don't know to what degree
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.480]   they have characterized those.
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.320]   - I really hope there's life
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.760]   or traces of previous life on Mars.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.680]   - This is a special spot in my heart
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.960]   because I got to work on SHERLOCK,
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.200]   which is the astrobiology experiment
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.680]   that's on Mars right now,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.520]   searching for what they would say in a very cautious way
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.080]   is signs of past habitability.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.240]   They wanna be careful not to get people overly excited
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.160]   and say we're searching for signs of life.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.480]   They're searching to see if there would have been organics
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.840]   on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.680]   that would have allowed for life to flourish.
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   And I really love this prospect.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   I do think within our lifetimes,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.320]   we'll get a better answer about finding life
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.360]   in our solar system if it's there.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.880]   If not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.240]   - So you like astrobiology.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.080]   - I do.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.320]   - This is part of the,
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.520]   it's not just about human biology,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.600]   it's also other extraterrestrial alien biology.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.440]   - Search for life in the universe.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.280]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.480]   - Does that scare you or excite you?
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.160]   - It excites me, profoundly excites me.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.480]   - That there's other alien civilizations
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.800]   potentially very different than our own?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.680]   - I think there's gotta be some humility there
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.920]   and certainly from science fiction,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.240]   we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.600]   But I do think as a scientist,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.280]   it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life,
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.120]   especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.160]   Right now, we would expect it
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   to be most likely microbial life,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.440]   but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology,
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   which is it may not even be carbon-based life.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.720]   And all of our detectors,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.680]   we only know to look for DNA or RNA.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.400]   How would you even build a detector
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.960]   to look for silicon-based life or different molecules
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.960]   than what we know to be the fundamental molecules for life?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.880]   - And then you mentioned offline Sarah Walker.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.920]   I mean, the question that she's obsessed with
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.880]   is even just defining life.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.600]   What is life to look outside the carbon-based?
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.960]   I mean, to look outside of basically anything
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.320]   we can even imagine chemically,
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.880]   to look outside of any kind of notions
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.820]   that we think of as biology.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.280]   Yeah, it's really weird.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.960]   So you now get into this land of complexity,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   of measuring how many assembly steps
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.120]   it takes to build that thing.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.960]   - Right.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.200]   - And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.880]   of some kind of membrane structures.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.520]   We don't even know which properties life should have,
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.760]   whether it should be able to reproduce
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.800]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.680]   or pass information, genetic type of information.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.520]   We don't know.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.120]   And it's like, it's so humbling.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.680]   I mean, I tend to believe that there could be
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.080]   something like alien life here on earth,
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.640]   and we're just too human biology obsessed
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.000]   to even recognize it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.140]   - The shadow biosphere,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.960]   I remember you and Sarah were talking about.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.240]   - I mean, that's like, speaking of beer,
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.400]   I mean, that's something I wanted to make sure,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.560]   in all of science, to shake ourselves out of,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.160]   like, remind ourselves constantly how little we know.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.120]   'Cause it might be right in front of our nose.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.000]   Like, I wouldn't be surprised if, like,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.320]   trees are, like, orders of magnitude
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.880]   more intelligent than humans.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.280]   They're just operating at a much slower scale,
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.840]   and they're, like, talking shit about us the whole time.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.560]   Like, about silly humans that take everything seriously,
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   and we start all kinds of nuclear wars,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.120]   and we quarrel, and we tweet about it,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.480]   and then, but the trees are always there,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.200]   just watching us silly humans.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.080]   - Like the Ents in "Lord of the Rings."
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.200]   - Exactly.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.640]   So, I mean, I don't know.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.320]   I mean, obviously, I'm joking on that one,
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   but there could be stuff like that.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.720]   Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.000]   the big question, how many, like,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.200]   obviously, nobody knows, but what's your gut,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.960]   what's your hope, as a scientist, as a human,
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.160]   how many alien civilizations are out there?
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.320]   - As a ex-physicist, I'm now much more
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.520]   on the aerospace engineering side for space architecture,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   but as an ex-physicist, I hope it is prolific.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   I think the challenge is, if it's as prolific
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.640]   as we would hope, if there are many, many,
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.960]   many civilizations, then the question is, where are they?
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.760]   Why haven't we heard from them?
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.840]   And the Fermi paradox, is there some great filter
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.560]   that life only gets to some level of sophistication
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.360]   and then kills itself off through war,
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.240]   or through famine, or through different challenges
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.840]   that filter that society out of existence?
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:34.920]   And it would be an interesting question
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.120]   to try to understand if the universe was teeming with life,
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.080]   why haven't we found it or heard from it yet,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:41.920]   to our knowledge?
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.880]   - Yeah, I personally believe that it's teeming with life,
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.920]   and you're right, I think that's a really useful,
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.480]   productive engineering and scientific question
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.520]   of what kind of great filter can just be destroying
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.360]   all of that life, or preventing it from just constantly
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:01.560]   talking to us silly descendants of apes.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.120]   That's a really nice question, like,
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.720]   what are the ways civilizations can destroy themselves?
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   And-- - There's too many, sadly.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.640]   - Well, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.600]   - That's also probably true.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.920]   - That's the thing, it's, I mean,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.880]   and like, if you look at nuclear war, some of it is physics,
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.200]   but some of it is game theory, it's human nature,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.280]   it's how societies built themselves, how they interact,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.680]   how we create and resolve conflict,
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.640]   and it gets back to the human question
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.120]   on when you're doing long-term space travel,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.320]   how do you maintain this dynamical system
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:45.320]   of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.120]   throughout time, to not just maintain the biological body,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.640]   but get people from not murdering each other,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.920]   and like each other sufficiently
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.280]   to where you kinda fit well, but I think, you know,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.440]   if songs or poetry or books taught me anything,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.480]   if you like each other a little too much,
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.240]   I mean, the problems arise,
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.280]   'cause then there's always a third person who also likes,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800]   and then there's the drama, it's like,
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.560]   I can't believe you did that last night, whatever,
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.760]   so, and then there's beer,
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.400]   - Gets complicated quickly. - And it gets complicated
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.240]   quickly, okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions,
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.960]   'cause you answered this, there's an interview
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.520]   where you answer a bunch of cool little questions
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.340]   from young students and so on about like space.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.320]   One of them was playing music in space,
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.280]   and you mentioned something about
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.800]   what kind of instruments you could use
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.640]   to play music in space, could you mention about
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.160]   like does Spotify work in space,
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.120]   and if I wanted to do a live performance,
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.800]   what kind of instruments would I need?
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.320]   - Yeah, I mean, you referenced culture before,
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.960]   and I think this is one of the most exciting things
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.880]   that we have at our fingertips,
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.760]   which is to define a new culture for space exploration,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.600]   we don't just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.480]   to make life worth living in space,
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.120]   and this musical instrument that you referenced
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.200]   was a design of an object that could only be performed
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.200]   in microgravity, - Oh, cool.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   - So it doesn't sound the same way
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   when it's a percussive instrument,
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.760]   when it's rattled or moved in a gravity environment,
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.280]   it is unique. - Can we look it up?
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.640]   - It's called the Telemetron, yeah, it's created by--
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:22.360]   - Of course it's called the Telemetron,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.520]   that is so awesome.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.760]   - Created by Sans Fish and Nicole Lillier,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.520]   two amazing graduate students and staff researchers
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.320]   on my team. - What does it look like?
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.840]   - It looks steampunk, actually, yeah,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.640]   it's a pretty cool design, it looks like
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.720]   it's a geometric solid that has these interesting artifacts
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.240]   on the inside, and it has a lot of sensors, actually,
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.120]   additionally on the inside, like IMUs,
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.960]   inertial measurement sensors, that allow it to detect
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.120]   when it's floating and when it's not floating,
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.480]   and provides this really kind of ethereal,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.000]   they later sonify it, so they use electronic music
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.760]   to turn it into a symphony or turn it into a piece,
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.600]   and yeah, this is the object, the Telemetron.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.400]   - How does a human interact with it?
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.320]   - By tossing it, so it's an interactive
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.400]   musical instrument, it actually requires another partner,
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.400]   so the idea was that it's something like a dance,
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.040]   or just something like a choreography in space.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.720]   - Got it, and speaking of which,
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.440]   you also talked about sports, and ball sports,
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.280]   like playing soccer, so you mentioned that,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.000]   so your muscles can move at full speed,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.520]   and then if you push off the wall lightly,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.160]   you fly across, zoom across, so how does the physics
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.000]   of that work, can you still play soccer,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.480]   for example, in space?
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.280]   - You can, but one of the most intuitive things
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.200]   that we all learn as babies, right,
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.660]   is whenever you throw something,
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.000]   if I was gonna toss something to you,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.720]   I'd toss it up, 'cause I know that it has to compensate
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.680]   for the fact that that Keplerian arc is gonna drop down,
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.900]   the equations of motion are gonna drop down,
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.080]   I would, in space, I would just shoot something
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.320]   directly towards you, so like straight line of sight,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.440]   and so that would be very different
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.600]   for any type of ball sport, is to retrain
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.780]   your human mind to have that as your intuitive
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.400]   arc of motion, or lack of arc.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.280]   - From your experience, from understanding
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.560]   how astronauts get adjusted to this stuff,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.400]   how long does it take to adjust to the physics
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.040]   of this world, this other world?
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.480]   - So even after one or two parabolic flights,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.680]   you can gain a certain facility
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.720]   with moving in that environment,
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.240]   I think most astronauts would say,
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.080]   maybe several days on station, or a week on station,
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.500]   and their brain flips, it's amazing,
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.000]   the plasticity of the human brain,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.160]   and how quickly they are able to adapt,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.360]   and so pretty quickly, they become creatures
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.160]   of this new environment.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.080]   - Okay, so that's cool, it's creating
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.460]   a little bit of an experience, what about if you go
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:43.520]   for more than 100 days, for one year,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.140]   for two years, for three years,
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.120]   what challenges start to emerge in that case?
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.960]   - So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.480]   after he spent a year in space, and he's a twin,
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.000]   it's absolutely fantastic that NASA got to do
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.760]   a twin study, it's perfect.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.800]   So he wrote a lot about his experience
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.040]   on the health side of what changed,
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.960]   things like bone density, muscle atrophy,
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.140]   eyesight changing because the shape of your eyeball changes,
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.960]   which changes your lens, which changes how you see.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.680]   If we're then thinking about the challenges
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.560]   between a year and three years,
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.600]   especially if we're doing that three year trip to Mars
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.420]   for your friend, who asked earlier,
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.000]   then you have to think about nutrition,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.760]   and so how are you keeping all of these different needs
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.600]   for your body alive, how are you protecting astronauts
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.200]   against radiation, either having some type of a shell
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.360]   on the spacecraft, which is expensive because it's heavy,
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.440]   you know, if it's something like lead,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.000]   a really effective radiation shell,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.360]   it's gonna be a lot of mass, or is there a pill
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   that could be taken to try to make you less in danger
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.320]   of some of the radiation effects?
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.100]   A lot of this has not yet been answered,
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.440]   but radiation is a really significant challenge
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.560]   for that three year journey.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.480]   - And what are the negative effects of radiation
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.160]   on the human body out in space?
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.320]   - A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.320]   So you'd probably be able to get there and get back,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.120]   but you'd find yourself in the same way
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.800]   if you were exposed to significant radiation on Earth,
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.500]   you'd find significant bad health effects as you age.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.200]   - What do you think about, like, decades?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.220]   Do you think about decades, or is this, like,
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.840]   an entire human lifetime? - I think about centuries.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.040]   - Centuries? - For my space,
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.280]   but yeah, for decades, I think as soon as we get past
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.640]   the three year mark, we'll absolutely want,
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.160]   somewhere between three years and a decade,
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.680]   we'll want artificial gravity.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.380]   And we know how to do that, actually.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.440]   The engineering questions still need to be tweaked
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.520]   for how we'd really implement it,
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.360]   but the science is there to know how we would spin
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.160]   habitats in orbit and generate that force
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.440]   so even if the entire habitat's not spinning,
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.140]   you at least have a treadmill part of the space station
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.560]   that is spinning, and you can spend some fraction
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.480]   of your day in a near to 1G environment
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.840]   and keep your body healthy.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.480]   - Wait, literally from just spinning?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.200]   - From spinning, yeah, centripetal force.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.560]   - That's fascinating. - So you generate this force.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.600]   If you've ever been in those carnival rides,
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.120]   the Gravitrons that spin you up around the side,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.400]   that's the concept.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.240]   And this is actually one of the reasons why
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.200]   we are spinning out a new company from my MIT lab.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.680]   - Spinning out, ha. - Spinning out, ha.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.080]   That was an accidental but well-noted space pun.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.740]   It's impossible to avoid. - Dad jokes, all right.
[00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.920]   - But yeah, we're spinning out a new company
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.880]   to look at next-generation space architecture
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.640]   and how do we actually scale humanity's access to space,
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   and one of the areas that we wanna look at
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.160]   is artificial gravity.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.000]   - Is there a name yet?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:35.840]   - Yep, there's a name.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.660]   We are brand new.
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.880]   We are just exiting stealth mode,
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.040]   so your podcast listeners will literally be among
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.640]   some of the first to hear about it.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   It's called Aurelia Institute.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.640]   - Beautiful.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.360]   - Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis,
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.020]   and the idea with this is that we, humanity, collectively,
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.660]   are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,
[00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.740]   like a chrysalis, into a space-faring species.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.940]   And so we felt that this was a good time,
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.380]   a necessary time, to think about
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.140]   next-generation space architecture,
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.140]   but also Starfleet Academy,
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.240]   if you know that reference from Star Trek.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:16.380]   - Yes, so let me ask a silly-sounding,
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.400]   ridiculous-sounding, but probably extremely important
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.520]   question, sex in space, including intercourse,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.780]   conception, procreation, birth,
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.200]   like being a parent, like raising the baby.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.120]   So basically, from birth, well,
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.600]   from the before-birth part,
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:34.780]   like the birds and the bees and stuff,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.480]   and then the whole thing, how complicated is that?
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.020]   I remember looking at the, thank you.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:46.000]   I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page, actually,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.320]   and I remember being, the Wikipedia page is sex in space,
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.640]   and fascinated how difficult of an engineering problem
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.720]   the whole thing is.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.360]   Is that something you think about, too,
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.800]   how to have generations of humans,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.720]   self-replicating organisms?
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   - Societies, yes, we are. - Yeah, societies, essentially.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.800]   I mean, I guess with micro,
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.480]   like if you solve the gravity problem,
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   you solve a lot of these problems.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.320]   - That's the hope, yeah, is like the central challenge
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.680]   of microgravity to human reproduction,
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:16.680]   but we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.840]   which is the space event that we run at MIT,
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.600]   and we always do one on pregnancy in space,
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.440]   or motherhood, or raising children in space,
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.760]   'cause there are huge questions.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.120]   There've been a few mammal studies
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.120]   that have looked at reproduction in space,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.520]   but there are still really major questions
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.320]   about how does it work, how does the fetus evolve
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.480]   in microgravity if you were pregnant in space?
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.560]   And I think the near-term answer is just gonna be
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.960]   we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.240]   for that phase of our development.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:49.280]   - Yeah, so there's some studies on mice in microgravity,
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.200]   and it's interesting, like I think the mice,
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.200]   like one of them, the mice weren't able to walk,
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.400]   or like their understanding of physics, I guess,
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.600]   is off or something like that.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.960]   - Yeah, the mental model, when you're really young
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.480]   and you're kind of getting your mental model of physics,
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.040]   we do think that that would change kids' abilities
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.040]   to if they were born in microgravity,
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.120]   their ability to have that intuition
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.880]   around an Earth-based 1G environment might be missing,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.360]   'cause a lot of that is really crystallized
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.820]   in early development, early childhood development.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.040]   So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   - So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.480]   on another planet, on the moon, but let's go to Mars?
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.920]   First of all, does that excite you,
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.440]   humans going to Mars, like stepping foot on Mars?
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.800]   And when do you think it'll happen?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.840]   - It does excite me.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.880]   I think visionaries like Elon are working to make that
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.800]   happen in terms of building the road to space.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.440]   We are really excited about building out
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.400]   the human lived experience of space once you get there.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.160]   So how are you gonna grow your food?
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.200]   What is your habitat gonna look like?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.600]   I think it's profoundly exciting,
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.960]   but I do think that there's a little bit
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:02.420]   of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.960]   being anything like a replacement for Earth.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.280]   So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:10.040]   of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.600]   But Mars is not in its current state
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.760]   a good home for humanity.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.400]   Too many perchlorates in the soil,
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.560]   you can't use that soil to grow crops.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.820]   Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can't breathe it,
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.420]   but it's also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.240]   A lot of different challenges that would have to be
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.280]   fundamentally changed on that planet to make it a good home
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.360]   for a large human civilization.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.040]   - How does a large civilization of humans get built
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:41.520]   on Mars and what do you think it gets,
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.540]   starts being difficult?
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.240]   So can you have a small base of like 10 people essentially,
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.840]   kind of like the International Space Station
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.760]   kind of situation?
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:53.240]   And then can you get it to 100 to 1,000 to a million?
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.640]   Are there some interesting challenges there
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.920]   that worry you, saying that Mars is just not a good backup
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.000]   at this time for Earth?
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.060]   - I think small outposts, absolutely, like McMurdo, right?
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.540]   So we have these models of really extreme environments
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.760]   on Earth in Antarctica, for example,
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.360]   where humans have been able to go
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.460]   and make a sustainable settlement.
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.460]   McMurdo style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 2030s.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.080]   So we wanna send the first human missions to Mars
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.640]   and maybe as early as the end of this decade,
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.760]   more likely early 2030s.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.080]   Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.040]   where like an entire human life would be lived,
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.440]   where it's not just you go for a three month deployment
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:34.400]   and you come back,
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.820]   that is actually the big challenge line,
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.420]   is just saying, is there enough technological sophistication
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:44.520]   that can be brought that far out into space?
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.540]   If you imagine your electronics break,
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.860]   there's no Radio Shack, this dates me a little bit
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.360]   that my mind jumps to Radio Shack,
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.140]   but there's no supply chains on Mars
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.100]   that can supply the level of technological sophistication
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.100]   for all the products that we rely on on day-to-day life.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.940]   So you'd be going back to actually a very simple existence,
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.000]   more like pioneer life out West
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.700]   in the story of the US, for example.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.140]   And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings
[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.180]   of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space,
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:17.660]   is actually gonna be in microgravity,
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.580]   floating space cities,
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:24.580]   not so much trying to establish settlements on the surface.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.500]   - So you think sort of a significant engineering investment
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.420]   in terms of our efforts and money
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   should be on large spaceships
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:40.060]   that perhaps are doing this kind of self-assembly,
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.940]   all these kinds of things, and doing it in orbit,
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.460]   maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.300]   - Yeah, that is the goal.
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.220]   And I think the current political climate
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:52.340]   is such that you can't get the trillion dollar investment
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:54.340]   to build, to start from scratch
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.740]   and build the sci-fi megastructure.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.980]   But if you can build it in fits and starts,
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.020]   in little different pieces,
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.020]   which is another advantage of self-assembly,
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.140]   it's much more like how nature works.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.700]   So it's biomimicry inspired way
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.740]   for humanity to scale out in space.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.700]   - And whether it's out in space or on Mars,
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.300]   the idea that sort of two people fall in love,
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.440]   they have sex,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.580]   a child is born,
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.980]   and then that couple has to teach that child
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.620]   that like we, that they came from Earth.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:30.540]   I just love the idea that somebody is born on Mars
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.020]   or out in space, and you have to be like,
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.380]   that this is not actually like the original home,
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.380]   just them looking at Earth
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.260]   and being like, this is where we came from.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.060]   I don't know, that's really inspiring to me.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.620]   And the child being really confused
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:45.780]   and then wanting to go back to TikTok,
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.500]   or whatever they do.
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.100]   - Whatever they do in that era.
[00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.500]   I mean, there's great sci-fi, right,
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.960]   about people being born on Mars,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.980]   and because it's a lower gravity environment,
[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.820]   they're taller, they're more gangly,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.220]   if they were actually able to develop there,
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.360]   and then they come back to Earth,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.380]   and they're like second-class citizens,
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.060]   'cause they can't function here in the same way,
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.060]   'cause the gravity's too strong for them.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.800]   You see this in series like "The Expanse"
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.100]   with the Belters and these different societies
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.860]   that if we were to succeed in having human societies
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:14.960]   grow up in different pockets,
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.880]   it's not necessarily going to be easy for them
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.380]   to always come back to Earth as their home.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.780]   - Yeah, different cultures form,
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.460]   which is the positive way of phrasing it,
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.700]   but it's also, this human history teaches us
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.380]   that we like to form the other,
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.180]   so there's this kind of conflict that naturally emerges.
[00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:35.260]   Let me ask another sort of dark question.
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.020]   What do you think about, coming from a military family,
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:43.340]   there's still, sadly, wars in the world.
[00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:46.460]   Do you think wars, military conflicts,
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:51.340]   will follow us into space, wars between nations?
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:54.060]   Like, from my perspective currently,
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.740]   it just seems like space is a place for scientists
[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:00.140]   and engineers to explore ideas,
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.700]   but the more and more progress you make,
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.980]   does it worry you that nations start to step in
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.780]   and form, you know, that go out,
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:13.320]   unfold military conflict, whether it's in cyberspace,
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.420]   in space, or actual hot war?
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.900]   - I am really concerned about that,
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.020]   and I do think for decades,
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.220]   the scientific community in space has hung on
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.000]   to this notion from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.400]   which is space is the province of all humankind,
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.800]   peaceful uses of outer space only,
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.000]   but I do think the rise in tensions
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.340]   and the geopolitical scene that we're seeing,
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.980]   I do, yeah, I do harbor a lot of concern
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:44.860]   about hot wars following humanity out into space,
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.340]   and it's worth trying to tie nations together
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.960]   with more collaboration to avoid that happening.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.760]   The International Space Station is a great example.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.500]   I think it's something like 18 countries
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.040]   are party to this treaty.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.340]   It might be less, it might be more,
[00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:01.120]   and then of course, there's a smaller number of countries
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:02.620]   that actually send astronauts,
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.640]   but even at the fall of the Soviet Union
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.900]   and through some tense times with Russia,
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:10.700]   the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.960]   were actually able to collaborate between Mir and ISS.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.060]   I think it'd be really important right now, in particular,
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.600]   to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.500]   in the world and developing world nations
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.740]   can come and collaborate on the future of space
[00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.560]   and purposefully intertwine our success
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.320]   so that there's a danger to multiple parties
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.940]   if somebody is a bad actor.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.540]   - So we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine,
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:37.900]   and I haven't been sleeping much.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:42.900]   I have family, friends, colleagues in both countries,
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.500]   and I'm just talking to a lot of people,
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.780]   many of whom are crying, refugees,
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:53.100]   and there's a basic human compassion and love
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.800]   for each other that I believe technology
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.160]   can help catalyze and accelerate,
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.440]   but there's also science.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.160]   There's something about rockets.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.800]   There's something about, and I mean like space exploration,
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.800]   that inspires the world about the positive possibilities
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:15.600]   of the human species.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.760]   So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.840]   and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   it seems like collaborating on giant space projects
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.080]   is one way to escape these wars,
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.680]   to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.400]   I mean, there's so much camaraderie to the whole thing,
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   and even in this little period of human history
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.440]   we're living through, it seems like that's essential.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.680]   Even through this pandemic,
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.160]   there is something so inspiring
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.240]   about those like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.400]   - It's true.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.120]   - This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.920]   by the commercial sector.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.760]   I don't know.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:03.160]   That was, as many of us have,
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.400]   sort of some dark times during this pandemic,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:10.120]   just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.640]   and just hopelessness and politics,
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:15.720]   and then you look at those rockets going up
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.160]   and it just gives you hope.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.400]   So I think that's an understated sort of value
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.960]   of space exploration,
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.360]   is the thing that unites us and gives us hope.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.160]   Obviously also inspires young generations
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.520]   and young minds to also contribute
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.040]   in not necessarily in space exploration,
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.440]   but in all of science and literature and poetry.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.160]   There's something about when you look up to the stars,
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.800]   it makes you dream.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:40.640]   - Very true.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.600]   - And so that's a really good reason
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.080]   to sort of invest in this,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.160]   whether it's building giant megastructures,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.440]   which is so freaking cool,
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.680]   but also colonizing Mars.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.000]   Yeah, it's something to look forward to,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.840]   something that,
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:02.080]   and not make it a domain of war,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.560]   but a domain of human collaboration
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.840]   and human compassion, I think.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.240]   You're the founder and director
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.280]   of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.480]   It includes a ton of projects.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.760]   So I just wanted to,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.560]   they're focused, I guess, on life in space
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.200]   from astrobiology, like we talked about, to habitats.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.840]   Are there some other interesting projects,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.360]   part of this initiative that you are,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.320]   that pop to mind that you find particularly cool?
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   - Absolutely.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.360]   One is the future of in-space manufacturing.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.760]   So if we're gonna build large-scale space structures,
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.800]   yes, it's great to ship them up from Earth
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.240]   and self-assemble them.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.880]   But what about extrusion in orbit?
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.800]   It's one of the best technologies
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.280]   to leverage in microgravity
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:48.480]   because you can extrude a particularly long beam
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.040]   that would sag in a normal gravity environment,
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.600]   but might be able to become the basis of a truss
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.080]   or a large-scale space structure.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.960]   So we're doing miniature tests of extrusion
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.320]   and are excited to fly this
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.880]   on the International Space Station in a few months.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.320]   We are working on swarm robots.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.880]   We have just announced, actually, MIT's return to the moon.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.480]   So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.960]   going back to the surface of the moon
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.440]   as early as the end of this year, 2022,
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.440]   maybe early 2023,
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.640]   and trying to take data from our research payloads
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:24.440]   at this historic South Pole site
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.120]   where NASA's supposed to send the first humans back
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.200]   on the Artemis III mission.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.960]   So our hope is to directly support
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.120]   that human mission with our data.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.400]   - How does that connect to the swarm aspects?
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.240]   Does it connect?
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.080]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.400]   So we're actually gonna fly one of the little astro-ants,
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.840]   that's the current plan,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.400]   one of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.240]   that's part of the mission.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.680]   - Ants riding a rover?
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.200]   - Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.900]   That rover gets packed in a lander.
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.040]   That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.440]   So it's a whole nesting doll situation to get to the moon.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.240]   - Mother of robot dragons.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.680]   - Yes, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.600]   - So this one, a swarm of one?
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.760]   - Swarm of one, exactly.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   We're testing out.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.520]   It's a tech demonstration mission,
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.880]   not a true swarm.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.720]   Yeah, there they are.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.240]   Those are the astro-ants.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.600]   - Wow, and this was a distributed system,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.200]   and in theory, you could have a ton of these.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.920]   - Yes, these could also be centralized.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.440]   So they have wireless technology
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.840]   that could also talk to a central base station,
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.540]   and we'll be assessing, kind of case by case,
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.880]   whether it makes sense to operate them
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.120]   in a decentralized swarm,
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.840]   or to command them in a centralized swarm.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.220]   - Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels,
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.720]   which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface,
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.760]   so you can operate basically in any environment.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.000]   - He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.840]   on different materials in a microgravity environment.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.920]   - On the vomit comet prior to going to the moon.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.360]   - That must look so cool.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.840]   So they're basically moving along
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.080]   different metallic surfaces.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.460]   It's interesting when you, just a minute ago,
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.320]   talking about the reflection of
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.900]   how space can be so aspirational and so uniting.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.700]   There's a great quote from Bill Anders
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.320]   from the Apollo 8 mission to the moon,
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.640]   which is he, it's the Earthrise photo
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.200]   that was taken where you see the Earth
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.800]   coming up over the horizon of the moon,
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.760]   and the quote is something along the lines of,
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.120]   "We came all the way to discover the moon,
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.900]   "and what we really discovered was the Earth."
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.080]   This really powerful image looking back.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.360]   And so we're also trying to think for our lunar mission,
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.560]   we realize we're a very privileged group at MIT
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.280]   to get the opportunity to do this.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.040]   How could we bring humanity along with us?
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.080]   And so one of the things we're still testing out,
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.760]   I don't know if we're gonna be able to swing it,
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.560]   would be to do something like a Twitch Plays Pokemon,
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.920]   but with the robot.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.560]   So let a lot of people on Earth actually control the robot,
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.960]   or at least benefit from the data that we're gathering,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.000]   and try to release the data openly.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.540]   So we're exploring a couple of different ideas
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.320]   for how do we engage more people in this mission.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.420]   - That would be surreal to be able to interact
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.880]   in some way with the thing that's out there.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.480]   - Exactly. - On another surface.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.680]   - Direct connection. - Direct connection.
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.280]   I think about artificial intelligence in that same way,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.280]   which is like building robots puts a mirror to us humans.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.560]   - Certainly.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.520]   - It makes us wonder about what is intelligence,
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.640]   what is consciousness,
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.560]   and what is actually valuable about human beings.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.320]   When an AI system learns to play chess better than humans,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.760]   you start to let go of this idea
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.800]   that humans are special because of intelligence.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.680]   It's something else.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.160]   It's maybe the flame of human consciousness.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.680]   It's the capacity to feel deeply,
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.840]   to both suffer and to love, all those things.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.840]   Somehow AI to me puts a mirror to that.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.880]   You mentioned HAL 9000.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.080]   You have to bring it up.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.520]   With these swarm bots crawling on the surface
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.080]   of your cocoon in space.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:50.920]   - Right.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.840]   - I mean, all right, let me steel man
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.680]   the HAL 9000 perspective here.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.520]   - Okay.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.160]   - The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission,
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.240]   and the astronauts were,
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.720]   I mean, I don't know if people often talk about that,
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.960]   but you know, like doctors have to make difficult decisions.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.640]   So when there's limited resources,
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.040]   you actually do have to sacrifice human life often
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.000]   'cause you have to make decisions.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.840]   - Right.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.160]   - And I think HAL is probably making that kind of decision
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.840]   about what's more important,
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.240]   the lives of individual astronauts or--
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.080]   - The mission.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:26.920]   - The mission.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.240]   And I feel like AI and other humans
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.000]   will need to make these decisions.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.160]   And it also feels like AI systems
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.920]   will need to help make those decisions.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.200]   I don't know.
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.680]   I guess my question is about
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.020]   greater and greater collective intelligence by systems.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.560]   Do you worry about that?
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.720]   What is the right way to sort of solve this problem,
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.000]   keeping a human in the loop?
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.480]   Do you think about this kind of stuff?
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.360]   Or are they sufficiently dumb now,
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.480]   the robots that's not yet on the horizon to think about?
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.840]   - I think it should be on the horizon.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.560]   It's always good to think about these things early
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.280]   because we make a lot of technical design decisions
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.160]   at this phase working with swarm robots
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.840]   that it would be better to have thought about
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.320]   some of these questions early in the life cycle of a project.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.600]   There is a real interest in NASA right now
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.640]   thinking about the future of human robot interaction, HRI,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.940]   and what is the right synergy
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.800]   in terms of level of control for the human
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.120]   versus level of dependence or control for the robot?
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.560]   And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.080]   For example, the Gateway Space Station,
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.900]   which is meant to be in orbit around the moon
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:40.680]   as a staging base for the surface operations,
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.640]   is meant to be able to function autonomously
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.360]   with no humans in it for months at a time
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.800]   'cause they think it's gonna be seasonal.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.160]   They think we might not be constantly staffing it.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.800]   So this will be a really great test of,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.460]   I don't know that anybody's yet worried
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.280]   about how 9,000 evolving,
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.780]   but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.840]   that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.140]   while the humans are away.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.640]   Or detection algorithms that are gonna say,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.960]   if you had a human pilot,
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.920]   they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.280]   There'll be a lot of autonomous navigation
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.800]   that has to happen.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.160]   That'll be one of the early test beds
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.640]   where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.400]   - Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.760]   especially when the I includes almost friendship
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.560]   because people don't realize this, I think,
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.840]   that we humans long for connection.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.320]   And when you have even a basic interaction
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.280]   that's just supposed to be just serving you or something,
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.720]   you still project,
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   it's still a source of meaning and connection.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.040]   And so you do have to think about that.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.700]   I mean, how 9,000,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.960]   the movie maybe doesn't portray it that way,
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.800]   but I'm sure there's a relationship there
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.240]   between the astronauts and the robot,
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.800]   especially when you have greater and greater level
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.720]   of intelligence.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.960]   And maybe that addresses the happiness question too.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.280]   - Yeah, I think there's a great book by Kate Darling,
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.200]   who's one of my colleagues at MIT.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.480]   - Yeah, she's amazing.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.500]   She's already been on this podcast,
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.840]   but we talk all the time and we're supposed to talk
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.160]   and we've been missing each other
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.000]   and we're gonna make it happen soon.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   - Yeah.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.520]   - Come down to Texas, Kate.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.360]   All right.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.280]   Anyway, yeah, she's amazing.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.120]   And she has this book,
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.160]   and she has her whole work is about this.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.520]   - Connection with robots, yeah.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.440]   - This beautiful connection that we have with robots.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.580]   But I think it's greater and greater importance
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.240]   when it's out in space.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.920]   'Cause it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:35.760]   - Right.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.360]   One of the projects in the book that I gave you,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.640]   which is a catalog of the projects that we've worked on
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.720]   over the last five years,
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.920]   is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.320]   And one of the first years in 2017
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.880]   that we flew a zero-g flight,
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.680]   we took the social robot along
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.840]   and tried to do a little bit of a very scaled down
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.080]   human study to look at these questions.
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.880]   Because you do imagine that we would form a bond,
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.860]   a real bond with the social robots
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:01.600]   that might be not just serving us on a mission,
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.480]   but really be our teammates on a future mission.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.640]   And I do think that that could have a powerful role
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   in the mental health and just the stability of a crew
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.880]   is to have some other robot friends come along.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.320]   - What do you, by the way, the book you mentioned
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.320]   is "Into the Anthropocosmos,"
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:22.000]   a whole space catalog from the space catalog.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.840]   - Get that reference.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.280]   - Yeah, so call it to Earth catalog,
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.360]   a whole space catalog
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.500]   from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.920]   What about the happiness?
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.960]   You said that that's one of the problems
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.920]   of when you're out in space.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.520]   How do you keep humans happy?
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.880]   Again, asking for a friend.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.720]   - Yes.
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.160]   I mean, one of the big challenges is
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.540]   you can't just open a window or walk out a door
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.960]   and blow off steam, right?
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.320]   You can't just go somewhere to clear your head.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.800]   And in that sense, you need to build habitats
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.960]   that are homes that really care for the humans inside them
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.280]   and have, whether it's biophilia
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.040]   and a place where you can go and feel like you're in nature
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.960]   or a VR headset, which for some people is a poor simulcrum,
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.240]   but is maybe better than nothing.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.600]   You need to be thinking about
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.960]   these technological interventions
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.000]   that are gonna have to be part of your home
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.760]   and be part of your maybe day-to-day ritual
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.800]   to keep you steady and balanced and happy
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.340]   or feeling fulfilled.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.620]   - What about other humans, relationship with other humans?
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.060]   Do those get weird
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.420]   when you get past a certain number of humans?
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.700]   - I'm not an expert in this area,
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.100]   but an anecdote that I'll share,
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.300]   my understanding is that NASA has still not decided
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.460]   whether it's better to send married couples
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.120]   or single crew members in terms of
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.120]   you want some level of stability,
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.620]   you don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.660]   like you're alluding to before,
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.660]   but they can't decide because married couples also fight
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.100]   and have a really tough dynamic.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.420]   And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.540]   about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.820]   And we're starting to test some of these things
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.180]   with the civilian crews
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.780]   that are going up with Inspiration4,
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:04.940]   like last fall with SpaceX and Axe-1
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:07.380]   that's gonna fly in a few days here in March.
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:10.920]   As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.060]   I think we'll start to learn a little bit more about
[01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.780]   just average everyday human-to-human dynamics
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.300]   and not the astronauts that are themselves selected
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.580]   to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.060]   easy to get along with.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.340]   - I wish we collected more data about this pandemic
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.220]   because I feel like it's a good rough simulation
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.420]   of what it'd be like out in space.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.500]   A lot of people were locked down, some married couples.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.340]   I think a lot of marriages broke up,
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.600]   a lot of marriages got closer together.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:43.100]   And then the single people, some of them went off the cliff
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.660]   and some of them discovered their new happiness
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.820]   and meaning and so on.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:50.100]   It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.580]   Is there a thorough way to really test that?
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.780]   'Cause it's such a costly experiment.
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.800]   Send humans up there,
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.540]   but I guess you can always return back to Earth
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.740]   if it's not working out.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:03.580]   - That's what we hope.
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:04.400]   (laughs)
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.500]   That's what we hope, you don't have like a Apollo 13
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.040]   situation that doesn't quite make it back.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.920]   But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.540]   The moon is only three days away.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.260]   That's a lot quicker to recover from
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:17.020]   if there's a psychological problem with the crew
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.380]   or any type of maintenance problem, anything.
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:23.700]   Three years is such a challenge
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.020]   compared to these other domains
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.240]   that we've been getting more used to
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.940]   in terms of human space flight.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.540]   So this is a question that we will need to have explored
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.020]   more before we start really sending crews to Mars.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.140]   - So you're a young scientist.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:41.140]   Do you think in your lifetime you will go out into orbit,
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:47.340]   you will go out beyond into deep space
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.380]   and potentially step, you,
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.300]   I don't know if you can call yourself a civilian.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.740]   I don't know if that's what you count as,
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.740]   but you as a curious aunt from MIT, land, step on Mars.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:04.500]   - Yes.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.340]   (laughs)
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.180]   That's a firm, that's a firm--
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.020]   - Are you coming back?
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:08.840]   - Firm, yes.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.680]   Yeah, I'm coming back.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.520]   I don't want that one-way mission,
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.100]   I want the two-way mission.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.220]   But yes, I mean, I think we're already talking
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.260]   about a pretty near-term opportunity
[01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.900]   where I could send graduate students
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.140]   to the International Space Station.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:19.980]   - First, okay.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:21.260]   (laughs)
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.100]   - Not a sacrifice, but send graduate students--
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:25.940]   - For the experience.
[01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:26.940]   - For the experience.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.420]   Send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.
[01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.720]   I do think you and I both would have an opportunity
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.640]   to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.620]   And there's a good chance if we really wanted to,
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.740]   we might have to really advocate for it,
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.260]   apply to an astronaut program.
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.100]   There will be some avenues for humans
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.780]   in our lifetime to go to Mars.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.060]   - What's the bar for health?
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.380]   Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.300]   in terms of how healthy, how athletic,
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.860]   like how, the psychological profile,
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.980]   all those kinds of things?
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.580]   - Yeah, for one, we're gonna build more robust habitats
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.340]   that don't depend on astronauts
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.300]   being so impeccably well-trained.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.260]   So we're gonna make it better for inclusion
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.460]   and just opening access to space.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.780]   But there's a fantastic group called Astro Access
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.500]   that is already helping disabled space flyers
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.380]   do zero-G flights and potentially get access to the ISS.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.740]   And some of the things that we think of as disabilities
[01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.780]   on Earth are hyper abilities in space.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.500]   You don't need really powerful legs in space.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.760]   What you'd really benefit from having is a third arm,
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.380]   more ways to kind of move yourself around
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.640]   and grip and interact.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:38.060]   So we are already seeing a much more open-minded approach
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.020]   to who gets to go to space.
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.900]   And Astro Access is a wonderful organization
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.460]   doing some of that work.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.580]   - I'm hoping introversion
[01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.660]   will also be a superpower in space.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.980]   Okay, well, first I'd love to get your opinion
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.780]   on commercial space flight,
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:54.180]   what SpaceX, what Blue Origin are doing.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.700]   And also another question on top of that is,
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.340]   because you've worked with a lot of different kinds
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.860]   of people, culturally, what's the difference between
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:09.940]   SpaceX or commercial type of efforts, NASA, and MIT?
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.780]   - And academia.
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.740]   - And academia.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.420]   - Yeah, so the first part of your question,
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.340]   I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.980]   It has really empowered our program.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:23.500]   So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.580]   and get the money from the grant,
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.940]   and only then can you send a project to space,
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.660]   I got my fundraise, a lot like a startup founder,
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.420]   and I directly buy access to space
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.580]   on the International Space Station
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.220]   through SpaceX or NanoRacks.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.500]   Same with Blue Origin and their suborbital craft.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.720]   Same with Axiom now.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.480]   Axiom's making plans for their own commercial space station.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.200]   It's not out of the realm of possibility,
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.360]   but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.920]   I will rent a module from the Axiom space station
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.000]   or the orbital reef, which is the Blue Origin space station,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.840]   or NanoRacks is thinking about Starlab Oasis.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.000]   There's probably some other companies
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.040]   that I'm not even aware of yet
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.880]   that are doing commercial space habitat.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.800]   So I think that's fabulous.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800]   And really empowering for our research.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.320]   - Is it affordable?
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.760]   So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.800]   for like MIT type of research lab?
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.160]   Does it, you know, or does it need to be a multi-university,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.800]   like a gigantic effort? - Consortium thing.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.760]   - Yeah, consortium thing.
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   - One of the reasons we're spinning out Aurelia
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.600]   is we actually realized it's cheap enough,
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.640]   it doesn't even have to be MIT.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.600]   And we wanted to start democratizing access
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.920]   to these spaceflight opportunities
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.000]   to a much broader swath of humanity.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.160]   Could you take a, you know,
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.600]   Khan Academy educational course
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.800]   about, hey, students around the world,
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.720]   this is how you get ready for a zero-g flight.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.280]   And by the way, come fly with us next year,
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.800]   which is something we're gonna do with Aurelia.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.240]   We're gonna bring, you know,
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.040]   much more just kind of day-to-day folks on zero-g flights
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.600]   and get them access to engaging in the space industry.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.720]   So it's become cheap enough
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.960]   and the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   So that's amazing.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.800]   It definitely doesn't have to be
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.880]   a consortium of universities anymore.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.000]   It depends on what you wanna fly.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.400]   If you wanna fly James Webb,
[01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.840]   a huge telescope that's decades in the making,
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.920]   sure, you need a NASA allocation budget.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.480]   You need billions.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.440]   But for a lot of the stuff in the book
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.560]   and our research portfolio,
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.960]   it's actually becoming far more accessible.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.480]   - So that's commercial.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:21.160]   What about NASA and MIT academia?
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.040]   - Yeah.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:22.880]   I think, you know,
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.680]   people have been worried about NASA the last few years
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.360]   because in some people's minds,
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.560]   they are ceding ground to these commercial efforts.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.320]   But that's really not what's happening.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.520]   NASA empowered these commercial efforts
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.040]   because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.200]   and go to Europa
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.240]   and continue being that really aspirational force
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.400]   for humanity of pushing the boundary,
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.800]   always pushing the boundary.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.800]   And if they were anchored in low-Earth orbit,
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.160]   maintaining a space station indefinitely,
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.760]   that's so much a part of their budget
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.080]   that it was keeping them from being able to do more.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.960]   So it actually is really fantastic for NASA
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.840]   to have grown this commercial ecosystem
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.960]   and then that frees NASA up to go further.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.840]   And in academia,
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.840]   we like to think that we will be able to do
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.400]   the provocative next-generation research
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.040]   that is going to unlock things at that frontier.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.800]   And we can partner with NASA.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.880]   We can go through a program
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.080]   if we wanna send a probe out really far,
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.480]   but we can also partner with SpaceX
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.640]   and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.800]   might look like and how we could design for that.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.760]   - Speaking of projects,
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.320]   maybe are there other projects that pop to mind
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.040]   from the Space Exploration Initiative
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.760]   or maybe stuff from the book, the convention?
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.240]   - Yeah. - Something super cool?
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.760]   I mean, everything we've been talking about is cool,
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   but just something that pops to mind again?
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.480]   - Yeah, so we talked about life in space
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.640]   and you might need more arms than legs.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.760]   One of the projects by Valentina Sumini
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.640]   was an air-powered robotics tail.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.360]   So it's a soft robotics tail
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.960]   that essentially has a little camera on the back end of it,
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.640]   can do computer vision and knows where to grapple,
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.800]   so it's behind you.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.280]   It grapples onto something and holds you in space
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.040]   and then you can actually free up both of your hands to work
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   so we're already starting to think about the design
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.360]   of bionic humans or prosthetics or things
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.200]   that would make you kind of like a cyborg
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.560]   to augment your capabilities
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.120]   when you're in a space environment.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.560]   - How would you control something like that?
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.960]   So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg,
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.240]   but whatever, it's a-- - An additional appendage.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.720]   - Appendage, so how would you,
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.800]   what are ideas for controlling something like that?
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.520]   - Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.360]   - That's cool.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.860]   - Right now it's super manual.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.440]   It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.200]   of inflating as we're testing it,
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.000]   but in the future, if we had a Neuralink,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.040]   I mean, this is something that you could imagine
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.120]   directly controlling, just thinking thoughts
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.400]   and controlling it.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.600]   That's a ways away.
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.400]   - Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side,
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.880]   astrobiology, there's probably agriculture stuff.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.280]   Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.200]   of out in space for survival?
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   Or the robotics architectures, the self-assembly stuff?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.960]   - So kind of combining something we were talking about,
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.000]   you can form these relationships with objects
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.600]   and anthropomorphize.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.800]   One of the things that we're thinking about for agriculture
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.680]   created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT,
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.840]   was this little, it looks like a planet,
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.120]   but it's inspired by, I think, a mandala
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.960]   or Nepalese spinning wheel.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.640]   And you plant plants on the inside
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.120]   and the astronaut has to spin it every day
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:20.860]   to help the plant survive.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.900]   So it's a way to give the astronaut something to care about,
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.280]   something that they are responsible for keeping alive
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.800]   and can really invest themselves in.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.480]   And it's not necessary, right?
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.400]   We have other ways to grow in orbit.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.960]   Hydroponics, liquid medium, trying to keep the liquid
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.320]   around the plant roots is hard
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.920]   'cause there's no gravity to pull it down
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.320]   in a particular direction.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.480]   But what I loved about this project was they said,
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.520]   "Sure, we have ways that the plants could grow
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.820]   "on their own, but the astronauts might wanna care for it
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:49.440]   "in the same way that we have little plants
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.560]   "that come to be important to us, little plant friends."
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.560]   So there's AgriFuge, that's an early model
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.120]   of this manually spinning plant habitat.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.560]   - I guess this is the best of academic research
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.200]   is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.600]   - Wild ideas, yeah.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.320]   - Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.460]   with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed,
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.600]   especially about Starship
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.760]   and all those kinds of engineering efforts.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.680]   What do you think about how damn hard it is
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.600]   to get out of space?
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.840]   Like, are we humans gonna be able to do this?
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.000]   - I don't know, I think it feels like
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.480]   it's an engineering problem, it's a scientific problem,
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.480]   but it's also just a motivation problem
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.480]   for the entire human species.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.600]   And you also need to have superstar researchers
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:40.880]   and engineers working on it.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.000]   So you have to get the best people in the world,
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.280]   inspire them, and starting from a young age and kinda--
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.000]   - It's inculcating us into why we do it.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.440]   - I mean, I guess this way it's exciting.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.400]   You don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.240]   (laughs)
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.360]   We could fail miserably.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.840]   And that, I suppose, I mean,
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.040]   that's where the best of engineering is done,
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.960]   is success is not guaranteed.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.400]   And even if it happens, it might be very painful.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.280]   - I think that's what's so special
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.000]   about what Elon is doing with SpaceX
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.080]   is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.960]   and he'll see the spectacular failures
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:17.560]   on the path to a successful Starship.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.720]   It's something that people have said,
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.040]   "Why isn't NASA doing that?"
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.520]   Well, that's 'cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.200]   and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.280]   at all these different stages.
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.280]   But that level of spiral engineering theory of development
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.640]   isn't super impressive.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.840]   And it's a really interesting approach
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.440]   that SpaceX has taken.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.000]   And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.600]   and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.240]   They're building the road to space.
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.080]   These trailblazers are doing it.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.840]   And now part of the challenge is to get the rest
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.120]   of the public to understand that it's happening.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.320]   A lot of people don't know that we're going back to the moon,
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.560]   that we're gonna send the first woman to the moon
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.820]   within a few years.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.720]   A lot of people don't know
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.760]   that there are commercial space stations in orbit,
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.400]   that it's not just NASA that does space stuff.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.120]   So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.560]   and educated and involved again,
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.920]   kind of like in the Apollo era
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.440]   where it was a big deal for everybody.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.560]   - Well, a lot of that is also one of the big,
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.840]   impressive things that Elon does, I think,
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.560]   extremely well is the social media,
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.360]   is the getting people excited.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.920]   And I think that actually, he's helped NASA step their game
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.580]   up in terms of social media.
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.760]   There's something about, yeah, the storytelling,
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.760]   but also not like, you know, like authentic
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.280]   and just real and raw engineering.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.480]   There's a lot of excitement for that.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:40.600]   Humor and fun also.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.640]   All of those things you realize,
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.120]   the thing that make up the virality of the meme
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.240]   is beautiful.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.760]   You have to kind of embrace that.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.360]   And to me, this kind of,
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.240]   I criticize a lot of companies based on this.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.400]   I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on,
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.080]   and it's just like, there's a caution.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.660]   Like, let us do this like press conference thing
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:08.240]   where when the final product is ready and it's overproduced
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.520]   as opposed to the raw, the gritty just showed off.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.040]   And something that I think MIT is very good at doing
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.560]   is just showing the raw by nature, the mess of it.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.960]   And the mess of it is beautiful.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.800]   And people get really excited and failure is really exciting.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.960]   When the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.120]   that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.080]   And doing all of that on social media
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.720]   and showing also the humans behind it,
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.260]   the individual young researchers or the engineers
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:38.520]   or the leaders where everything's at stake.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.360]   I don't know.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.880]   I think I'm really excited about that.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.840]   I do want MIT to do that more for students
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.280]   to show off their stuff and not be pressured
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.100]   to do this kind of generic official presentation,
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.480]   but show their, become a YouTuber also.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.880]   Like show off your raw research as you're working on it
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.120]   in the early days.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.480]   I hope that's the future.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.300]   Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:07.300]   but these kinds of things I think inspire young people
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:11.280]   to show off their stuff, to show their true self,
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.120]   the rawness of it.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.000]   'Cause I think that's where engineering is best.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.160]   And I think that will inspire people
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.960]   about all the cool stuff we could do in space.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.280]   - I should say, I couldn't agree more.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.960]   And I actually think that this is why we need
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:24.720]   a real life Starfleet Academy right now.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.140]   It was the place where the space cadets got to go
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:31.400]   to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.920]   And we can do it in a much better way.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.160]   There are a bunch of groups that traditionally
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.880]   haven't thought that they could engage in aerospace.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.960]   Whether it's because you were told
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.700]   you had to be into math and science.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.200]   Now we need space lawyers.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.280]   We need space artists like Grimes, right?
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:48.160]   We need really creative, profoundly interesting people
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.740]   to wanna see themselves in that future.
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.220]   And I think it's a big challenge to us
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:55.440]   in the space industry to also do some more diversity,
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.940]   equity and inclusion and show a broader swath of society
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.380]   that there's a future for them
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:01.960]   in this space exploration vision.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.200]   - Let me push back on one thing.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.520]   We don't need space lawyers.
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.360]   I'm just kidding.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.720]   Okay, it's a joke.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:07.880]   - We do, we do, we do.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.480]   - Okay, we do.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.440]   The lawyers are great.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.440]   I love them.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.860]   Okay, let me ask a big ridiculous question.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:17.160]   What is the most beautiful idea to you
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.240]   about space exploration?
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.600]   Whether it's the engineering, the astrobiology,
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:27.600]   the science, the inspiration, the human happiness
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.260]   or aliens, I don't know.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.440]   What do you like inspires you every day
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.640]   in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.320]   - As a ex physicist, what I've always found so profound
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:47.140]   is just that at really, really small scales,
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.240]   like particle physics and really, really big scales,
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.040]   like astrophysics, there are similarities
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.600]   in the way that those systems behave and look.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:59.480]   And there's a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:02.200]   that's just kind of waiting for us to tie together
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.300]   the physics and really understand it.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.780]   That is something that just really captivates me.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.960]   And I would love to, even though I'm now much more
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.520]   on the applied space exploration side,
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.280]   I really try to keep up with what's happening
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.480]   in those physics areas 'cause I think that will be
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.680]   a huge answer for humanity along the lines of
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.520]   are we alone in the universe?
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.240]   - One of the fascinating things about you
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.160]   is you have a degree in physics, mathematics,
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.880]   and philosophy, and now, I don't know,
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.280]   would you call it aerospace engineering maybe kind of thing?
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.940]   So you have it afoot in all of these worlds,
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:41.940]   the theoretic, the beauty of that world,
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.680]   and the philosophy somehow is in there,
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.360]   and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:52.520]   of all these wild ideas, plus your incredible communicator,
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:53.360]   all of those things.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.120]   What did you pick up from those different disciplines?
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.540]   Or maybe I'm just romanticizing
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.400]   all those different disciplines.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.800]   But what is there, what did you pick up
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.200]   from the variety of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.880]   - What I loved about having this chance
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.120]   to do a liberal arts education
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:13.400]   was trying to understand the human condition,
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:16.420]   and I think more designers for space exploration
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.720]   should be thinking about that
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.800]   because there's so much depth of,
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.280]   like we were talking about, issues and opportunities
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.060]   around human connection, human life, meaning in life,
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.400]   how do you find fulfillment or happiness?
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.200]   And I think if you approach these questions
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.280]   just purely from the standpoint of an engineer
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.160]   or a scientist, you'll miss some of what makes it
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.240]   a life worth living.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:40.360]   And so I love being able to combine
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.800]   some of this notion of philosophy
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.680]   and the human condition with my work.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.280]   But I'm also a pragmatist, and I didn't wanna stay
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.680]   just purely in these big picture questions
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.960]   about the universe.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.320]   I wanted to have an impact on society,
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:55.960]   and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:00.960]   and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:04.400]   to really make a positive impact
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.640]   for a broader swath of citizens.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:07.820]   And so that kinda led me from the physics domain
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.340]   to thinking about engineering and practical questions
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:11.240]   for life in space.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.960]   - In physics, was there a dream?
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.120]   Are you also captivated by this search
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.400]   for the theory of everything that kind of unlocks
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:23.560]   the deeper and deeper, in the simple, elegant way,
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:25.320]   the function of our universe?
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.160]   Do you think that'll be useful for us
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.360]   for the actual practical engineering things
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.520]   that you're working on now?
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.360]   - It could be.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.200]   I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad,
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.560]   and we were looking for supersymmetry,
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.040]   which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.640]   And it was sad because my professors
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.200]   were getting sadder and sadder
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.520]   'cause they weren't finding it.
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.080]   They were excluding what we would call this parameter space
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.000]   of finding these supersymmetric particles.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.100]   But the search for what that theory of everything could be,
[01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.440]   or a grand unified theory that kinda answers
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.320]   some of the holes within the standard model of physics,
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.280]   would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.440]   of certain fundamental physical laws
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.960]   that we should be able to build a better understanding
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.720]   of engineering and day-to-day services from that.
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.120]   It might not be an immediately obvious thing.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   When we discovered the Higgs, the Higgs boson,
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.560]   I was there at CERN that day.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.800]   It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.200]   We all waited like nerds overnight in line
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.760]   to get into the announcement chamber.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.720]   I'd never waited for even like a Harry Potter premiere
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.720]   in my life, but we waited for this like announcement
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.840]   of the Higgs boson to get into the chamber overnight.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.800]   But did that immediately translate
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.680]   to technology for engineering?
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.160]   No, but it's still a really important part
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.520]   of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.120]   And so I don't know that it's always immediate,
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:44.620]   but I think it is really critical knowledge
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.960]   for humanity to seek.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:50.640]   - It might just shake up understanding of the world.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:52.840]   - What scares me is it might help us create
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.120]   more dangerous weapons.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:57.640]   So, and then we'll figure out that great filter situation.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.760]   And I still believe that human compassion and love
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.920]   is actually the way to defend against all these
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.720]   greater and greater and more impressive weapons.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.120]   Let me ask a weird question
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.480]   in terms of you disagreeing with others.
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:15.620]   What important idea do you believe is true
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:20.360]   that many others don't agree with you on?
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.080]   Maybe it's a tough question.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:23.800]   You might have to think about that one,
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:26.320]   but it was very specific,
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.800]   like which material to use or something
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.680]   about a particular project,
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.200]   or it could be grand priorities on missions.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:36.920]   I think one you actually mentioned is interesting
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:40.640]   is like the thing we should be looking for
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.000]   is like colonization of space
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.640]   versus colonization of planets, meaning like-
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.520]   - Yes, that's probably my best hot take
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.080]   that people would disagree with me on
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.840]   is life in floating cities
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   as opposed to life on the surface.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.320]   - How do you envision that like spread of humans?
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.720]   'Cause you said at the beginning of the conversation
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.800]   something about like scale, increasing the scale,
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.560]   basically humans in space.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.480]   Are they just like in, they're in orbit
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.640]   and then they get a little farther and farther out.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.760]   Like, do you see these kind of floating cities
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.480]   just getting farther and farther from earth
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.960]   that can always kind of return?
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.000]   But like, if you look a few centuries from now,
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.160]   do you just see us all these like floating cities?
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.000]   - Like Namibia?
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:25.840]   - Yeah. - Correct.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.640]   - And it just kind of envelops the space around us
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.000]   in these like neighborhoods.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.840]   - Yeah, yeah, in these neighborhoods.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.760]   - It's like rural and there's like giant structures
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.960]   and there's small pirate structures
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.480]   and that kind of stuff. - Pirate structures, yeah.
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:43.400]   I think low earth orbit might come to look like that.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.680]   And it's a really interesting regulatory challenge
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.200]   to make sure that there's some cross purposes.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.640]   So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.800]   the more shiny objects in the night sky,
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.320]   the worse it is for astronomers
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.080]   in a really kind of overly simplified case.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.840]   So there's some pushback to this like amoebaing
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.120]   where we just grow kind of incongruously
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.000]   or indiscriminately as an amoeba in low earth orbit.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.640]   Beyond that though, I think we'll grow in pockets
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.200]   where there are resources.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.880]   So we won't just expand around the gravity well of earth.
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.640]   We'll do some development around the moon,
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.240]   some development around asteroids,
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.800]   some development around Mars
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.320]   because there'll always be purposes
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.520]   for which we wanna go down to a physical object
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:28.500]   and study it or extract something or learn from it.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.040]   But I think we'll grow in fits and starts in pockets.
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.200]   Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.800]   like the Lagrange points,
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.880]   which is where we just sent, we, not me personally,
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.160]   but NASA just sent James Webb, the big telescope.
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.020]   I think it's at L2.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.480]   - What's the nice feature about those pockets?
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.480]   - So it's a stable orbit.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.520]   There are several different Lagrange points.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.400]   And so it just requires less energy
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.320]   to stay where you're trying to stay.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.480]   - Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.480]   What's also fascinating is the interaction between nations.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.680]   - That was gonna be--
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.960]   - On that regard, like who owns that?
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:09.200]   Would you say in those floating cities,
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.080]   do you envision independent governments?
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.520]   - That was gonna be my next answer to you,
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.480]   which pushed me harder for a more provocative question
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.320]   where I might disagree with other people.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:22.720]   I don't yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:24.280]   but we are trying to figure out right now
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.840]   what happens to the moon
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.820]   with all of these first come first served actors
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.360]   just arriving and setting precedents
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.520]   that might really affect future access.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.260]   And one example is property rights.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.080]   We do want companies that have the expertise
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.880]   to go to the moon and mine stuff
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.960]   that will help us develop a human settlement there
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.200]   or a gateway, but companies need to know generally
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.800]   that they have rights to a certain area
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:52.900]   or that they have some legal right to sell things
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:53.740]   that they're getting.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.760]   Does that mean we're gonna grant property rights
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.320]   on the moon to companies?
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.720]   Who has the right to give that right away?
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.760]   So there's a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:03.580]   that we have to think about,
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:04.920]   which is why I think we need space lawyers.
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.240]   Maybe that's the true provocative answer
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:08.440]   is I think we need space lawyers.
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.280]   - True.
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.920]   I mean, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.580]   I mean, but those questions again, as you said eloquently,
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.120]   will help us answer questions about here.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:17.960]   - We hope so, yeah.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.920]   - It is a little strange.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:23.100]   I mean, it's obvious, but it's also strange
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.640]   if you look at the big picture of it all,
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.940]   that we draw these like borders around geographical areas
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.340]   and we say, this is mine.
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:34.480]   And then we fight wars over what's mine and not.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.200]   It seems like there's possible alternatives,
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.760]   but also it seems like there needs to be
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.920]   a public ownership of some parts.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.880]   - Something.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:47.280]   - Like, what is it, Central Park in New York?
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:50.540]   Is there something like preserving--
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.400]   - The commons.
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.240]   - Yeah, the commons.
[01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:54.080]   - The commons.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.320]   That's why we titled the book "Into the Anthropocosmos."
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.680]   We know it's a long and kind of a mouthful,
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.360]   but this notion of the Anthropocene.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   We have a lot of commons problems
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.160]   in humanity, how are we treating the earth,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.000]   global climate change?
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.200]   How are we gonna treat and behave in space?
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.920]   How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.120]   And I would love to see an approach to the moon
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.360]   that is commons-based, but it's hard to know
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.960]   who would be the protector or the enforcer of that.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:25.120]   - And if it's, which it will be probably in the early days,
[01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:28.100]   a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.840]   working on Mars, working out in space,
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.100]   it feels like there still needs to be
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:37.440]   a civilian representation of the greater effort
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.720]   or something like that,
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.200]   like where there should be a president,
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.880]   there should be a democracy of some kind
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:43.880]   where people can vote.
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.320]   - Some representative government.
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.200]   - Those are all, again, the same human questions.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.000]   What advice would you give to a young person today
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.840]   thinking about what they wanna do with their life, career?
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.540]   So somebody in high school, somebody in college,
[01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.280]   maybe somebody that looks up to the stars
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.120]   and dreams to one day take a one-way ticket to Mars
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.920]   or to contribute something to the effort.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.800]   - I'd say you should feel empowered
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.080]   because it's really the first time in human history
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:19.940]   that we're at this cusp of interplanetary civilization,
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.240]   and I don't think we're gonna lapse back from it.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:25.200]   So the future is incredibly bright for young people
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.680]   that even younger than you and I
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:27.840]   who will actually really get a chance
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.280]   to go to Mars for certain.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.820]   The other thing I would say is be open-minded
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.380]   about what your own interests are.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.500]   I don't think you anymore have to be shoehorned
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:38.380]   into a particular career
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:41.340]   to be welcomed into the future of space exploration.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.820]   If you are an artist and that is your passion,
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.620]   but you would love to do space art,
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.360]   or if not space art, use your artistry
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.920]   to communicate a feeling or a message about space,
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.440]   that's a role that we desperately need
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.100]   just as much as we need space scientists
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.900]   and space engineers.
[01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.260]   - Well, when you look at your own life,
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.820]   you're an incredibly accomplished scientist,
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:06.260]   young scientist, and you hopped around
[01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:08.940]   from physics to aerospace,
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:11.660]   so going from the biggest theoretical ideas
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.260]   to the biggest practical ideas.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.780]   Is there something from your own journey
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.740]   you can give advice to,
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:22.300]   like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:26.700]   Maybe the role of the university and college
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.460]   and education and learning, all that kind of stuff?
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.180]   - I'd say one piece of advice is find really good teammates
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.340]   because I get to be the one that's talking to you,
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:38.980]   but there are 50 graduate students, staff, and faculty
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:41.700]   that are part of my organization back at MIT,
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.220]   and I'm actually, you guys can't see it on camera,
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:45.620]   but I'm sitting here with my co-founder and COO,
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:48.980]   Danielle DeLotte, and that is really what makes
[01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.640]   these large-scale challenges for humanity possible
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:55.220]   is really fantastic teams working together
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.420]   to scale more than what I could do alone,
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.660]   so I think that that's an important model
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.460]   that we don't talk about enough in academia.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:03.780]   There's a big push for this lone wolf genius figure
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:06.060]   in academia, but that's certainly not been the case
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:06.900]   in my life.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:09.540]   I've had wonderful collaborators and people
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:10.780]   that I work with along the team.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.660]   - Also cross-disciplinary.
[01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:14.620]   - Absolutely, yeah, cross-disciplinary,
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.340]   interdisciplinary, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:19.340]   - Artists, where do artists come in?
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.260]   Do you work with artists?
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.180]   - We do, we have an arts curator
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.220]   on the Space Exploration Initiative side.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.420]   She helps make sure,
[01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:27.000]   partly around that communication challenge
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.580]   that we talked about, that we're not just doing
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.780]   zero-G flights and space missions,
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:34.420]   but that we take our artifacts of this sci-fi space future
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:38.080]   to museums and galleries and exhibits.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.820]   She pushed me to make sure, her name is Xing Liu,
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:44.500]   she pushed me for our first ISS mission.
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.780]   I was just gathering all the engineering payloads
[01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:48.660]   that I wanted to support for the students to fly,
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.260]   including my own work, and she said,
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:52.940]   "You know what, we should do an open call internationally
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.980]   "for artists to send something to the ISS,"
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.780]   and we found out it was the first time.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.140]   We were the first ever international open call
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.260]   for art to go to the ISS, and that was thanks to Xing
[01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.620]   and artists bringing a perspective
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.060]   that I might not have thought about prioritizing.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.060]   - Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.100]   So when you look out there,
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.940]   it's the flame of human consciousness.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.200]   There does seem to be something quite special about us humans.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.780]   First of all, what do you think it is?
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:23.140]   What's consciousness?
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.940]   What are we trying to preserve here?
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:32.100]   What is it about humans that should be preserved,
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:33.920]   or life here on Earth?
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.940]   What gives you hope to try to expand it out
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.100]   farther and farther?
[01:42:39.100 --> 01:42:43.140]   What makes you sad if it was all gone?
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:46.220]   - I think we're a remarkable species,
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:49.860]   that we are aware of our own thoughts.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.780]   We are meta-aware of our own thoughts and of ourselves.
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:54.580]   - We're able to speak on a podcast
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:56.940]   about a meta-awareness about our own thoughts.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.660]   - About our own thoughts, yeah, turtles all the way down.
[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:03.140]   I think that that is a really special gift
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.740]   that we have been given as a species,
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.660]   and that there's a worth to expanding
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:09.540]   our circles of awareness.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:12.140]   So we're very aware of, as an Earth-based species,
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:13.740]   we've become a little bit more aware
[01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:15.980]   of the fragility of Earth and how special a place it is
[01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:18.140]   when we go to the moon and we look back.
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:21.980]   What would it mean for us to have a presence
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.220]   and our purpose in life as a inter-solar system species,
[01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.580]   or eventually an intergalactic species?
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:32.140]   I think it's a really profound opportunity for exploration,
[01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.540]   for the sake of exploration,
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.340]   a real gift for the human mind.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:41.060]   - Yeah, for anything, we're curious creatures.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:44.180]   You do believe we might one day become
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.380]   intergalactic civilization?
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:47.740]   - Long, long time from now.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:50.020]   We have a lot of propulsion challenges
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:51.540]   to answer to get that far.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.220]   - So you have a hope for this.
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:54.820]   - Yeah.
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:56.700]   - Another big, ridiculous question,
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:57.660]   building on top of that,
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:00.300]   what do you think is the meaning of life?
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.900]   This individual life of ours, your life,
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.380]   that unfortunately has to come to an end,
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.100]   as far as we know for now?
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.260]   - Yeah.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:13.940]   - And our life here together, is there a why?
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:18.940]   Or do we just kinda let our curiosity carry us away?
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.620]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.420]   Is there a single kind of driving purpose why,
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:28.060]   or can it just be curiosity based?
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.340]   I certainly feel,
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:31.420]   and this is not the scientist in me talking,
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:34.140]   but just more of like a human soul talking.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:38.500]   I certainly feel some sense of purpose
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.620]   and meaning in my life.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:40.620]   And there's a version of that,
[01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:43.380]   that's a very local level within my family,
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.900]   which is funny, 'cause this whole conversation
[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:47.100]   has been big, grand space exploration themes,
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:48.180]   but you asked me this question,
[01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.100]   and my first thought is what really matters to me,
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:53.540]   my family, my biological reproducing unit.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:56.220]   (both laughing)
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.940]   But then there's also another purpose,
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.820]   like another version of the meaning in my life
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.460]   that is trying to do good things for humanity.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.060]   So that sense that we can be individual humans
[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:06.780]   and have our local meaning,
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.660]   and we can also be global humans,
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.540]   maybe someday like the Star Trek Utopia
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.500]   will all be global citizens.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.500]   I don't wanna sound too naive,
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:17.300]   but there is, I think, that beauty to a meaning
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.140]   and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself,
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.980]   working on something that's bigger and grander
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:23.700]   than just yourself.
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:25.180]   - The deepest meaning is from
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:28.060]   the local biological reproduction unit,
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.300]   and then it goes to the engineering, scientific,
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.260]   what is it, corporate, like company unit
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.420]   that can actually produce and compete
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.660]   and interact with the world.
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.380]   And then there's the giant human unit
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:43.980]   that's struggling with pandemics.
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:45.220]   - And commons.
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.220]   - And together struggling against the forces of nature
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:50.820]   that keeps wanting to kill us.
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.900]   - Yeah, there'd be nothing like an alien invasion
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.980]   to unite the planet, we think.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:57.980]   - I can't wait, bringing on aliens.
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:00.660]   Listen, your work, you're an incredible communicator,
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:01.940]   incredible young scientist, Sarah.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:04.860]   It's a huge honor that you would spend your time with me.
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:07.740]   I can't wait what you do in the future.
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:10.980]   And thank you for representing MIT so beautifully,
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:12.780]   so masterfully, you're an incredible person.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.620]   Thank you for talking to me.
[01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:14.620]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:15.660]   It's been an absolute pleasure.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.660]   It's a great conversation.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:19.180]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.740]   with Ariel Ekblal.

[01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.220]   the Roman Stoic philosopher.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:36.500]   "There is no easy way from earth to the stars."
[01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:40.500]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:43.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:45.700]   (upbeat music)
