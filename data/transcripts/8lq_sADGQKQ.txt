[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.400]   - All right, everyone.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.520]   Welcome, and thanks for being here.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.440]   My name is Gauri.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.680]   I'm on the board of the John C. Bogle
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.840]   Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.840]   and we are thrilled to have this panel of FIRE all-stars.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.400]   Their bios are ubiquitously available,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.680]   so I'll just touch on a few key points,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.520]   starting with Paula Pent.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.520]   She has a master's in journalism from Columbia University.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.280]   Her first job out of college paid $21,000,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.040]   and when she left her last job working for someone else,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.080]   she was making $31,000.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.480]   She quit work to travel the world,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.240]   start the Afford Anything podcast,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.680]   which has, get this, over 30 million downloads,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.840]   and she recently recorded her 500th episode
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.360]   a few months ago.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.080]   We're very grateful to have Paula.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.520]   And she also owns a few rental properties,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.640]   so she has unique firsthand insight with rentals.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.520]   Next, Karsten Jeska has a PhD in economics
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680]   from University of Minnesota.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.540]   Shout out to Minnesota.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.360]   He's worked at both the Fed
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   and Bank of New York Mellon Asset Management,
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.680]   and he's taught at UC Berkeley as well as Emory.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.160]   He retired in his 40s, having achieved FI,
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.760]   and he has over 60 blog posts of over 200
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.760]   that address sequence, safe withdrawal strategies,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.560]   and he has a CFA, so he definitely knows his numbers.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   Next, we have Jackie Cummings Koski.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.880]   Jackie is a CFP and also the author
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   of Wiley's Fire for Dummies.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.840]   They could have chosen any luminary in the fire space.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.780]   They chose Jackie.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.920]   Jackie also escaped poverty, divorce,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.600]   and single parenthood to achieve FI in her 40s,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.200]   so she will provide unique perspectives
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.420]   from all of those aspects.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.000]   And then we have Dr. Jordan Gromit,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.080]   who folks heard in the last panel.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560]   Jordan is a hospice physician,
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.560]   so he has unique insights on what folks regret
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.200]   and don't regret towards the end of their lives.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160]   He's written over 1,000 related blog posts,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.720]   and he has a lot to share on meaning, purpose, and identity.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.480]   He is the author of Taking Stock,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.740]   a hospice doctor's advice on financial independence,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.280]   building wealth, and living a regret-free life,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.040]   and he has another book on its way.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.400]   So with that, we thank the panelists.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   (audience applauds)
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.600]   We're gonna try to touch on things
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.520]   that are less covered in the space,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.280]   but we'll also keep it foundational
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.200]   for folks new to the space.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.840]   So we'll start with, what's the most useful,
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   atypical, personal finance advice you'd like to share?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.960]   Start with Paula.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.800]   - Sure.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.640]   I'd say the most atypical personal finance advice
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520]   is to embrace spending,
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.920]   because I think there's this myth
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   that being quote-unquote good with money
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.480]   means, oh, you just don't spend it.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.080]   Save as much as you can, hoard as much as you can.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.480]   The higher your savings rate, the better.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.800]   But in fact, being good with money
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   means aligning your money with your values.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   And so to the extent that you can spend your money
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.440]   on what you value and don't spend your money
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160]   on things that society pressures you to spend on,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.040]   but that aren't actually important to you,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.440]   the better you are at being a capital allocator.
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.480]   - I think my entire blog is atypical advice,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   but if I had to pick one, I would probably say
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.600]   that if you do a safe withdrawal strategy in retirement,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.120]   you want to personalize that, right?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520]   So you want to take into account your personal parameters,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.320]   your horizon, how much requests do you want to leave,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.640]   how many gifts do you want to give along the way,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.240]   what kind of additional cash flows are coming in or out.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.360]   That makes a huge difference.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.160]   So just the 4% rule of thumb
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.640]   is probably not gonna work for most people.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.840]   It's a good starting point,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.080]   but you should customize it more than that.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.960]   And then on top of that,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.200]   so in addition to these idiosyncratic parameters,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.360]   you also want to look into market parameters, right?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.400]   Are you retiring at the peak of the market
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.640]   or at the trough of the market, right?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.960]   Safe withdrawal rate can't be 4% all the time, right?
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.160]   So you want to be more cautious.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.200]   If you're at the peak of the market,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.640]   you can probably retire with a lot more than a 4% rule
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.680]   if you're retiring say in 2003 or 2009
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   or at the bottom of the market in 2022.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.360]   So that's my atypical advice that shouldn't be atypical.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.800]   - Okay, thank you.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   - I think atypical for me, it would be starting,
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   like when you start your fight journey
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.920]   or you start getting your finances together,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.160]   start with the thing that lights you up the most,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.800]   the things that actually will get you moving.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.440]   Traditional thought is, oh, start with a budget,
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.400]   start with your expenses.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   And that's true, but if you freeze in your tracks
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.360]   and you procrastinate
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.560]   'cause you absolutely hate that thing,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.000]   you're never gonna like move forward.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.680]   So at least start with the thing that you like the most.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.960]   For me, that was investing.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.520]   And all this personal finance stuff comes full circle.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.280]   So you'll eventually get there.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.720]   But I say, start with what is going
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.160]   to actually get you moving.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.440]   - A lot of people dream about FI
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.080]   and whether they achieve it or not,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   sometimes it's very different than their expectations.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   What doesn't FI solve that people expected it to?
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.880]   And what does it solve, whether expected or not?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.560]   - So these are related answers,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.200]   but what it doesn't solve,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.960]   and let me give, before I give you the punchline
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.280]   to that answer, I'll give you some context.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Many people I know use FI for a well-funded career change.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.520]   So they don't necessarily want retirement
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.200]   as defined as a complete permanent
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   and irreversible cessation of income.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.040]   They're not looking for retirement in that context.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.520]   They're looking for a career change,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.800]   perhaps to something that's much lower paying,
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.400]   but that is very well-funded
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.440]   where they have financial security.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.920]   What, and anecdotally, what I've seen a lot
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.240]   of people experience is that they'll change careers
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.480]   into something they think will be more fulfilling,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.520]   but their new boss sucks, you know, just as much.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.320]   Like the day-to-day reality of what they think
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   they're going to enjoy is actually not that great.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.880]   And so FI doesn't necessarily solve that,
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   but to the second part of the question,
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.600]   which is what does it solve,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   it brings into clarity and focus what is important to them.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.840]   So it isn't necessarily as simple as,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.240]   oh, I'm a software engineer,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.880]   but I would really enjoy working at an animal shelter.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.200]   You know, I mean, people might think it's that,
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.480]   but then it actually turns more into,
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.720]   oh, what I actually enjoy is working for an organization
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.640]   in which I have a lot of autonomy.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.080]   You know, it'll bring that into focus more.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.400]   - Yeah, so one thing I always tell people
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.320]   is that if you view FI as getting rid of the job you hate
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.920]   or the job that you're bored in,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.840]   the problem is you might then also hate early retirement
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.600]   and you might be bored in early retirement.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.120]   So it's, maybe the job is not the problem,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   maybe you are the problem,
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.640]   and you might have to change other things in your life.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.480]   And so a few observations from my personal retirement,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.320]   right, when I was working, I always longed this idea.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.600]   So when I'm retired,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   I'm gonna go skiing every day of the week.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.720]   I'm gonna go hiking every day of the week
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.640]   because these are things that I really cared about.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.840]   And now I live in the Pacific Northwest
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.880]   and I have that option every day.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.200]   I'm not even using it as much as I thought I would, right?
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.400]   Because there are other fun stuff to do,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.000]   just taking my daughter to the school bus and picking her up.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.520]   I mean, that's already a great day in my life.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.960]   I don't need that much more than that to make me happy.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.240]   So some of the things that you think you will do
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.040]   in early retirement,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.640]   then you realize you have the option
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.800]   and you're not even going to do it.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.680]   But it's nice to have the option, right?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.440]   Because then what you do is,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   Pacific Northwest, the weather is not always that nice,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.440]   then instead of going every day, right,
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.000]   you wait for the perfect day to go hiking and skiing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.160]   And even though I might actually do less skiing now,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.000]   when I do it, I'll make it count and make it enjoyable.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.440]   But really every day is enjoyable,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   just doing small things and maybe very, very, very small.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.720]   And some people might think meaningless things,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.480]   but that turn out to be very meaningful,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   like hanging out with family, visiting family,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.120]   traveling more.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.320]   And so keep that in mind when you plan for retirement.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.600]   - Yeah, and I think it just doesn't solve
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.080]   your relationship problems.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.920]   People that are Phi, they still get divorced.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.600]   They still have healing that they may have to do
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.080]   with their parents or their kids or friends.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.240]   And so that piece, that Phi stuff,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.880]   it just magnifies who you are.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.400]   So I think it just doesn't really change
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.920]   a whole lot of the relationship stuff
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.160]   that goes a lot deeper.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.960]   - Simple.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   So what are ways to spend that actually provide fulfillment,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.320]   sustainable fulfillment?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.640]   - So I would start, instead of starting with the question,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.720]   how can I spend more money?
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.480]   I would start with the question of,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.520]   what are the things in my life currently
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.560]   that bring me the greatest sense of fulfillment?
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.600]   And what are other ways that I can amplify that
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.360]   or magnify that?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.040]   And by virtue of, if it's how can I spend money,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.640]   it's almost like a solution looking for a problem.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.200]   So I would start instead by flipping that on its head,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.480]   take money out of the equation entirely.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.200]   What are the things that are most fulfilling?
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.560]   How do we make that more?
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.560]   - For us, it's travel.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.640]   So we like to travel very extensively.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.240]   So this year we have a travel budget
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.840]   of I think 10 to 11 weeks.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.520]   So when I say travel budget,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.640]   we don't look at the money.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.320]   Well, the money is there, we can spend that.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   I mean, as long as it's not astronomically expensive.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.880]   So our budget is more in terms of the weeks
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.000]   and the time constraints that we have,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.560]   not so much in terms of the monetary constraints.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.120]   So we spent two weeks in Japan in the spring.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.960]   We just came back from a six week trip to Europe.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.360]   Because I didn't get back to Germany on that trip,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.200]   I flew once more and spent another week in Germany
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.680]   to visit family just recently.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.120]   And then we do another trip in December
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.560]   and do a cruise to the Panama Canal
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.440]   from LA via the canal to Miami.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.000]   So for us, it's travel.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.040]   And then we also try to combine that
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.280]   with having family together.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.400]   So we sometimes make basically family reunions out of that.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.240]   So that's fulfilling to us.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.840]   And we have almost infinite budget to do that.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.000]   - Yeah, I know that that's a hard one for a lot of people.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.480]   I think sort of taking away what's worth spending money on
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.400]   or how do you like switch on this spend versus save
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.800]   is to, I guess think about like,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.520]   think about your values and think about like legacy.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.880]   And that money part to me is just the obstacle
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.920]   that kept you from doing it before.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.400]   And now that you don't have that obstacle,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.160]   wow, how many times would you wanna take a big vacation
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.760]   with your kids or do all the things
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.560]   that you thought about doing when you were young?
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.200]   And you might have to take a walk down memory lane
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.320]   and just say, you know what,
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.360]   the money part is no longer an issue for me.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.800]   So I wanna do it.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.000]   And I feel like it's just gonna take some practice
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.640]   'cause it is a big mindset shift
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.520]   to go from saving your entire life
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.360]   and now you're ready to spend it,
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.560]   but it's just totally worth it.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.360]   Think about kids, grandkids, everyone else in your life.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.440]   - So I think you can't buy your way
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.960]   into becoming who you wanna be, right?
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.480]   So if you wanna be a runner,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.640]   you can buy as nice shoes as you wanna buy,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.360]   but until you start doing the things, you're not a runner.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.960]   But you can use money to clear the way
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.720]   to become the kind of person you wanna be.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.240]   So you can use money to hire a babysitter
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.720]   so you have time to go training,
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.360]   and you can use money to hire a trainer so you're stronger.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.920]   You can use money to pay for your admittance
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.400]   into the Boston Marathon.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.400]   So I think the idea is to use money in support
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   of those things that are most important to us.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.240]   - Hear it.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.840]   So in retrospect, a lot of people who've achieved FI say,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.160]   I sacrificed so much along the way, I was miserable,
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.120]   and even though I'm FI now,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.000]   it wasn't worth sacrificing to the extent I did.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.240]   What, in your experiences, is worth sacrificing,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   and what isn't?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.320]   - So I like the idea of plan for the future,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320]   but don't live in it.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.960]   And I think that what often happens
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.960]   is when we defer happiness, we live in the future.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.880]   And so anything that would cause that,
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.080]   that would cause the negation of the present moment
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.480]   is not worth sacrificing.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   So, I mean, there's the obvious answers
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.960]   of health, relationships, you know that already,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.240]   that's not new information.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.660]   But where that comes into practice on a day-to-day level,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.080]   I think is worthy of constant inquiry,
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.160]   constant re-self-examination.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.600]   And a thought exercise that I really enjoy
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.440]   is what decisions would I make
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.760]   if my lifespan was only five more years?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.400]   And what I like specifically about five more years
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.240]   is that, okay, if it's next week,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   there are certain things that I just can't do by next week.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.640]   But five years is a long enough time span
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.040]   that I can make some serious changes.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.920]   But, you know, but it's not like I don't have the,
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.860]   it doesn't, I don't have the same set of assumptions
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.160]   that I would if I was imagining
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.240]   that I'm gonna live to 100.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.560]   And so, therefore, time is gonna stretch on forever.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.140]   So I use that thought exercise a lot.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.880]   - Yeah, my philosophy is called stealth frugality.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.160]   So we want to be frugal.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.840]   We don't want to waste money on things that we don't need.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.640]   And we're environmentalists, right?
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.400]   We don't want to waste energy, for example.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.880]   But we don't want to be so frugal
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.800]   that people start talking behind our backs.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.840]   So when I announced my retirement at the job,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.280]   there was not a single person who told me,
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.480]   yeah, I knew you were doing that.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.400]   Oh, you're such a penny pincher.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.200]   I tried to do everything that kept me happy socially.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.240]   And, of course, it might have delayed my retirement
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.120]   by about six months, but it was obviously worth it
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.820]   to go out to work lunches and to drive a car
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.520]   that looks like we're actually splurging a little bit,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.760]   but it wasn't actually that expensive.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.320]   And so this is a little bit of a riff
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.120]   at this idea of stealth wealth, right?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.560]   I remember Lief was sitting there,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.520]   he had a brilliant blog post on stealth wealth.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.000]   So we don't want to flaunt our wealth,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.820]   but I don't want to also be so frugal
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.520]   that people think there's something wrong with you.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.100]   And so the stories for people who,
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.880]   basically, there was a lawyer in Seattle
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   who was sharing people's Netflix passwords, right?
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.780]   If you do that as a lawyer
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.480]   and people start talking behind your back,
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.440]   well, she's kind of cutting corners there, right?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.000]   You don't want to do this frugality so much
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.320]   that it even hinders your advancement at the office.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.080]   What I liked about going out for lunch and coffee
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   is you hear the most recent gossip, right?
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.120]   You can rub elbows a little bit
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.320]   with the powerful at the office.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.920]   And, I mean, not in a sleazy way,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   but, I mean, in a positive way.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.920]   And it didn't hamper my retirement saving much,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.200]   but it made the ride much nicer.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.440]   And then on top of that, right?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.640]   So remember this Mr. Money Mustache calculation, right?
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.880]   If you cut your spending to a really tight budget,
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.360]   you get faster to retirement,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.820]   but then you also have to keep that lean budget
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.960]   also in retirement, right?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.560]   I mean, if you already hate it while working, right?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.240]   And that means it's not just until you reach retirement,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.200]   then in retirement, you have to keep that low budget.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.800]   And I think it's maybe don't be too frugal,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.600]   spend on the things that are meaningful to you.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.760]   I mean, I have certain things
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.960]   and you will have certain things
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.040]   and it might delay your retirement.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.000]   And if it's five years, even,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.480]   it's still worth it to have an easier path to retirement.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.840]   And then also in retirement,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.440]   when you keep that little bit more generous budget.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.320]   So it's definitely worth it.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.760]   And by the way, the FIRE community,
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.920]   we almost have to blame ourselves a little bit,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.720]   'cause if you want to become a blogger, right?
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.560]   You almost have to retire early, really, really early,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.120]   right at this, this is the great talking point for you.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.980]   And then you might get an interview
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.320]   with the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.480]   The earlier you move,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.580]   the more are your chances to gain that publicity,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.560]   but we can't all be like that, right?
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.600]   We are all in some way, regular early retirees.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.540]   And so plan the path like you can live with this
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.140]   for the rest of your life, basically.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.120]   - I think that's such a misnomer.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.920]   Like, I know FIRE people get blamed for being frugal
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.760]   and minimalist and all of this stuff.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.320]   And I never felt like I fell within that camp.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.380]   And to me, it's just a matter of prioritizing
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.220]   the things that are important to you.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.040]   And it might be different than someone else.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.080]   Like, you know, we have some FIRE people
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.800]   that might brag about, you know,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.360]   having 300,000 miles in their car.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.520]   That's totally fine, but that's really not what I want to do.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.080]   I want to buy a nicer car,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.880]   but I live in a low cost of living area
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.600]   and my housing costs are pretty low.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.560]   So I never felt like I had to be, you know,
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   an extreme minimalist or extreme frugal,
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.200]   but we get that, you know, avatar, right?
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.600]   So when people are asking me about it,
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.160]   they're like, "I like to spend money."
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.040]   And it's like, you can still spend money.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   It's like, you should never, don't deprive yourself
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.920]   and don't make yourself miserable 'cause guess what?
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.320]   You're not gonna stick with it.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.880]   So, you know, the whole, you know,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.320]   what do you have to give up?
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.640]   And, you know, trying to, you know, cut back on
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.440]   every little thing, that's just not fun.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.920]   And no one wants to stick with that.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.800]   So I'm trying to get rid of that whole thing
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.320]   that seems to be around FIRE.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   And like you said, you know, the media picks up on that.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.440]   They want the most extreme stories.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.800]   And so that's where it comes from.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.360]   So I try to sing a different song to say,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.600]   "Look, you really need to enjoy it."
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.160]   And if I could have retired six months sooner
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.600]   because I cut back my coffee, then fine.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.920]   I don't mind working six months.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.200]   You know, it's just not that big of a deal,
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.880]   but just don't deprive yourself
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.280]   and make yourself miserable.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.560]   - The answer to when you sacrifice too much is burnout.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.280]   And so if you think about it,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520]   anyone who's done something and sacrificed
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.840]   for something they loved or something they believed in,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.720]   it's an act of love.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.480]   You don't burn out when you're doing it as an act of love.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.320]   Difference is when you're doing it for FIRE,
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.080]   you're doing it as an act of love towards yourself.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.880]   And when it stops being an act of love, you burn out.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.240]   And I was a perfect example of this
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.560]   'cause I went through medicine.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.920]   I got burned out very quickly
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.640]   because I just wanted to get to financial independence
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.680]   so fast and I worked so hard.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.920]   And then I had to leave mostly.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.160]   What I found is that I loved a touch of medicine,
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.400]   the piece of doing hospice.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.560]   What if I had found that in the beginning?
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.600]   Like I would have never burned out.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.680]   I would have probably never left.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.960]   I wouldn't have gotten to financial independence as quickly,
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.920]   but it probably wouldn't have been necessary.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.960]   And so I think if you find yourself burning out,
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.680]   you've gone too far.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.600]   If the excitement, if you're sacrificing
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.120]   and you're excited about it and you're like,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.640]   this is an act of love towards myself or my family
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.800]   and it feels good, then you're probably doing fine.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.200]   - Clearly work provides a lot of meaning, purpose,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.800]   and identity for folks.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.120]   And Jordan touched on this in the last session.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.000]   How should folks prepare for lack of meaning, purpose,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.240]   and identity in the absence of work?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.240]   - I'd say don't prepare for the lack of it,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.000]   prepare for a shift in it.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   So don't retire away from something, retire into something.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.880]   So you don't want to be rudderless,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.800]   like you don't want to be going nowhere.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.280]   Have a thing, and that thing can change.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.840]   That thing likely will change.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.960]   But just have a thing that you're doing
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.400]   that gives you some type of purpose.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.080]   - Yeah, so I am fortunate, right,
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.720]   because I retired from finance.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.920]   And what am I doing now?
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.280]   Talking about financial stuff.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.000]   So I basically decluttered my life
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.840]   and I can do what I love without having to deal
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.520]   with performance reviews and sexual harassment training
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.440]   or anti-sexual harassment training, obviously.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.680]   So, and all of this corporate stuff
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.640]   that you started to hate about your job.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   So I'm very fortunate, obviously.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.720]   I can't imagine how somebody who is a firefighter
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.240]   and then retires from that and can't do what he loves anymore
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.200]   or a medical doctor, potentially, right?
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.080]   So I, yeah, so, I mean, for me, obviously,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.880]   I picked up something that I can do after retirement
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.800]   that's still fun and intellectually challenging
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.280]   and also solves the issue of social interaction.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.040]   So in my hometown of Camas, Washington,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.160]   just under 30,000 people, we have five fire couples.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.840]   So us plus four more.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.640]   And then some of them, many of them, actually,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.640]   I met through my blog during the local fire meetup,
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.840]   monthly meetup meetings.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.160]   So, yeah, I mean, so you basically cover the intellectual,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.600]   the social corners, physical, right?
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.520]   I mean, I have tons of stuff to do in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.480]   And so I think that was something.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   So I always say that some of this emotional stuff,
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.240]   I can wing that in retirement.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.520]   I just make that up as I go along.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.400]   And so I'm more of the finance geek and math geek.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.720]   So I thought that that's harder to fix if you get it wrong.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.160]   But so, I mean, don't look to me
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.240]   in terms of emotional support in early retirement,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.840]   if you know my blog.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   But yeah, I mean, I definitely, maybe intuitively
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.680]   and naturally, I took care of that myself
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.240]   and through that fortunate circumstance
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.320]   that I can still talk and think about finance.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.160]   - Yeah, I think it's definitely a shift, like Paula said.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.960]   I was at the same company for 21 years.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.120]   So that was my identity.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.000]   Like any conferences I went to,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.440]   it was because the company told me
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.040]   I needed to go to that conference.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.280]   The friends that I had,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.200]   it was a built-in friendship network at work.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.680]   Some of them were extraordinary.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.680]   Some of them weren't extraordinary.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.920]   But I think I ended up working two years
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.520]   beyond reaching my fine number.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.080]   I think when I reflect,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:46.080]   I think a part of it was that I knew I had to make the shift
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.000]   of what am I gonna be doing afterwards?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.920]   What am I interested in?
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.640]   It was a lot of the financial stuff.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.080]   So I start going to conferences that I chose.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.120]   I started doing things with people that I chose.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.000]   And slowly within those two years, it made a difference.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.040]   Now my network wasn't just LexisNexis where I work for.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.880]   It was outside of that.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.620]   And I almost think about the trade-off that I made.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.120]   My new friends were friends that I chose
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.840]   in circles that I wanted to be in,
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.200]   that shared the same things that I shared.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.960]   But it took a couple years for it to really click and say,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.600]   "Okay, I think this is a shift that I wanna make."
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.480]   But for 21 years, that was the identity.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.120]   And my job, my workplace, chose those things for me.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.380]   And now I'm choosing them for myself.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.160]   - You know, I think there's a lot of talk
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.520]   about what happens when you leave your job,
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.160]   and especially if you're someone
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.520]   from the financial independence community and do this early.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.080]   I guess I would argue with the fact
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.100]   that you lose your identity when you leave your work.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.280]   If your work was your identity and your purpose
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.600]   and your meaning, you probably wouldn't leave
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.100]   or you do what Earn did, which is leave maybe the job,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.080]   but continue the work.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.480]   I think what we're really asking is how do I, in general,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.240]   identify our sense of purpose and meaning and identity,
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.840]   and probably we're in jobs
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.500]   that don't actually fulfill those needs.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.960]   So I think a lot of us have a sense of purpose and identity
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.400]   that have been given to us or that we've given ourselves
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.640]   'cause they were convenient.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.980]   And most people who get to the place of fire are like,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.320]   "This isn't fulfilling me anymore."
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.000]   And so it's not how do we not lose that sense
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.880]   when we leave work, it's how do we develop it
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.720]   more authentically in the first place.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.760]   And I think that has to do with a lot of searching
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.400]   into purpose and identity.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.120]   The last talk before this was all about
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.160]   how we find our anchors of purpose
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   and how we define ourselves around them.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   So maybe I'm splitting hairs here,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.520]   but I think if you are finding a loss of purpose
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.280]   and identity truly when you leave your job,
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.000]   then you probably shouldn't be leaving your job
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   or at least not your industry,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.760]   'cause if that's really purpose and identity to you,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760]   why are you leaving?
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.320]   - Great, thank you.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.480]   I should add that we're interested in audience questions.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.920]   So there are notepapers and pens
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.820]   throughout where you're sitting
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.160]   and folks are walking around.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.480]   Just raise your hand and someone will come over
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.440]   and grab that question.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.680]   So how about explaining the pursuit of fire
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.760]   to friends who just can't relate?
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.800]   - I don't.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   Easy.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.200]   Yeah, if people are curious about it
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.780]   and they have questions, they're welcome to ask.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.880]   But if they don't bring it up,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.480]   I'm not gonna bring it up.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.700]   So I just don't talk about it
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.980]   with people who don't show any,
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.760]   who don't proactively initiate the interest in it.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.680]   And the other thing that I've noticed,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.140]   so oftentimes, you know if you're at a cocktail party
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.040]   and there's just that,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.200]   like everybody's opening question is,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.360]   so what do you do, right?
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.880]   And I know a lot of people who have struggled
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.280]   to say like, well, I'm retired,
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.240]   'cause if you say that and you're 40,
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.680]   like there's a lot of questions that come with it.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.240]   And I've also noticed for myself,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.540]   like if I say, oh, I'm a podcaster,
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.720]   then there are, people get really excited,
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.680]   and then there's a bunch of follow-up questions.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.720]   And then we just end up talking about work,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.620]   which like, you know, why do you go to a cocktail party
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.000]   just to sit there and talk about work the whole time?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.780]   That seems like a terrible use of your time off from work.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.320]   So I kind of have fun with it.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.360]   Like sometimes I tell people,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.680]   I'm like, okay, you know those desiccant packs,
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.520]   those silica gel, like Stay Fresh desiccant packs?
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.240]   I am the assistant regional sales manager
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.640]   for a B2B desiccant silica gel pack company.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.400]   And then I have like a little silica pack in my purse
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.440]   that I'll pull out.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.680]   So sometimes I'll just goop around
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.520]   to do something like that.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.600]   And later on, if like, you know, I'll be like,
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   just kidding, I'm a,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.460]   actually I was on Netflix, you know?
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.460]   But like, yeah, sometimes I'll just kind of have fun with it
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.400]   and make it playful,
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.240]   because that's just so much more interesting
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.860]   than rehashing the same tired conversation
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.800]   that you've had about work over and over and over and over.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.440]   - Yeah, so I've been going back and forth
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.040]   to the response to that.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.560]   In the beginning, I was too afraid to say I'm retired,
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.000]   right, you come up with something else,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.600]   and then you say it's retired.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.280]   But after you say you're retired,
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.000]   it kind of shuts down the discussion almost in many cases.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.640]   Other people then do follow up question,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.600]   well, how did you do that?
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.280]   And then you explain.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.560]   And quite amazingly,
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.920]   sometimes you find people who were already intuitive
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.160]   without even knowing about fire,
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.280]   intuitively, they are on board with this already, right?
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.460]   Because I mean, in the U.S. right,
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.480]   we have this fantastic system
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.400]   where if you have the right parameters
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.440]   and the right intuition and discipline,
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.960]   there are lots of options to accumulate wealth, right?
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.320]   And not everybody uses it,
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   but the people who use it can accumulate wealth very quickly
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.760]   and you might actually win some people.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   Because if somebody had told me
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.000]   about the fire community before 2015,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   I would have been one such person.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.840]   And I guess I could have benefited
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.240]   from some additional advice.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.520]   And yeah, so, and in German,
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.240]   there is actually another word for retirees,
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.400]   called Privatier, which is,
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.440]   that also has a very bad connotation.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.000]   It sounds a little bit like stuffy old money,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.200]   which of course, that's not what we are, right?
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.800]   We are mostly self-made people.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.560]   So it's very hard to,
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.160]   if you talk to people who are not in our system,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.560]   and this can go any way, right?
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.120]   I mean, you could intrigue people,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.560]   but then they lose focus and interest very quickly.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.960]   You could bring more people on board
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.620]   or some people say, well, this is not for me.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.080]   And thank you, but no thank you.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.920]   I mean, we've tried to push some people
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.400]   where we see, I mean,
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.000]   you have to get your finances in order
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.680]   and start contributing to your 401k,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.360]   where there's really only so much you can do.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.600]   And as you can lead the horse to the water,
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.000]   but can't make it drink.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.920]   So that thing applies there.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.600]   So yeah, it's difficult.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.040]   I mean, I'm not trying to be too preachy,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.680]   but I will try to at least make an effort
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.360]   to bring people into our world.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.240]   - Yeah, so Paolo was saying,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.000]   you don't really talk about it unless someone asks you.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.400]   I was doing the same thing.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.720]   And then I wrote "Fire for Dummies."
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.960]   So the jig is up.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.040]   (laughs)
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.360]   When I left my job,
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.120]   and even a little bit while I was still working there,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.760]   I did discover my small P purpose,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.400]   which was financial literacy and education.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.360]   I wanna teach everybody,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:39.360]   mainly younger people about basic personal finance stuff.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.520]   I keep up with how many states require personal finance
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.760]   in order to graduate from high school.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.840]   It's 26.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.360]   So I used to say, I teach people about their money.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.480]   And usually people are interested to talk about money.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.440]   So they'll continue asking follow-up questions.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.680]   I like the podcaster idea.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.000]   I've only been doing it for less than a year,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.080]   but I think that's something people love to talk about.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.600]   But yeah, so it gives me a chance
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.280]   to sort of mention what is passionate to me.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.320]   I don't go into it any more than they want to,
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.280]   but typically, like doctors might have this happen
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.480]   where you tell people you're a doctor,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.560]   and they're like, "Well, I got this itch on my back,"
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.640]   or something. (laughs)
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   So they'll say something about their money.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.000]   "Oh, my 401(k) is all screwed up."
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.520]   Or, "Yeah, I've been trying to get my money right.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.720]   "I have a question."
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.040]   So usually that gives them an opportunity.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.640]   It opens up the door for them to ask a question or whatever.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.600]   And I'm on this big mission to try to make money
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.120]   not a taboo topic to talk about.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.560]   So I guess I kind of see it as an opportunity
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.920]   to open a conversation about something
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.420]   I really love talking about.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.760]   So as a young hospice doctor, from time to time,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.240]   I would be asked to go see a patient or a family.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.440]   And I'd walk into the room,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.320]   and we'd start having the death conversation.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.260]   And they had already signed up for hospice,
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.260]   but they clearly didn't want to hear it.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.920]   They were in denial, they're not dying.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.800]   Their family members were in denial, they're not dying.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.480]   And I spent maybe the first six months
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.800]   trying to tell them they were wrong,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.120]   and all it caused was anxiety and stress and unhappiness.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.280]   And so from that, I learned that you meet people
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.840]   where they are, you can't drag them to where you are.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.120]   And I think that goes along with fire, too.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.800]   Even with a spouse, all you can do is meet people
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.660]   where they are and be intentional and clear
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.960]   on who you are and what you believe.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.160]   And when they are ready to hear it,
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.380]   they will come back to you.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.580]   Otherwise, it's hard to drag them kicking and screaming
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.040]   to where you are.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.880]   - Great, thank you.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.460]   I want to pick up on the spouse thread in a minute.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.360]   But since employer-sponsored health insurance
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.560]   is such a big barrier for people taking the leap
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.520]   towards leaving their jobs,
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.400]   can you share some insights into demystifying
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.680]   health insurance outside of employer-sponsored
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   health insurance?
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.080]   - Just don't get it.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.340]   (laughing)
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:59.560]   - So I have been purchasing individual health insurance
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:04.060]   since 2008, so pre-ACA.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:07.380]   I will say, since the ACA started,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.380]   it's more expensive, but it's also easier to get,
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.800]   and it covers more.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.860]   So I think a lot of the questions around how to get it
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.220]   have kind of, like, the logistical, like, what do I do?
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.920]   Well, there's a, like, online marketplace,
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.580]   and you go and you compare plans.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.460]   But in terms of the monetary thing,
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.580]   what I encourage people to do is just think of it,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.220]   you know, I think people often,
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.480]   they see it as this kind of special line item
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.640]   that is somehow different than any other given line item
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.820]   on your budget.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.820]   Like, a discreet 800 or 1,200 or 1,600,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.260]   depending on how many people you're covering,
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:55.100]   a discreet X amount of money per month
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.540]   is no different than X amount of money
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.180]   spent on anything else, and you simply budget for it.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.900]   Like, it always struck me as strange
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.220]   that no one ever came to me and said,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.060]   but how do I budget for my mortgage?
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.680]   You know, 'cause everyone expects to budget
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.820]   for their mortgage.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.480]   No one ever said, how do I budget for groceries?
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.220]   Even though, you know, maybe your grocery bill
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.020]   is kind of, maybe you've got a family of four
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.920]   and your grocery bill is sort of high.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:28.660]   But, like, if people expect to budget a given amount
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.060]   for a given line item,
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.260]   there never tend to be questions about it.
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.060]   But if people aren't used to something,
[00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:38.400]   then it's sort of treated like this unique category.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.300]   So what I would say is, don't think of it as special.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.700]   Just think of it as any other category.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.500]   - Yeah, so we have private health insurance.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.740]   It's a high-deductible plan,
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.280]   and our premium is quite affordable.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.860]   And even if we have to pay the premium
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.160]   plus the maximum annual out-of-pocket spending,
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.060]   I mean, it wouldn't ruin us financially.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.980]   It would be kind of sort of painful.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.820]   I mean, it wouldn't derail our retirement.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.920]   So it's almost that the problem solves itself.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.420]   Either you have such a big budget in early retirement
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.000]   that you can just afford to pay that,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.620]   or you actually hack the Affordable Care Act
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.760]   and you keep your taxable income so low
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.340]   that you get the ACA subsidies
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.060]   and pay relatively little in premium,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.740]   and also your out-of-pocket maximum is very low.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.960]   And I always, it gives me heartache
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.600]   when I read blog posts about this.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.760]   Maybe we shouldn't advertise that too much, right?
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.200]   If some politician or media picked that up
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.280]   and says we are some multimillionaires
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.740]   that keep their taxable income really low
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.200]   and then get the ACA subsidies,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.620]   they were not intended for you, right?
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.080]   They were intended for just ordinary,
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.800]   lower-middle-class families.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   But yeah, I mean, there's some blogs,
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.960]   I think Justin, Root of Good,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.300]   he has really good content on how to hack that
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.020]   and get all sorts of other interesting
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.500]   means-tested benefits.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.100]   I think he gets his cable TV really cheap.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.260]   I mean, he's a multimillionaire,
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.660]   but he's watching free cable television, basically.
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.260]   And so there are ways to hack that.
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.260]   I don't think it's as much of a headache
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.620]   as some people want to make it.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:18.460]   - Yeah, I would agree that the ACA
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.540]   is not as much as a headache as people think,
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.420]   but remember that it is state-specific
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.140]   and to an extent, county-specific.
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.100]   So if you're talking to someone
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.660]   that has a family of five in the state of California,
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.740]   that is very different from a single person like me
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.260]   that lives in the state of Ohio.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.860]   So do your own research.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.020]   You don't even have to sign up for an account,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:41.660]   but it's only income-based, not assets.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.220]   So that's just the rules right now.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.940]   You can call it a hack if you want.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.020]   But I always like to make the point
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.460]   that this whole question or dilemma
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.140]   about health insurance when it's not tied to a job,
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.460]   again, I worked for the same company for 21 years,
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.740]   and I was used to that health insurance through my job.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.420]   But the FHIR community isn't unique
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.540]   in trying to solve that problem.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.380]   You've got self-employed people.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.820]   You've got small business owners.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.700]   You've got solopreneurs.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.960]   All of those people have had to solve this problem
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.220]   for a long time.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.620]   So either talk to them or realize
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.480]   that there are plenty of options.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.280]   Some people I know have chosen to go
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.320]   with a health-share ministry.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.800]   That's not really health insurance,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.200]   but it's an alternative.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.860]   If you're going back to school, that's an option.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.860]   I had a list of seven different things I considered
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.740]   for health insurance once I decoupled from my job.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.060]   So there are a lot of options,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.040]   but every single article I've seen for the last 10 years
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.520]   that talk about somebody that retired early,
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.080]   I still hear the same thing.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.840]   But what do they do about health insurance?
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.400]   So it's just still something that people just can't grasp
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.760]   because in the US, it's so closely tied to our job.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.240]   - Yeah, I don't have a lot to add
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.040]   except to say that for 99.5% of people,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.160]   it's either gonna be the ACA
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:03.840]   or some form of insurance broker with average rates.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.040]   Yes, there are people who try to gamify it
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.760]   with health-sharing ministries,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   farm insurance, expat insurance, going back to school.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.400]   I mean, there's all sorts of little ways
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.000]   you can try to gamify it if you want,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.840]   which generally don't work for most people.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.360]   But there are some way if that really gets you excited,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.600]   go for it, but otherwise,
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.160]   it's gonna be ACA or private insurance broker.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.800]   - Great, thanks for that.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.040]   So picking up on the spousal comment earlier,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.080]   even if not in your own relationships from your fire work,
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.760]   you've gathered a ton of insights from others.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.480]   What would you share for folks
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.520]   who are disconnected with their spouse or partner
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.560]   in terms of the pursuit of fire?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.520]   - Yeah.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:50.960]   I would say that that is a microcosm
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.280]   of being disconnected in your values.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.000]   So the core conversation that you need to have
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.840]   is not about fire,
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.800]   but rather about the alignment of your values
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.480]   and the alignment of the direction
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.360]   that your shared lives are taking.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   And once those come into alignment,
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.200]   then fire can be a part of that,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.920]   may or may not be a part of that.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.300]   But the values and the direction in which you're moving,
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.520]   that's the fundamental underlying conversation.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.400]   - Yeah, so my wife has been on board
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.520]   with this whole fire idea for as long as we know each other.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.920]   So I mean, she was in the loop
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.520]   about what we were planning to do,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.920]   and she was looking forward to that.
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.040]   So I don't think there was any concern.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.240]   After we fired, we sold our condo
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.360]   and we traveled for seven months,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   sometimes in a cruise ship cabin,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.040]   as I think it's 168 square feet.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.160]   It was just three people, my wife, my daughter,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.340]   and I really on constrained spaces.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.280]   And we didn't hate each other afterwards.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.080]   So it was a good sign.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.400]   It's not that I had much doubt about it,
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.560]   but in the back of your mind,
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.540]   it could have been a little bit of doubt there.
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.200]   But yeah, I mean, it's obviously,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.960]   the reason why you're together
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.560]   is you probably have the same values and the same plan.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.080]   So my wife was on board.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.280]   There were some people where,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.160]   I mean, when we announced that we fired,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.960]   so the wife and the husband, right?
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.920]   The wife talked to my wife and the husband talked to me,
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.960]   and they both independently told us
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.060]   that we couldn't do what you do.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.820]   I mean, I want to be at the office for 12 hours a day.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.280]   I mean, I couldn't stand being at home for that long.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.800]   And then the wife said the same thing.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.760]   I'm glad that my husband goes to work 12 hours
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.120]   because I need to do stuff at home
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.200]   and I can't have him in my hair.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.860]   And amazingly, after COVID, they're still married.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.560]   So I think it worked out even for them
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.800]   when they were at home together.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.760]   But yeah, I mean, I think if your wife is on board
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.160]   and on board early on,
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   but of course it could create some friction, right?
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.680]   Where somebody finds out about fire
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.160]   and is really excited about it,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.960]   what if your spouse is not?
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.160]   So that would be a problem.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.280]   I mean, in the case of my wife and me,
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.320]   we have been talking about this kind of stuff
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.760]   from way early, from when we started dating
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.840]   until we got married and through marriage
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.120]   and then in retirement.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.520]   So we were on the same page.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.000]   - Yeah, most of the people that I've talked to
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.080]   that do have a partner or a spouse
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.480]   is really more about talking about
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.520]   what you want your life to look like.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.760]   If you're not going to work every day,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.600]   do you want to see each other every day?
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.480]   And so you both have to kind of get to the place
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.400]   of what you want your life to look like
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.360]   and then the finances kind of come next.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.440]   Because we're emotional creatures,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.560]   how do you feel and things like that.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.880]   And I kind of use the analogy like,
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.480]   so credit scores for spouses.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.240]   If you're going to get a mortgage
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.720]   and one person has a 650 credit score
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.440]   and somebody has an 800,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.400]   guess what your rate is gonna be based on?
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.760]   The lowest credit score.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.240]   So you have to,
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.400]   whatever the other person wants,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.520]   whatever, I guess the lowest barrier to entry,
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.960]   that's gonna be what you have to end up doing.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.720]   You have to somehow agree on that.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.280]   You don't both have to necessarily
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.920]   even retire at the same time,
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.760]   but you both have to come to an agreement
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.480]   and you're only gonna be able to do
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.280]   what the lesser of what the other person wants to do.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.520]   - I mean, I think we have two problems here.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.720]   One is there's a misnomer.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.440]   I mean, someone may want to fire, may not want to fire,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.960]   but everyone wants financial freedom.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.520]   So I think we need to reframe this as
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.080]   everybody wants financial freedom.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.200]   You and your spouse are both gonna want financial freedom.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.400]   So I think it's much safer to stick with that
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.240]   as opposed to fire,
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.160]   which maybe one spouse wants and one spouse doesn't.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.080]   The other issue is information asymmetry.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.400]   So typically I'm a man
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.520]   and this tends to be a man in a relationship,
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.000]   not always, but tends to be,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.520]   is the man and women are going to run a marathon together
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.240]   and the guy starts two hours early
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.360]   and then expects his wife to finish
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.600]   at the same time he does.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.080]   Usually the partner who's really interested in fire
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.880]   has been reading fire blogs,
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.280]   listening to fire podcasts and reading fire books
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.720]   for months, sometimes even years
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.840]   before they've even brought it up to the spouse.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.000]   And then to imagine that all of a sudden
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.240]   you're going to introduce it to them
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.320]   and they're gonna get on board
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.560]   and be caught up to you within weeks or months
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.760]   is just not reasonable.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.040]   And so I think a lot of these people
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.200]   who are finding this information asymmetry
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   and they're finding one really wants to push forward
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.480]   with this plan and the other doesn't
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.800]   is that the person who's ahead
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.360]   needs to stop and slow down
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.800]   and let their spouse catch up with them.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.880]   - Great, thank you.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.720]   So consolidating two different audience questions,
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.440]   post-FI, what is your percentage asset allocation
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.280]   and dollar-wise annual spend
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.320]   to the extent you're comfortable sharing?
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:49.760]   - Well, I mean, so for me, I have not stopped working.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   In fact, I work now more than I worked when I was pre-FI.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.080]   So, but my asset allocation,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.280]   I'd say half of my net worth is in like,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.760]   half of my net worth is in equities,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.400]   the other half is in real estate.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.120]   Within my investable portfolio,
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.040]   I have a barbell allocation, so I'm equities and cash.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.640]   I don't have any bonds.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.720]   And then as far as my equities go,
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   I have a mix of just total stock market and small caps.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.960]   - Sorry, can you elaborate on why no bonds?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:31.920]   - I guess I see the rental property portion of my portfolio
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.200]   as the essentially equivalent
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.480]   to the fixed income portion of my portfolio.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.720]   So rental properties provide me with an income stream,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.360]   which I just reinvest.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   And yeah, and then the equities are the equities.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.200]   And then of course,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.560]   they're counterbalanced by the cash allocation.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.520]   Yeah, we have about a little bit over 10% in real estate.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.480]   And then the financial assets is about 75, 25.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   So 75% stocks, 25% bonds or bond-like, I would call it.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:08.320]   And so I also do a little bit of option trading.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.880]   So, but that's on top of the existing portfolios.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.200]   I don't have to take anything out to do option trading.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.280]   So that's on margin.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.160]   That's about, in a taxable account,
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.560]   that's about 40% of my portfolio.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.000]   And yeah, so spending is,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.320]   so we, our annual needs are somewhere in the six figures,
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.320]   on the low six figures.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.760]   So just a little bit above 100K, I guess.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.080]   And that also includes while paying for taxes.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.240]   And, but so that's covered in that too.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.240]   And yeah, so that's our financials.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.340]   - And actually, annual spend was part of the question.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:50.000]   - I honestly have no idea.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.040]   Like, don't really know.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.400]   I don't keep a budget.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.840]   I'm a fan of what I call the anti-budget,
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.280]   which is just, and this is not for everyone.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.480]   This is just me.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.080]   Just make, set a savings goal.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.960]   Make sure that you are siphoning enough to savings
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.140]   that you're matching your savings goal.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.480]   And then everything else is yours to spend.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.960]   And I just keep a big enough buffer in my checking account
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   that I know that I've got more cash than I need.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.480]   And so I don't really have to think about it
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.760]   or worry about it.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.020]   So I have no idea what I spend.
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.960]   - So for me, well, this is the first time
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   I'm hanging out with Paula.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.080]   We got way more in common than I thought.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.520]   So I hope it's not blasphemy,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.000]   but I don't have any bonds either.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.480]   I believe in fixed income.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.820]   I just don't like bonds being that.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.520]   I think someone might've talked about it earlier,
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.280]   where I'm more likely to do,
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.400]   like right now how you use savings accounts are pretty good.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   I bonds, I have a little bit of that, but no bond funds.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.120]   I lean growth.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:04.120]   So I do Vanguard and I prefer a Vanguard growth index fund
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:08.280]   versus like a total stock market or S&P 500.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.260]   I do have a single stock portfolio.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.360]   I think I always will.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.040]   I just nerd out on researching great companies.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.460]   And that's just something that I enjoy doing.
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.320]   Let's see, that's my allocation.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   Oh, so my spending is very close to what I spent
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.600]   when I was working between like 40 and 45,000.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.500]   I was saving, I had about a 40% savings rate.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.880]   So I just no longer have the savings rate
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.680]   and I've been retired for five years.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.880]   Every year looked different.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.020]   So there were some years where I had to pull off
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.120]   not even 4% really.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.600]   And there was one year where I did have enough income
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.960]   where I didn't have to pull off anything at all.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.840]   But these were passion projects, things I enjoy doing.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   So I'm not quite ready to say I'm under retired
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.680]   because I'm not consistently trying to do the hustle
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.800]   or work anybody's full-time or even part-time job.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.880]   So that's kind of what my post-FI life looks like.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.680]   - You did.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.720]   - All right, so I would say roughly I am 90% equities
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:21.720]   and 10% a mix of bonds, real estate, and cash.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   I plan to continue that even after my wife stops working,
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:28.760]   which is gonna be next year because I'm not really worried
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.840]   about sequence of returns risk
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.280]   'cause I'm always gonna make some money.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.760]   So if I make a third or a fourth of what I used to make
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.200]   doing things I love, I'm gonna cash out those equities
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.960]   and be happy even if the market's down.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.000]   I don't care because my staple draw rate's gonna be
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.600]   probably less than 3, less than 2.5,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.360]   just by the fact that I'm making some money.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.480]   As for how much I spend a year,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.120]   I'm not going to give you a number,
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.520]   but I wanna, you know, what do you think I spend?
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.480]   Take a second and think of that.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.120]   What do you think I spend a year?
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.560]   All right, multiply it by three
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.800]   and it's probably more accurate.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.720]   - Can I tack on one other quick thing that didn't come up,
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.520]   that doesn't come up much is social security.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.200]   I personally did not include it at all
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.400]   in my FIRE number and my FIRE plans,
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.840]   and most FIRE people don't.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.640]   So once I retired and I cleared the cobwebs out of my head,
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.280]   I wanted to do my own research
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.520]   and see the viability of social security,
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.480]   and I learned a lot.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.480]   So even if I decide to take my social security at 62,
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:34.320]   I'm still at $2,500 a month adjusted for inflation
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.600]   for the rest of my life.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.040]   So that is what I consider my backstop
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.880]   if any of this fails.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.120]   So I think that fails to get mentioned sometimes.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   - Excellent.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.640]   So it seems we're at time,
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.480]   but we have two more audience questions
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.320]   that I think you guys will provide profound insights to.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.560]   So I'm gonna squeeze them in.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.160]   I'm gonna ask them both at once,
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.340]   answer them to the extent for each,
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.720]   as you feel we can squeeze in the last few seconds.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.720]   So one, lessons learned from a financial mistake you made,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   and then how to begin the pursuit of FI as a late starter.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.480]   - Okay, I'd say the biggest financial mistake that I made
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:20.200]   was in my 20s, I hyper-focused on frugality.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.720]   And it was because, as you said at the beginning of this,
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.280]   my first job out of college, I made $21,000 a year.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.720]   That was in 2005 dollars.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.480]   So you can adjust it for inflation.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.920]   My most amount of money that I ever made
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:39.560]   working for somebody else was $31,000 a year.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.360]   That was in 2008.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.100]   So adjust that for inflation.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.200]   That's the most I ever made
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.720]   as a W-2 employee for someone else.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.240]   Because of that, I lacked the confidence
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.280]   to believe that I could make money.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.920]   And so I was obsessed with just penny,
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.680]   like ridiculous penny pinching.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.760]   I was completely focused on the,
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.480]   like live on as little as possible side of the equation.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.200]   Because I lacked the confidence to understand
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.600]   that I could make more, particularly given that
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:12.240]   I just had no aptitude for STEM.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.280]   And I was like, well, if I'm not in a STEM profession,
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.400]   then how can I ever make money?
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.280]   And so that kind of negative self-talk
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.880]   and those limiting beliefs and those limiting ideas,
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.040]   that was my 20s.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.440]   And that was probably the compounding effect
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.500]   of not focusing on making more,
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:35.520]   has compounding reverberations for the rest of my life.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.080]   What was the second question?
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.240]   - Starting FI as a late starter.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.600]   - Starting FI as a late starter.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.240]   I would, first,
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.660]   I wouldn't think of yourself as a late starter.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:53.120]   My dad did not open his first retirement account
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.560]   until he was 50, five zero, 50.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.120]   He came to the United States in his late 30s.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.920]   He got his, he went into a PhD program.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   He got his first job at 41, making U.S. dollars.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.960]   Opened his first retirement account at 50.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.640]   He's now 83 years old.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.560]   You know, like he had a good 25 years
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:25.080]   to like buy a home and buy his first car and raise me.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.340]   And save for retirement.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:32.040]   So even if you're 50 or 55,
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:35.480]   don't think of yourself as late.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.840]   That's a limiting idea because life is long.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.120]   Like if you're planning on living to 100,
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:47.000]   you know, you're like 50%, 55% of the way through.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   You know, you've got a lot of time left.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.760]   - Let me answer the second one first.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.000]   So the biggest objection to even getting started
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.640]   to investing is that people always say,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.240]   well, the market is really expensive right now.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.080]   So why do I even start now?
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.600]   And my personal experience has been,
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.520]   I started investing, first job out of grad school,
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.880]   started working in Atlanta in 2000,
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.980]   right at the peak of the dot-com crisis.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.920]   I increased my salary going to the private sector in 2008.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.080]   Again, right around the market peak.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:23.280]   And then each time I either started investing
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.080]   or I increased my investing,
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.120]   it was right around the time, the market peak,
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.440]   and you had the horrible recession
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.280]   and bear market around the corner.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.640]   And people ask me, isn't that particularly bad timing?
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.520]   I said, no, it's great timing
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.440]   'cause you get the dollar cost averaging through the trough.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.280]   So I always tell people,
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.480]   I mean, don't try to time when you start.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.360]   I mean, the time to invest was yesterday
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.940]   or last year or 10 years ago.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.320]   So you might as well do it right now.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.280]   Don't try to time that.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.880]   When you start is a lot less important for savers
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.720]   than for retirees.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.680]   Because I'm gonna be on another panel
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.680]   and there I'm gonna preach.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.840]   We have to be careful if you retire at the market peak.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.300]   That makes it more dangerous
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.080]   in terms of sequence of return risk.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.120]   Sequence of return risk,
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.320]   the flip side of that is dollar cost averaging for savers.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.640]   So if you start saving,
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.620]   don't worry about when you start saving.
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.920]   If the market is up, write the momentum.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.160]   If the market is down,
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.960]   well, then you do the J.L. Collins thing.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.720]   Oh, the market is down, you can buy stocks at a discount.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.600]   Either way is a good time to invest and to start investing.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.680]   And don't get discouraged by that.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.480]   It's the bigger mistake to not start investing
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.280]   than to start investing at the wrong time.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.520]   And yeah, I mean, a mistake.
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.840]   I mean, obviously I had some youthful sins,
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.240]   spending and wasting money on durable goods
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.560]   that obviously are not that durable.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.640]   They just depreciate.
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.520]   And so when I was young,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.640]   but by the way, at that time,
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.200]   I thought I had a high savings rate.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.640]   I thought I wore 20 to 25% is much higher
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.440]   than the U.S. average.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.960]   But then maybe if I had found the FIRE community
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:58.800]   a little bit earlier,
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.280]   I would have done that a little bit better.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.040]   But anyways, I still retired at a pretty young age.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.300]   Either way.
[00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.140]   - Thanks.
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.560]   And Jackie and Jordan, speed round.
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.400]   - Yeah, speed round.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.220]   Okay, so my biggest mistake was probably,
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.920]   I didn't have enough in a brokerage account.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.720]   I should have, I had like a 10 or 15 year bridge.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.120]   So I wish I would have had that.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.920]   So I wouldn't be touching any of my Roth
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   that you want to grow much longer.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.520]   And as far as getting a late start,
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.020]   I think it's really a state of mind.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.220]   And that's the main thing.
[00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.120]   People are hard on themselves.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.400]   You know, they wanna beat themselves up.
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   And there's plenty of reasons why the every average American
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.800]   or the average person is a late starter.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.640]   So it's just sort of forgiving yourself,
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.960]   acknowledging why you might've got a late start
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.640]   and just start.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.800]   - I think the topic for a podcast.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:46.640]   - Yeah.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.800]   - Biggest mistake I made was I outsourced my finances
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.720]   to a financial advisor because I was too busy being a doctor.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.440]   And I think everyone should understand their finances,
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.040]   whether they have an advisor or not.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.080]   And that was something that I really paid for in the end.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.920]   And I'm so glad I do it now.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.120]   As for people who think they're starting late,
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.720]   I think the easiest, most straightforward thing to do
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.740]   is there is a podcast by Jackie Kosky and Bill Young
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.260]   called Catching Up to Fi.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.520]   And I think if you go there, you will learn a lot of stuff.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.320]   - Fantastic.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.160]   Thank you.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:18.980]   Let's have a hand for this panel.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:25.160]   (audience cheering)
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:35.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
