[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   - Hello Lex, I'm wondering if you recall
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.880]   what was the initial spark or inspiration
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.840]   that drove you towards work in AI?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.160]   Was it when you were pretty young
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.960]   or was it in more recent years?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.480]   - So I wanted to become a psychiatrist.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.440]   I wanted to, I thought of it as kind of engineering
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.200]   the human mind by sort of manipulating it.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.800]   I thought that's what I thought of psychiatry
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.800]   is by using words to sort of explore the depths of the mind
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.680]   and be able to adjust it.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.960]   But then I realized that psychiatry can't actually do that.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080]   And modern psychiatry is more about
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.680]   sort of bioengineering is drugs.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.720]   And so sort of, I thought that the way to really
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   explore the engineering of the mind
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   is the other side is to build it.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.160]   And that's also when C++ really became the cool hot thing.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.440]   So I learned to program at 12 and then never look back
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.520]   hundreds of thousands of lines later.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.560]   Just, I love program.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.400]   I love building.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.480]   And that's to me is the best way
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.400]   to understand the mind is to build it.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
