[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while

[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.440]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   I'm your host.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.000]   Today I want to share with you what I expect to be the final commentary on the current
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600]   violence happening in Russia and Ukraine.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.460]   Of course, if things change, I'll open up more, but I've done a couple of shows recently
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.920]   on it because of course it's in the news.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.360]   You like me have almost certainly been watching the developments, trying to understand what's
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.940]   been happening, where do we go from here, and I think that this is one of those particular
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.180]   situations that deserves our attention.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.600]   As I shared with you last week with my show on sobering potential, I think this has the
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.720]   potential to touch all of us in many, many ways.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.320]   It's a fluid situation and we don't know exactly where things will wind up.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.480]   What I gave was kind of as best I see as the worst case scenario of things that could happen
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.400]   with increasing levels of violence, but I think it's not particularly likely, at least
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.680]   for most of my audience.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   Most of my audience is not located near Russia or Ukraine.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.560]   Most of my audience is in the West.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.480]   I think it's unlikely that there will be direct involvement for most of us.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.080]   I continue to watch very closely the topic of sanctions, some of the workings in the
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   financial space.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.440]   I watch what Russia is doing in response to the sanctions because I think they're important
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   lessons for the rest of us in terms of currency controls, bank collapses, central bank currencies,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.200]   central banks being frozen off, et cetera.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.520]   It's valuable to learn those lessons and study those particular scenarios.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.880]   What I thought over the last few days, I have been doing quite a lot of reading, trying
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.240]   to understand a little bit more of the situation.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.120]   I want to bring to you some things that I think will be helpful for you to also understand
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.200]   the situation, not written by me, but I was trying to figure out where do you go right
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.320]   now to understand?
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   Where do you go if you're trying to understand what is happening?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.160]   You're in an intensely charged moment, very, very politically charged, which makes it difficult
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.800]   to do public conversation on these topics.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.680]   It makes it difficult to try to figure out what source is right because in the current
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.400]   swing of things, it's hard to know what's propaganda, what's truth, which analysts to
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.480]   look to, which analysts to trust, et cetera.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.040]   This week, I went back to a book that I first read about a decade ago.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   The book is called The Next 100 Years by author George Friedman.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.840]   This book came out in 2010, January of 2010.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.080]   The author wanted to share what he thought would be a forecast literally for the 21st
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   century.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   I read the book soon after it came out.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I don't remember specifically, 2011 perhaps, but I remember reading it soon after it came
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.640]   out and I was very impressed with the book at the time.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.520]   I've since gone on and over the last couple of years, I've read a couple more of his books.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.480]   Last year, I read his book called The Storm Before the Calm, in which author George Friedman
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.800]   predicted why the decade of the 2020s was destined to be a decade of intense conflict
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.040]   in the United States and yet why it's not any kind of permanent conflict or any kind
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.800]   of permanent decline in his forecast.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.120]   It's the storm before the calm.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.400]   I found that book very useful and interesting to me personally in my seeking to understand
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.920]   what's coming in the next decade.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.200]   I additionally read his book called Flashpoints.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040]   I think the subtitle is something like the emerging crisis in Europe or the fault lines
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   in Europe.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.000]   I found that book extremely interesting as well to help to understand more of the European
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.400]   context of some of the rifts that exist across Europe.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   But I hadn't read or thought of this book much since I read it first soon after it came
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.800]   out.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.960]   What I do know that I gained from this book more than 10 years ago is insight into some
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.480]   topics that you've heard me talk about on the show.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.560]   The most important thing I gained at the time was an awareness of the demographic collapse
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.200]   happening in many parts of the world and how that change of demographics was going to be
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.920]   a major shaping force on the 21st century.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.200]   But I wondered to myself, what did he say about the conflict in Russia?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.400]   What did he say about what Russia would do?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.200]   So I went back to this book and I reread it in the last few days and I found it just really,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.520]   really powerful because in it he sketches out what his predictions would be.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.400]   And as part of his predictions, he gives a bit of history.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.800]   First he predicts a conflict involving Russia in the year 2020 and he specifically shows
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.080]   why he thinks Russia 2020 will be engaged in active armed conflict.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.280]   Now he was clearly a couple years wrong.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.480]   It's rather interesting to think of why he might have been wrong.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.360]   But he was a couple years off, it's 2022, but I would say not so bad for a guy writing
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.840]   a book in 2010 and before to be able to forecast the events in Russia.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.360]   But the most important thing I want to give you is the historical and geographical context
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.640]   and some insight into the Russian mine.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   And perhaps that will help you to filter a little bit more accurately what you hear happening
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.160]   as the conflict unholds.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.780]   I want to share with you some extensive excerpts from the book, but I want to begin by reading
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.320]   to you some excerpts from the introduction because I think these excerpts from the introduction
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.700]   will pull you in and will help you to understand even the concept of what geopolitical forecasting
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.840]   is.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.920]   And then we'll go specifically to a couple of excerpts discussing Russia.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.960]   And I feel my hope is that this will help you, especially when you know that somebody
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:03.640]   is writing this in 2010, 12 years before the violent war that we see in front of us right
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   now.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:15.400]   And hopefully that will help to assuage some of the current political hotness of it, just
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.200]   to understand the context.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.400]   So we begin with some excerpts from the introduction.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.760]   An Introduction to the American Age.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.260]   Imagine that you were alive in the summer of 1900, living in London, then the capital
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.040]   of the world.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.720]   Europe ruled the Eastern Hemisphere.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.020]   There was hardly a place that, if not ruled directly, was not indirectly controlled from
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.240]   a European capital.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.480]   Europe was at peace and enjoying unprecedented prosperity.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.400]   Indeed, European interdependence due to trade and investment was so great that serious people
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.380]   were claiming that war had become impossible.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.640]   And if not impossible, would end within weeks of beginning, because global financial markets
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.200]   couldn't withstand the strain.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.280]   The future seemed fixed.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.560]   A peaceful, prosperous Europe would rule the world.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.080]   Imagine yourself now in the summer of 1920.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   Europe had been torn apart by an agonizing war.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.600]   The continent was in tatters.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:25.680]   The Austro-Hungarian, Russian, German, and Ottoman empires were gone, and millions had
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.880]   died in a war that lasted for years.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.720]   The war ended when an American army of a million men intervened, an army that came and then
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.280]   just as quickly left.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.640]   Communism dominated Russia, but it was not clear that it could survive.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.760]   Countries that had been on the periphery of European power, like the United States and
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.480]   Japan, suddenly emerged as great powers.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.600]   But one thing was certain.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.920]   The peace treaty that had been imposed on Germany guaranteed that it would not soon
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.440]   re-emerge.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.560]   Imagine the summer of 1940.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.680]   Germany had not only re-emerged, but conquered France and dominated Europe.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   Communism had survived, and the Soviet Union now was allied with Nazi Germany.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   Great Britain alone stood against Germany, and from the point of view of most reasonable
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.360]   people the war was over.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.260]   If there was not to be a thousand-year Reich, then certainly Europe's fate had been decided
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.320]   for a century.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.380]   Germany would dominate Europe and inherit its empire.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.400]   Imagine now the summer of 1960.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   Germany had been crushed in the war.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.240]   Defeated less than five years later, Europe was occupied, split down the middle by the
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.700]   United States and the Soviet Union.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.700]   The European empires were collapsing, and the United States and Soviet Union were competing
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.960]   over who would be their heir.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.840]   The United States had the Soviet Union surrounded, and, with an overwhelming arsenal of nuclear
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.760]   weapons, could annihilate it in hours.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.020]   The United States had emerged as the global superpower.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.360]   It dominated all of the world's oceans, and, with its nuclear force, could dictate
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.120]   terms to anyone in the world.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.800]   Sailmate was the best the Soviets could hope for.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.000]   Unless the Soviets invaded Germany and conquered Europe.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   That was the war everyone was preparing for.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.560]   And in the back of everyone's mind, the Maoist Chinese, seen as fanatical, were the
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.300]   other danger.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.040]   Now imagine the summer of 1980.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:37.720]   The United States had been defeated in a seven-year war, not by the Soviet Union, but by communist
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.640]   North Vietnam.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:46.760]   The nation was seen, and saw itself, as being in retreat.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   Expelled from Vietnam, it was then expelled from Iran as well, where the oil fields, which
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.840]   it no longer controlled, seemed about to fall into the hands of the Soviet Union.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.240]   To contain the Soviet Union, the United States had formed an alliance with Maoist China,
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.400]   the American president and the Chinese chairman holding an amiable meeting in Beijing.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.240]   Only this alliance seemed able to contain the powerful Soviet Union, which appeared
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.800]   to be surging.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.840]   Imagine now the summer of 2000.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.080]   The Soviet Union had completely collapsed.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:27.840]   China was still communist in name, but had become capitalist in practice.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.640]   NATO had advanced into Eastern Europe and even into the former Soviet Union.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.260]   The world was prosperous and peaceful.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:42.080]   Everyone knew that geopolitical considerations had become secondary to economic considerations,
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.680]   and the only problems were regional ones, in basket cases like Haiti or Kosovo.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.120]   Then came September 11, 2001, and the world turned on its head again.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.360]   At a certain level, when it comes to the future, the only thing one can be sure of is that
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.900]   common sense will be wrong.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:07.560]   There is no magic 20-year cycle, there is no simplistic force governing this pattern.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.680]   It is simply that the things that appear to be so permanent and dominant at any given
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.800]   moment in history can change with stunning rapidity.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.080]   Eras come and go.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.160]   In international relations, the way the world looks right now is not at all how it will
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.160]   look in 20 years, or even less.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.440]   The fall of the Soviet Union was hard to imagine, and that is exactly the point.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   Conventional political analysis suffers from a profound failure of imagination.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:45.520]   It imagines passing clouds to be permanent, and is blind to powerful long-term shifts
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.640]   taking place in full view of the world.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.220]   If we were at the beginning of the 20th century, it would be impossible to forecast the particular
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.400]   events I've just listed.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.680]   But there are some things that could have been, and in fact were, forecast.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.440]   For example, it was obvious that Germany, having united in 1871, was a major power in
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   an insecure position, trapped between Russia and France, and wanted to redefine the European
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.920]   and global systems.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.720]   Most of the conflicts in the first half of the 20th century were about Germany's status
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   in Europe.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:29.760]   While the times and places of wars couldn't be forecast, the probability that there would
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:35.640]   be a war could be and was forecast by many Europeans.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   The harder part of this equation would be forecasting that the wars would be so devastating,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.160]   and that after the First and Second World Wars were over, Europe would lose its empire.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.000]   But there were those, particularly after the invention of dynamite, who predicted that
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.820]   war would now be catastrophic.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.600]   If the forecasting on technology had been combined with the forecasting on geopolitics,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.320]   the shattering of Europe might well have been predicted.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.600]   Certainly the rise of the United States and Russia was predicted in the 19th century.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.520]   Both Alexis de Tocqueville and Friedrich Nietzsche forecast the preeminence of these
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.140]   two countries.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.300]   So standing at the beginning of the 20th century, it would have been possible to forecast its
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.280]   general outlines with discipline and some luck.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.200]   Standing at the beginning of the 21st century, we need to identify the single pivotal event
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   for this century, the equivalent of German unification for the 20th century.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.240]   After the debris of the European empire has cleared away, as well as what's left of
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:44.200]   the Soviet Union, one power remains standing and overwhelmingly powerful.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.480]   That power is the United States.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   Certainly, as is usually the case, the United States currently appears to be making a mess
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.040]   of things around the world, but it's important not to be confused by the passing chaos.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.680]   The United States is economically, militarily, and politically the most powerful country
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.500]   in the world, and there is no real challenger to that power.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.280]   Like the Spanish-American war, a hundred years from now, the war between the United States
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.720]   and the radical Islamists will be little remembered, regardless of the prevailing sentiment of
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.440]   this time.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.040]   Ever since the civil war, the United States has been on an extraordinary economic surge.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   It has turned from a marginal developing nation into an economy bigger than the next four
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.360]   countries combined.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.800]   Militarily, it has gone from being an insignificant force to dominating the globe.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:42.120]   Politically, the United States touches virtually everything, sometimes intentionally and sometimes
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.420]   simply because of its presence.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.040]   As you read this book, it will seem that it is American-centric, written from an American
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   point of view.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.720]   That may be true, but the argument I'm making is that the world does, in fact, pivot around
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.440]   the United States.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.320]   This is not only due to American power.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.960]   It also has to do with a fundamental shift in the way the world works.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.980]   For the past 500 years, Europe was the center of the international system, its empires creating
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.960]   a single global system for the first time in human history.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.200]   The main highway to Europe was the North Atlantic.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   Whoever controlled the North Atlantic controlled access to Europe, and Europe's access to
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.760]   the world.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.080]   The basic geography of global politics was locked into place.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.240]   Then, in the early 1980s, something remarkable happened.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.800]   For the first time in history, Trans-Pacific trade equaled Trans-Atlantic trade.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.500]   With Europe reduced to a collection of secondary powers after World War II, and the shift in
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.680]   trade patterns, the North Atlantic was no longer the single key to anything.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.880]   Now whatever country controlled both the North Atlantic and the Pacific could control, if
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.480]   it wished, the world's trading system, and therefore the global economy.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.840]   In the 21st century, any nation located on both oceans has a tremendous advantage.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:08.160]   Given the cost of building naval power, and the huge cost of deploying it around the world,
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.800]   the power native to both oceans became the preeminent actor in the international system,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.020]   for the same reason that Britain dominated the 19th century.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.960]   It lived on the sea it had to control.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   In this way, North America has replaced Europe as the center of gravity in the world, and
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.640]   whoever dominates North America is virtually assured of being the dominant global power.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.080]   For the 21st century at least, that will be the United States.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.880]   The inherent power of the United States coupled with its geographic position makes the United
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.080]   States the pivotal actor of the 21st century.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.280]   That certainly doesn't make it loved.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.160]   On the contrary, its power makes it feared.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.720]   The history of the 21st century, therefore, particularly the first half, will revolve
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.980]   around two opposing struggles.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:03.420]   One will be secondary powers forming coalitions to try to contain and control the United States.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.300]   The second will be the United States acting preemptively to prevent an effective coalition
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.940]   from forming.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.640]   If we view the beginning of the 21st century as the dawn of the American age, superseding
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.080]   the European age, we see that it began with a group of Muslims seeking to recreate the
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.760]   Caliphate, the great Islamic empire that once ran from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.120]   Inevitably they had to strike at the United States in an attempt to draw the world's
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.360]   primary power into war, trying to demonstrate its weakness in order to trigger an Islamic
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.760]   uprising.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.100]   The United States responded by invading the Islamic world.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.680]   But its goal wasn't victory.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.220]   It wasn't even clear what victory would mean.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.280]   Its goal was simply to disrupt the Islamic world and set it against itself, so that an
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.160]   Islamic empire could not emerge.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.120]   The United States doesn't need to win wars.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.640]   It needs to simply disrupt things, so the other side can't build up sufficient strength
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.300]   to challenge it.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.820]   On one level, the 21st century will see a series of confrontations involving lesser
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.820]   powers trying to build coalitions to control American behavior and the United States mounting
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.700]   military operations to disrupt them.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.620]   The 21st century will see even more war than the 20th century, but the wars will be much
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:22.020]   less catastrophic because of both technological changes and the nature of the geopolitical
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.020]   challenge.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.000]   By the way, I want to pause there for a moment.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.500]   One thing that I have said many times is that, as I observe some of the decline in the United
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.600]   States, and it's interesting, all of chapter one, which I will not be reading for you or
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.320]   even talking about, talks about the United States.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:47.080]   And it's very interesting how consistent that sense of declinism is across the American
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.900]   public from all walks of political life, etc.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.740]   But one of the things that I have observed, as I've said frequently to military personnel
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:00.020]   and others, that the United States hasn't won a war since World War II.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.260]   I've decided to stop saying that because after rereading this book this last week,
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.960]   I was impressed with how the author makes the point again and again that the United
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.300]   States doesn't really need or even want to win wars.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.520]   That disruption is the primary objection.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.780]   Disruption in the least costly sense.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.940]   And so if you go back and you look at the last, certainly the last decade, but you look
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.600]   at the last couple decades in that light, that's what you see.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.220]   And I think that's what you see right now, what you're likely to see in the coming
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.820]   years when thinking about even the response to, sorry, I meant coming weeks and months,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.260]   thinking about the response to Russia, at least from the US-American perspective.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.580]   That the United States doesn't really need or want to win wars.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:52.600]   But what is in its goal, its primary objective is simply to cause disruption, to keep a major
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.480]   power from coming against it, and then to protect its homeland.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.380]   So if you're interested in that, definitely get the book.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.180]   My hope is that with this preview, this taste of the book, you will be motivated to get
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.900]   it and read it if you're interested in these kinds of issues.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.860]   If we view the beginning of the 21st century as the dawn of the American, oops, excuse
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.860]   me.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.860]   The United States doesn't need to win wars.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.660]   It simply needs to, it needs to simply disrupt things so the other side can't build up
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.860]   sufficient strength to challenge it.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.780]   On one level, the 21st century will see a series of confrontations involving lesser
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.800]   powers trying to build coalitions to control American behavior, and the United States mounting
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.540]   military operations to disrupt them.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.660]   The 21st century will see even more war than the 20th century, but the wars will be much
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.380]   less catastrophic because of both technical changes and the nature of the geopolitical
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.380]   challenge.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.500]   As we've seen, the changes that lead to the next era are always shockingly unexpected,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.980]   and the first 20 years of this new century will be no exception.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:59.740]   The US-Islamist war is already ending, and the next conflict is in sight.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:06.340]   Russia is recreating its old sphere of influence, and that sphere of influence will inevitably
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.500]   challenge the United States.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.020]   The Russians will be moving westward on the great northern European plain.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.820]   As Russia reconstructs its power, it will encounter the US-dominated NATO in the three
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:24.540]   Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – as well as in Poland.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.420]   There will be other points of friction in the early 21st century, but this new Cold
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.180]   War will supply the flashpoints after the US-Islamist war dies down.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.740]   The Russians can't avoid trying to reassert power, and the United States can't avoid
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.700]   trying to resist.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.260]   But in the end, Russia can't win.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:50.380]   Its deep internal problems, massively declining population, and poor infrastructure ultimately
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.340]   make Russia's long-term survival prospects bleak, and the second Cold War – less frightening
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.700]   and much less global than the first – will end, as the first did, with the collapse of
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.900]   Russia.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.300]   There are many who predict that China is the next challenger to the United States, not
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   Russia.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.460]   I don't agree with that view for three reasons.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:14.460]   First, when you look at a map of China closely, you see that it is really a very isolated
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.960]   country physically.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.100]   With Siberia in the north, the Himalayas and jungles to the south, and most of China's
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.620]   population in the eastern part of the country, the Chinese aren't going to easily expand.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.940]   Second, China has not been a major naval power for centuries, and building a navy requires
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:36.660]   a long time not only to build ships, but to create well-trained and experienced sailors.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.340]   Third, there is a deeper reason for not worrying about China.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.460]   China is inherently unstable.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.080]   Whenever it opens its borders to the outside world, the coastal region becomes prosperous,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.220]   but the vast majority of Chinese in the interior remain impoverished.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.500]   This leads to tension, conflict, and instability.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.700]   It also leads to economic decisions made for political reasons, resulting in inefficiency
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.700]   and corruption.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.380]   This is not the first time that China has opened itself to foreign trade, and it will
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.760]   not be the last time that it becomes unstable as a result.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.060]   Nor will it be the last time that a figure like Mao emerges to close the country off
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:22.120]   from the outside, equalize the wealth or poverty, and begin the cycle anew.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:26.820]   There are some who believe that the trends of the last 30 years will continue indefinitely.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:32.540]   I believe the Chinese cycle will move to its next and inevitable phase in the coming decade.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.220]   Far from being a challenger, China as a country, the United States will be trying to bolster
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.820]   and hold together as a counterweight to the Russians.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.620]   Current Chinese economic dynamism does not translate into long-term success.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.460]   I want to interrupt my reading here and give some commentary.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.500]   One of the articles that was so interesting over the last week was how the United States
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:01.780]   was feeding classified intelligence to the Chinese regarding Russian movements, and basically
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.220]   doing exactly what this author predicted, what Friedman predicted, that the United States
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.420]   has been trying to use China against Russia.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:15.660]   Now Russia is trying to create an alliance with China, and trying to use China and strengthen
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.340]   its relationship there as a counterweight to the United States.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.020]   So we see this playing out, but I think it's very interesting to see that prediction from
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:28.940]   a decade ago coming true even with the news articles from the last few days.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.100]   In the middle of the century, other powers will emerge, countries that aren't thought
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.620]   of as great powers today, but that I expect will become more powerful and assertive over
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.500]   the next few decades.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.420]   Three stand out in particular.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.140]   The first is Japan.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.340]   It's the second largest economy in the world and the most vulnerable, being highly dependent
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:51.060]   on the importation of raw materials, since it has almost none of its own.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.220]   With a history of militarism, Japan will not remain the marginal, pacifistic power it has
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.220]   been.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.540]   It cannot.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:04.060]   Its own deep population problems and abhorrence of large-scale immigration will force it to
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.820]   look for new workers in other countries.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.740]   Japan's vulnerabilities, which I've written about in the past and which the Japanese have
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.420]   managed better than I've expected up until this point, in the end will force a shift
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.260]   in policy.
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.540]   Then there is Turkey, currently the 17th largest economy in the world.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.540]   Historically, when a major Islamic empire has emerged, it has been dominated by the
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.700]   Turks.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.260]   The Ottomans collapsed at the end of World War I, leaving modern Turkey in its wake.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.380]   But Turkey is a stable platform in the midst of chaos.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:38.140]   The Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Arab world to the south are all unstable.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.420]   As Turkey's power grows, and its economy and military are already the most powerful
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.500]   in the region, so will Turkish influence.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.020]   Finally there is Poland.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.020]   Poland hasn't been a great power since the 16th century, but it once was, and I think
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.460]   will be again.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.500]   Two factors make this possible.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.300]   First will be the decline of Germany.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.820]   Its economy is large and still growing, but it has lost the dynamism it has had for two
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.020]   centuries.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.240]   In addition, its population is going to fall dramatically in the next 50 years, further
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.500]   undermining its economic power.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.380]   Second, as the Russians press on the Poles from the east, the Germans won't have an
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.220]   appetite for a third war with Russia.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:23.740]   The United States, however, will back Poland, providing it with massive economic and technical
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.980]   support.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.620]   Wars, when your country isn't destroyed, stimulate economic growth, and Poland will
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.820]   become the leading power in a coalition of states facing the Russians.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:40.580]   Japan, Turkey, and Poland will each be facing a United States even more confident than it
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.820]   was after the second fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.820]   That will be an explosive situation.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.540]   As we will see during the course of this book, the relationships among these four countries
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:56.780]   will greatly affect the 21st century, leading ultimately to the next global war.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.020]   This war will be fought differently from any in history, with weapons that are today in
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.940]   the realm of science fiction.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.080]   But as I will try to outline, this mid-21st century conflict will grow out of the dynamic
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.740]   forces born in the early part of the new century.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   Gozan talks significantly about technical advances, some predictions about some of the
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.660]   technical advances.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:22.340]   Some of the most interesting comments that he leads goes on to talk about immigration,
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.900]   demographics, the impact of a shrinking world population.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:32.780]   He talks about future conflict between Mexico and the United States, which I find very,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:39.740]   very interesting and important with the history of Mexico and the United States.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.380]   I wanted to take a moment though and read a section on geopolitics, because this will
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:50.420]   explain the conversations coming regarding Russia.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:55.580]   One point I've already made is that reasonable people are incapable of anticipating the future.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:00.420]   The old New Left slogan, "Be practical, demand the impossible," needs to be changed.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.320]   Be practical, expect the impossible.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.140]   This idea is at the heart of my method.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.780]   From another more substantial perspective, this is called geopolitics.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.820]   Geopolitics is not simply a pretentious way of saying international relations.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.540]   It is a method for thinking about the world and forecasting what will happen down the
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.260]   road.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.220]   Economists talk about an invisible hand in which the self-interested short-term activities
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.580]   of people lead to what Adam Smith called the wealth of nations.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.500]   Geopolitics applies the concept of the invisible hand to the behavior of nations and other
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.580]   international actors.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.620]   The pursuit of short-term self-interest by nations and by their leaders leads, if not
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:47.940]   to the wealth of nations, then at least to predictable behavior and therefore the ability
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.100]   to forecast the shape of the future international system.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.740]   Geopolitics and economics both assume that the players are rational, at least in the
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.420]   sense of knowing their own short-term self-interest.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:04.140]   As rational actors, reality provides them with limited choices.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.540]   It is assumed that, on the whole, people and nations will pursue their self-interest, if
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.160]   not flawlessly, then at least not randomly.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.780]   Think of a chess game.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.500]   On the surface, it appears that each player has 20 potential opening moves.
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.980]   In fact, there are many fewer, because most of these moves are so bad that they quickly
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.840]   lead to a defeat.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.260]   The better you are at chess, the more clearly you see your options and the fewer moves there
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.700]   actually are available.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.080]   The better the player, the more predictable the moves.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:44.700]   The grandmaster plays with absolute, predictable precision until that one brilliant, unexpected
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.540]   stroke.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.540]   Nations behave the same way.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:54.100]   The millions or hundreds of millions of people who make up a nation are constrained by reality.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.820]   They generate leaders who would not become leaders if they were irrational.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:04.020]   Climbing to the top of millions of people is not something fools often do.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.780]   Leaders understand their menu of next moves and execute them, if not flawlessly, then
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.620]   at least pretty well.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.020]   An occasional master will come along with a stunningly unexpected and successful move,
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:22.580]   but for the most part, the act of governance is simply executing the necessary and logical
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.460]   next step.
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.840]   When politicians run a country's foreign policy, they operate the same way.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.780]   If a leader dies and is replaced, another emerges, and more likely than not continues
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.060]   what the first one was doing.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.780]   I am not arguing that political leaders are geniuses, scholars, or even gentlemen and
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   ladies.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.340]   Simply, political leaders know how to be leaders, or they wouldn't have emerged as such.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.060]   It is the delight of all societies to belittle their political leaders, and leaders surely
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.780]   do make mistakes.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.280]   But the mistakes they make, when carefully examined, are rarely stupid.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.060]   More likely, mistakes are forced on them by circumstance.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:09.620]   We would all like to believe that we, or our favorite candidate, would never have acted
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.500]   so stupidly.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.980]   It is rarely true.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.380]   Geopolitics, therefore, does not take the individual leader very seriously, any more
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.540]   than economics takes the individual businessman too seriously.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.580]   Both are players who know how to manage a process, but are not free to break the very
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.700]   rigid rules of their professions.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.900]   Politicians are therefore rarely free actors.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:38.420]   Their actions are determined by circumstances and public policy as a response to reality.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.520]   Within narrow margins, political decisions can matter, but the most brilliant leader
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:48.420]   of Iceland will never turn it into a world power, while the stupidest leader of Rome
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.580]   at its height could not undermine Rome's fundamental power.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.860]   Geopolitics is not about the right and wrong of things, it is not about the virtues or
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.780]   vices of politicians, and it is not about foreign policy debates.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.660]   Geopolitics is about broad impersonal forces that constrain nations and human beings and
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.420]   compel them to act in certain ways.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:17.560]   The key to understanding economics is accepting that there are always unintended consequences.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:24.080]   Actions people take for their own good reasons have results they don't envision or intend.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.100]   The same is true with geopolitics.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:31.540]   It is doubtful that the village of Rome, when it started its expansion in the 7th century
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:38.020]   BC, had a master plan for conquering the Mediterranean world 500 years later.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:43.580]   But the first action its inhabitants took against neighboring villages set in motion
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:50.460]   a process that was both constrained by reality and filled with unintended consequences.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.440]   Rome wasn't planned, and neither did it just happen.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.400]   Geopolitical forecasting, therefore, doesn't assume that everything is predetermined.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.100]   It does mean that what people think they are doing, what they hope to achieve, and what
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.480]   the final outcome is are not the same things.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.180]   Nations and politicians pursue their immediate ends, as constrained by reality as a grandmaster
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.720]   is constrained by the chessboard, the pieces, and the rules.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.560]   Sometimes they increase the power of the nation.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.840]   Sometimes they lead the nation to catastrophe.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.660]   It is rare that the final outcome will be what they initially intended to achieve.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.300]   Geopolitics assumes two things.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.420]   First it assumes that humans organize themselves into units larger than families, and the
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.400]   by doing this they must engage in politics.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.940]   It also assumes that humans have a natural loyalty to the things they were born into,
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.380]   the people and the places.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.660]   Loyalty to a tribe, a city, or a nation is natural to people.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.740]   In our time, national identity matters a great deal.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:58.540]   Geopolitics teaches that the relationship between these nations is a vital dimension
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.540]   of human life, and that means that war is ubiquitous.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.980]   Second, geopolitics assumes that the character of a nation is determined to a great extent
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:13.900]   by geography, as is the relationship between nations.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.940]   We use the term "geography" broadly.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.180]   It includes the physical characteristics of a location, but it goes beyond that to look
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.580]   at the effects of a place on individuals and communities.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.980]   In antiquity, the difference between Sparta and Athens was the difference between a landlocked
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.900]   city and a maritime empire.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.180]   Athens was wealthy and cosmopolitan, while Sparta was poor, provincial, and very tough.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:45.540]   A Spartan was very different from an Athenian in both culture and politics.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.260]   If you understand those assumptions, then it is possible to think about large numbers
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:56.780]   of human beings, linked together through natural human bonds, constrained by geography acting
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.660]   in certain ways.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.580]   The United States is the United States, and therefore must behave in a certain way.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.420]   The same goes for Japan or Turkey or Mexico.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:10.260]   When you drill down and see the forces that are shaping nations, you can see that the
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.620]   menu from which they choose is limited.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.820]   The 21st century will be like all other centuries.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:24.700]   There will be wars, there will be poverty, there will be triumphs and defeats, there
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.600]   will be tragedy and good luck.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.160]   People will go to work, make money, have children, fall in love, and come to hate.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.580]   That is the one thing that is not cyclical.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.860]   It is the permanent human condition.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.220]   The 21st century will be extraordinary in two senses.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:44.020]   It will be the beginning of a new age, and it will see a new global power astride the
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.020]   world.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.520]   That doesn't happen very often.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   The author goes on and talks about his reason for saying that the 21st century will be an
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:58.480]   America-centric age, in chapter 1, entitled "The Dawn of the American Age," he gives
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   detailed conversations on the American empire, how it came to be, why it is so powerful,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.000]   and why it will continue to be powerful.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.280]   I think it's quite excellent and important to recognize that.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:20.440]   Sometimes it's easy to be hyperbolic about decline, but on every numerical dimension,
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:27.880]   the United States is extraordinarily powerful and will continue to be extraordinarily powerful.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:33.240]   Chapter 2 is entitled "Earthquake," where he talks about the US Jihadist war, and 2010
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:42.460]   gives several predictions that, in my estimation, by 2022, they have come true, almost fully.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:47.500]   Chapter 3 is entitled "Population, Computers, and Culture Wars," wherein the author digs
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:53.240]   deeply into demographics and some of the culture wars in a really excellent way.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.800]   Chapter 4 is called "The New Fault Lines," and here's where I want to read a couple
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:03.240]   of excerpts that set the stage for what's happening in Eurasia, and then we'll go
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   specifically to the content related to the predicted war in Russia in 2020.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.040]   Chapter 4, "The New Fault Lines."
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.940]   Where will the next earthquake strike, and what will it look like?
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:19.020]   To answer that question, we need to examine the geopolitical fault lines of the 21st century.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.140]   As with geology, there are many such fault lines.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.240]   Without pushing this analogy too far, we have to identify the active fault lines in order
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.940]   to identify areas where friction might build up into conflict.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.840]   As the focus on the Islamic world subsides, what will be the most unstable point in the
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.580]   world in the next era?
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.780]   There are five areas of the world right now that are viable candidates.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.420]   First, there is the all-important Pacific Basin.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.780]   The United States Navy dominates the Pacific.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.620]   The Asian rim of the Pacific consists entirely of trading countries dependent on access to
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.780]   the high seas, which are therefore dependent on the United States.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.140]   Two of them, China and Japan, are major powers that could potentially challenge U.S. hegemony.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.100]   From 1941 to 1945, the United States and Japan fought over the Pacific Basin, and control
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.460]   of it remains a potential issue today.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:14.700]   Second, we must consider the future of Eurasia after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.420]   Since 1991, the region has fragmented and decayed.
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.960]   The successor state to the Soviet Union, Russia, is emerging from this period with renewed
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   self-confidence.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:30.540]   Yet, Russia is also in an untenable geopolitical position.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:36.040]   Unless Russia exerts itself to create a sphere of influence, the Russian Federation could
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.900]   itself fragment.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.260]   On the other hand, creating that sphere of influence could generate conflict with the
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.980]   United States and Europe.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   That's the key.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.980]   It goes on.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.180]   The third is that there's continuing doubt about the ultimate framework of Europe.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.820]   It talks about what Europe faces.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.060]   Fourth is the Islamic world.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.540]   Fifth is the question of Mexican-American relations.
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.540]   But let's talk about Eurasia.
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.580]   Eurasia.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.260]   For most of the second half of the 20th century, the Soviet Union controlled Eurasia, from
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:11.440]   central Germany to the Pacific, as far south as the Caucasus and the Hindu Kush.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:20.940]   When the Soviet Union collapsed, its western frontier moved east nearly a thousand miles
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.440]   from the West German border to the Russian border with Belarus.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.460]   From the Hindu Kush, its border moved northward a thousand miles to the Russian border with
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.300]   Kazakhstan.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:42.460]   Eurasia was pushed from the border of Turkey northward to the northern Caucasus, where
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.900]   it is still struggling to keep its foothold in the region.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.480]   Russian power has now retreated farther east than it has been in centuries.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.620]   During the Cold War, it had moved farther west than ever before.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:59.300]   In the coming decades, Russian power will settle somewhere between those two lines.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.820]   After the Soviet Union dissolved at the end of the 20th century, foreign powers moved
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:10.140]   in to take advantage of Russia's economy, creating an era of chaos and poverty.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:15.580]   They also moved rapidly to integrate as much as they could of the Russian Empire into their
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.300]   own spheres of influence.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:24.000]   Eastern Europe was absorbed into NATO and the EU, and the Baltic states were also absorbed
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.500]   into NATO.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.740]   The United States entered into a close relationship with both Georgia in the Caucasus and with
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.940]   many of the Central Asian "Stans," particularly after September 11, when the Russians allowed
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:41.580]   U.S. forces into the area to wage the war in Afghanistan.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:50.980]   Most significantly, Ukraine moved into an alignment with the United States and away
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.900]   from Russia.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.300]   This was a breaking point in Russian history.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:03.100]   The Orange Revolution in Ukraine, from December 2004 to January 2005, was the moment when
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.220]   the post-Cold War genuinely ended for Russia.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:13.420]   The Russians saw the events in Ukraine as an attempt by the United States to draw Ukraine
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.820]   into NATO, and thereby set the stage for Russian disintegration.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.380]   Quite frankly, there was some truth to the Russian perception.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:29.900]   If the West had succeeded in dominating Ukraine, Russia would have become indefensible.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.740]   The southern border with Belarus, as well as the southwestern frontier of Russia, would
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.740]   have been wide open.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:43.700]   In addition, the distance between Ukraine and western Kazakhstan is only about 400 miles,
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:50.140]   and that is the gap through which Russia has been able to project power toward the Caucasus.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:55.820]   We should assume, then, that under these circumstances, Russia would have lost its ability to control
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:01.620]   the Caucasus, and would have had to retreat farther north from Chechnya.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.420]   The Russians would have been abandoning parts of the Russian Federation itself, and Russia's
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.820]   own southern flank would become highly vulnerable.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:15.100]   Russia would have continued to fragment until it returned to its medieval frontiers.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:21.020]   Had Russia fragmented to this extent, it would have created chaos in Eurasia, to which the
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:26.500]   United States would not have objected, since the US grand strategy has always aimed for
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:32.140]   the fragmentation of Eurasia as the first line of defense for US control of the seas,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.140]   as we have seen.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:39.580]   By the way, in chapter one of the story of the book, the author talks extensively about
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:44.980]   how US naval power is fundamental to understanding global geopolitics and the strength of the
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.540]   United States' faces.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.820]   So the United States had every reason to encourage this process.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.660]   Russia had every reason to block it.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:44:01.060]   After what Russia regarded as an American attempt to further damage it, Moscow reverted
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.740]   to a strategy of reasserting its sphere of influence in the areas of the former Soviet
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.060]   Union.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:11.900]   The great retreat of Russian power ended in Ukraine.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:17.140]   Russian influence is now increasing in three directions, toward Central Asia, toward the
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:22.860]   Caucasus, and inevitably toward the West, the Baltics and Eastern Europe.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:30.340]   For the next generation, until roughly 2020, Russia's primary concern will be reconstructing
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:37.020]   the Russian state and reasserting Russian power in the region.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:42.620]   Interestingly, the geopolitical shift is aligning with an economic shift.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:50.180]   Vladimir Putin sees Russia less as an industrial power than as an exporter of raw materials,
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:54.860]   the most important of which is energy, particularly natural gas.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:45:00.020]   Moving to bring the energy industry under state supervision, if not direct control,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:07.080]   he is forcing out foreign interests and reorienting the industry toward exports, particularly
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.500]   to Europe.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.940]   High energy prices have helped stabilize Russia's economy internally, but he will not confine
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.020]   his efforts to energy alone.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.660]   He also is seeking to capitalize on Russian agriculture, timber, gold, diamonds, and other
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:21.820]   commodities.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:29.980]   He is transforming Russia from an impoverished disaster into a poor but more productive country.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:35.580]   Putin also is giving Russia the tool with which to intimidate Europe, the valve on a
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.220]   natural gas pipeline.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.300]   Russia is pressing back along its frontiers.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:45.500]   It is deeply focused on Central Asia and will, over time, find success there, but Russia
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:50.020]   will have a more difficult time in the even more crucial Caucasus.
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.780]   The Russians do not intend to allow any part of the Russian Federation to break away.
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.860]   As a result, there will be friction, particularly in the next decade, with the United States
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.820]   and other countries in the region, as Russia reasserts itself.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.860]   But the real flashpoint, in all likelihood, will be on Russia's western frontier.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.860]   Belarus will align itself with Russia.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.620]   Of all the countries in the former Soviet Union, Belarus has had the fewest economic
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.020]   and political reforms and has been the most interested in recreating some successor to
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.900]   the Soviet Union.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.220]   Linked in some way to Russia, Belarus will bring Russian power back to the borders of
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.380]   the former Soviet Union.
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.100]   From the Baltic's south to the Romanian border, there is a region where borders have
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.300]   historically been uncertain and conflict frequent.
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.400]   In the north, there is a long, narrow plain stretching from the Pyrenees to St. Petersburg.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.140]   This is where Europe's greatest wars were fought.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.860]   This is the path that Napoleon and Hitler took to invade Russia.
[00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.660]   There are few natural barriers.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:55.640]   Therefore, the Russians must push their border west as far as possible to create a buffer.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.460]   After World War II, they drove into the center of Germany on this plain.
[00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.260]   Today, they have retreated to the east.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.720]   They have to return and move as far west as possible.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:11.620]   That means the Baltic states and Poland are, as before, problems Russia has to solve.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.420]   Defining the limits of Russian influence will be controversial.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.780]   The United States and the countries within the old Soviet sphere will not want Russia
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.580]   to go too far.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:25.420]   The last thing the Baltic states want is to fall under Russian domination again.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.540]   Consider the states south of the northern European plain in the Carpathians.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:34.780]   The former Soviet satellites, particularly Poland, Hungary, and Romania, understand that
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:39.860]   the return of Russian forces to their frontiers would represent a threat to their security.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.580]   Since these countries are now part of NATO, their interests necessarily affect the interests
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.760]   of Europe and the United States.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:51.020]   The open question is where the line will be drawn in the west.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:55.540]   This has been a historical question and it was a key challenge in Europe over the past
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.460]   hundred years.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:02.940]   Russia will not become a global power in the next decade, but it has no choice but to become
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.500]   a major regional power.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.980]   That means it will clash with Europe.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.980]   The Russian-European frontier remains a fault line.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.540]   The author goes on and talks about some of the other fault lines.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:22.460]   Chapter 5 is called China 2020, Paper Tiger, wherein he discusses extensively China.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:27.460]   And then chapter 6 is called Russia 2020, Rematch.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:32.660]   And here is where we get the most important understanding of what's happening right now.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:37.540]   Again, this is predicted back in 2010.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.540]   In geopolitics, major conflicts repeat themselves.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:46.900]   France and Germany, for example, fought multiple wars, as did Poland and Russia.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:51.860]   When a single war does not resolve an underlying geopolitical issue, it is re-fought until
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.540]   the issue is finally settled.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:49:00.300]   At the very least, even without another war, tension and confrontation are ongoing.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:05.780]   Significant conflicts are rooted in underlying realities, and they do not go away easily.
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.580]   Keep in mind how quickly Balkan geopolitics led to a recurrence of wars that had been
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.220]   fought a century earlier.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:18.140]   Russia is the eastern portion of Europe and has clashed with the rest of Europe on multiple
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.660]   occasions.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:26.020]   The Napoleonic Wars, the two World Wars, and the Cold War all dealt, at least in part,
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.260]   with the status of Russia and its relationship to the rest of Europe.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:34.980]   None of these wars ultimately settled this question, because in the end a united and
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.500]   independent Russia survived or triumphed.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:44.060]   The problem is that the very existence of a united Russia poses a significant potential
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.580]   challenge to Europe.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.220]   Russia is a vast region with a huge population.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.620]   It is much poorer than the rest of Europe, but it has two assets – land and natural
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.260]   resources.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:03.540]   As such, it is a constant temptation for European powers, which see an opportunity to increase
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.380]   their size and wealth to the east.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:12.300]   Historically, though, Europeans who have invaded Russia have come to a disastrous end.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.880]   If they are not beaten by the Russians, they are so exhausted from fighting them that someone
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.020]   else defeats them.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:24.720]   Russia occasionally pushes its power westward, threatening Europe with the Russian masses.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:30.380]   At other times, passive and ignored, Russia is often taken advantage of, but in due course
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:33.160]   others pay for underestimating it.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.780]   The Cold War only appeared to have settled the Russian question.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:41.340]   Had the Russian Federation collapsed in the 1990s and the region fragmented into multiple
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:47.060]   smaller states, Russian power would have disappeared, and with it the challenge Russian power poses
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.260]   to Europe.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.820]   Had the Americans, Europeans, and Chinese moved in for the kill, the Russian question
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.220]   would have been finally settled.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.140]   But the Europeans were too weak and divided at the end of the 20th century, the Chinese
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:07.260]   too isolated and preoccupied with internal issues, and, after September 11, 2001, the
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.820]   Americans were too distracted by the Islamist war to act decisively.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.060]   What actions were taken by the United States were insufficient and unfocused.
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:20.760]   In fact, these actions only served to alert the Russians to the great potential danger
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:25.680]   from the United States and ensured they would respond to it.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.420]   Given the simple fact that Russia did not disintegrate, the Russian geopolitical question
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:33.560]   will re-emerge.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.260]   Given the fact that Russia is now re-energizing itself, that question will come sooner rather
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.640]   than later.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.700]   The conflict will not be a repeat of the Cold War any more than World War I was a repeat
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:52.560]   of the Napoleonic Wars, but it will be a restatement of the fundamental Russian question.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.180]   If Russia is a United Nations state, where will its frontiers lie and what will be the
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.460]   relationship between Russia and its neighbors?
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:07.220]   That question will represent the next major phase in world history, in 2020 and in the
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.300]   years leading up to it.
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.660]   Russian Dynamics If we are going to understand Russia's behavior
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:19.320]   and intentions, we have to begin with Russia's fundamental weakness, its borders, particularly
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.260]   in the Northwest.
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.600]   Even when Ukraine is controlled by Russia, as it has been for centuries, and Belarus
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:32.840]   and Moldovia are part of the Russian Empire as well, there are still no natural borders
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.660]   in the North.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:40.260]   The center and south are anchored on the Carpathian Mountains, as far north as the Slovakian-Polish
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:46.040]   border, and to the east of them are the Pripet Marshes, boggy and impassable.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:52.940]   But in the north and south, east of the Carpathians, there are no strong barriers to protect Russia,
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.500]   or to protect Russia's neighbors.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.560]   On the northern European plain, no matter where Russia's borders are drawn, it is
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.500]   open to attack.
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.580]   There are few significant natural barriers anywhere on this plain.
[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:13.980]   Pushing its western border all the way into Germany, as it did in 1945, still leaves Russia's
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.300]   borders without a physical anchor.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:21.580]   The only physical advantage Russia can have is depth.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:26.380]   The farther west into Europe its borders extend, the farther conquerors have to travel to reach
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:27.380]   Moscow.
[00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:33.180]   Therefore, Russia is always pressing westward on the northern European plain, and Europe
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.080]   is always pressing eastward.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.260]   That is not the case with other borders of Russia, by which we mean to include the former
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:45.380]   Soviet Union, which has been the rough shape of Russia since the end of the 19th century.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.580]   In the south, there was a natural secure boundary.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:53.620]   The Black Sea leads to the Caucasus, separating Russia from Turkey and Iran.
[00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:59.220]   Iran is further buffered by the Caspian Sea, and by the Karakum Desert in southern Turkmenistan,
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.920]   which runs along the Afghan border, terminating in the Himalayas.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.180]   The Russians are concerned with the Iranian-Afghan segment, and might push south, as they have
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.100]   done several times.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.960]   But they are not going to be invaded on that border.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.260]   Their frontier with China is long and vulnerable, but only on a map.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:20.460]   Invading Siberia is not a practical possibility.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.900]   It is a vast wilderness.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:27.220]   There is a potential weakness along China's western border, but not a significant one.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:33.140]   Therefore, the Russian Empire, in any of its incarnations, is fairly secure, except in
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:38.900]   northern Europe, where it faces its worst dangers, geography, and powerful European
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.620]   nations.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.420]   Russia had its guts carved out after the collapse of communism.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:51.020]   St. Petersburg, its jewel, was about a thousand miles away from NATO troops in 1989.
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:54.620]   Now it is less than 100 miles away.
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:59.860]   In 1989, Moscow was 1,200 miles from the limits of Russian power.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.960]   Now it is about 200 miles.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:08.620]   In the south, with Ukraine independent, the Russian hold on the Black Sea is tenuous,
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.780]   and it has been forced to the northern extreme of the Caucasus.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.700]   Afghanistan is occupied, however tentatively, by the Americans, and Russia's anchor on
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.820]   the Himalayas is gone.
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:27.300]   If there were an army interested in invading, the Russian Federation is virtually indefensible.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:33.660]   Russia's strategic problem is that it is a vast country with relatively poor transportation.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.780]   If Russia were simultaneously attacked along its entire periphery, in spite of the size
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.540]   of its forces, it would be unable to easily protect itself.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:46.780]   It would have difficulty mobilizing forces and deploying them to multiple fronts, so
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:51.900]   it would have to maintain an extremely large standing army that could be pre-deployed.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:57.380]   This pressure imposes a huge economic burden on Russia, undermines the economy, and causes
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.380]   it to buckle from within.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:01.420]   That is what happened to the Soviet state.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.720]   Of course, this is not the first time Russia has been in peril.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:09.340]   Protecting its frontiers is not Russia's only problem today.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:14.940]   The Russians are extremely well aware that they are facing a massive demographic crisis.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:20.560]   Russia's current population is about 145 million people, and projections for 2050 are
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.420]   for between 90 million and 125 million.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.020]   Time is working against it.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:31.380]   Russia's problem will soon be its ability to field an army sufficient for its strategic
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.380]   needs.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:36.740]   Internally, the number of Russians compared to other ethnic groups is declining, placing
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:40.960]   intense pressure on Russia to make a move sooner rather than later.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:45.340]   In its current geographical position, it is an accident waiting to happen.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:50.680]   Given Russia's demographic trajectory, in 20 years it may be too late to act, and its
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.240]   leaders know this.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:58.000]   It does not have to conquer the world, but Russia must regain and hold its buffers, essentially
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.140]   the boundaries of the old Soviet Union.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:05.120]   Between their geopolitical, economic, and demographic problems, the Russians have to
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.240]   make a fundamental shift.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:12.280]   For a hundred years, the Russians sought to modernize their country through industrialization,
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.560]   trying to catch up to the rest of Europe.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.840]   They never managed to pull it off.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.480]   Around 2000, Russia shifted its strategy.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.680]   Instead of focusing on industrial development as they had in the past century, the Russians
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:32.800]   reinvented themselves as exporters of natural resources, particularly energy, but also minerals,
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.880]   agricultural products, lumber, and precious metals.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:40.440]   By deemphasizing industrial development and emphasizing raw materials, the Russians took
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.360]   a very different path, one more common to countries in the developing world.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:51.000]   But given the unexpected rise of energy and commodity prices, this move not only saved
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.240]   the Russian economy but also strengthened it to the point where Russia could afford
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   to drive its own selective re-industrialization.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:04.120]   Most important, since natural resource production is less manpower intensive than industrial
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:10.400]   production, it gave Russia an economic base that could be sustained with a declining population.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:14.040]   It also gave Russia leverage in the international system.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.200]   Europe is hungry for energy.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.880]   Russia, constructing pipelines to feed natural gas to Europe, takes care of Europe's energy
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:27.680]   needs and its own economic problems, and puts Europe in a position of dependency on Russia.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:33.280]   In an energy-hungry world, Russia's energy exports are like heroin.
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.400]   It addicts countries once they start using it.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.520]   Russia has already used its natural gas resources to force neighboring countries to bend to
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.920]   its will.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:46.160]   That power reaches into the heart of Europe, where the Germans and the former Soviet satellites
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.080]   of Eastern Europe all depend on Russian natural gas.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:56.360]   Add to this its other resources and Russia can apply significant pressure on Europe.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.640]   Dependency can be a double-edged sword.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:02.780]   A militarily weak Russia cannot pressure its neighbors because its neighbors might decide
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.880]   to make a grab for its wealth.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.320]   So Russia must recover its military strength.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.360]   Rich and weak is a bad position for nations to be in.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.200]   If Russia is to be rich in natural resources and export them to Europe, it must be in a
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.600]   position to protect what it has and to shape the international environment in which it
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.000]   lives.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.440]   In the next decade, Russia will become increasingly wealthy, relative to its past at least, but
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.600]   geographically insecure.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.480]   It will therefore use some of its wealth to create a military force appropriate to protect
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:40.360]   its interests, buffer zones to protect it from the rest of the world, and then buffer
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.280]   zones for the buffer zones.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:48.560]   Russia's grand strategy involves the creation of deep buffers along the northern European
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:53.080]   plain while it divides and manipulates its neighbors, creating a new regional balance
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.800]   of power in Europe.
[00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.760]   What Russia cannot tolerate are tight borders without buffer zones, and its neighbors united
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.360]   against it.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:08.760]   This is why Russia's future actions will appear to be aggressive, but will actually
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.680]   be defensive.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.720]   Russia's actions will unfold in three phases.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.120]   In the first phase, Russia will be concerned with recovering influence and effective control
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.720]   in the former Soviet Union, recreating the system of buffers that the Soviet Union provided
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.720]   it.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.120]   In the second phase, Russia will seek to create a second tier of buffers beyond the boundaries
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.080]   of the former Soviet Union.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.920]   It will try to do this without creating a solid wall of opposition, or of the kind that
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.220]   choked it during the Cold War.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:49.840]   In the third phase, Russia will try to prevent anti-Russian coalitions from forming.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:56.160]   In referring to the, from here, the author goes on, talks about the history of the Soviet
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:02.600]   Union and why the Soviet Union was built that way, then talks about the frontiers of Russia,
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:10.280]   the first one being the Caucasus, the second one being the Central Asia, and then turns
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.120]   attention to, turns attention to Europe.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.480]   I want to read an excerpt from the Central Asia section, though, because I think this
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.760]   helps to understand some of the Russian tension with the United States.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.240]   And then we'll talk about Europe, which is where we come to Ukraine.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240]   Central Asia.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.100]   Central Asia is a vast region running between the Caspian Sea and the Chinese border.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.520]   It is primarily Muslim, and therefore, as we have seen, was part of the massive destabilization
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.160]   that took place in the Muslim world after the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.740]   By itself, it has some economic value as a region with energy reserves, but it has little
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.720]   strategic importance to the Russians, unless another great power was to dominate it and
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.800]   use it as a base against them.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.000]   If that were to happen, it would become enormously important.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.460]   Whoever controls Kazakhstan would be a hundred miles from the Volga, a river highway for
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.360]   Russian agriculture.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.640]   During the 1990s, Western energy companies flocked to the region.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.960]   Russia had no problem with that.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.000]   It wasn't in a position to compete, and it wasn't in a position to control the
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.980]   region militarily.
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.580]   Central Asia was a neutral zone of relative indifference to the Russians.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:24.640]   All of that changed on September 11, 2001, which redefined the geopolitics of the region.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.800]   September 11 made it urgent for the United States to invade Afghanistan.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.400]   Unable to mount an invasion by itself quickly, the United States asked the Russians for help.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.280]   One thing they asked for was Russian help in getting the Northern Alliance, an anti-Taliban
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.220]   group in Afghanistan to play the major role on the ground.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.400]   The Russians had sponsored the Northern Alliance and effectively controlled it.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.360]   Another thing the Americans asked for was Russian support in securing bases for the
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.840]   United States in several Central Asian countries.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.640]   Technically, these were independent countries, but the United States was asking for help
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.200]   with the Northern Alliance and couldn't afford to anger the Russians.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:08.360]   The Central Asian countries did not want to anger the Russians either, and US planes had
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.000]   to fly over the former Soviet Union to get to them.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.360]   The Russians agreed to an American military presence in the region, thinking they had
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.760]   an understanding with the United States that this was a temporary situation.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.440]   But as the war in Afghanistan dragged on, the United States stayed on.
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.960]   And as it stayed on, it became more and more influential with the various republics in
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.720]   the region.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:40.000]   Russia realized that what had been a benign buffer zone was becoming dominated by the
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.720]   main global power, a power that was pressing Russia in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Baltics.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.560]   In addition, as the price of energy rose and Russia adopted its new economic strategy,
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.360]   Central Asia's energy became even more significant.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:00.640]   Russia did not want American forces a hundred miles from the Volga.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.680]   Russia simply had to react.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.120]   It didn't act directly, but it began manipulating the political situation in the region, reducing
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.680]   American power.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.360]   It was a move designed to return Central Asia to the Russian sphere of influence, and the
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.680]   Americans, on the other side of the world, isolated by chaotic Afghanistan, Iran, and
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.160]   Pakistan, were in no position to resist.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.080]   The Russians reasserted their natural position, and tellingly it was one of the few places
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.160]   US naval power couldn't reach.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.360]   Central Asia is an area where the United States can't remain under Russian pressure.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.240]   It is a place where the Chinese could potentially cause problems, but as we've seen, that
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.960]   is unlikely to happen.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.540]   China has economic influence there, but the Russians in the end have both military and
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.960]   financial capabilities that can out-duel them.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.560]   The Russians might offer China access to Central Asia, but the arrangements created in the
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:56.000]   19th century and maintained by the Soviet Union will reassert themselves.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.360]   For it is my view that Central Asia will be back in the Russian sphere of influence by
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:06.640]   the early 2010s, long before the major confrontation begins in the West, in Europe.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.520]   The European Theater The European Theater is, of course, the area
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.460]   directly west of Russia.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:15.680]   In this region, Russia's western border faces the three Baltic states.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:25.120]   By the way, I couldn't comment knowledgeably on the difference between the 2010s, 2015,
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:32.200]   and 2020, but I do think it's interesting in light of this kind of analysis that it
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.440]   was just last year that the United States fully withdrew from Afghanistan.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.560]   So I think this will be an interesting point of analysis for political or geopolitical
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:47.280]   analysts to try to understand the timing of Russia's moves with regard to the US withdrawal
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.280]   from Afghanistan.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.520]   The European Theater The European Theater is, of course, the area
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.400]   directly west of Russia.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.080]   In this region, Russia's western border faces the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia,
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.600]   and Lithuania, and the two independent republics of Belarus and Ukraine.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.000]   All of these were part of the former Soviet Union and of the Russian Empire.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.680]   Beyond these countries lies the belt of former Soviet satellites – Poland, Slovakia, Hungary,
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.980]   Romania, and Bulgaria.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:32.720]   The Russians must dominate Belarus and Ukraine for their basic national security.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.320]   The Baltics are secondary but still important.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.080]   Eastern Europe is not critical so long as the Russians are anchored in the Carpathian
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.760]   Mountains in the south and have strong forces on the northern European plain.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   But of course all of this can get complicated.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.520]   Ukraine and Belarus are everything to the Russians.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:59.440]   If they were to fall into an enemy's hands, for example, join NATO, Russia would be in
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.600]   mortal danger.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:07.120]   Moscow is only a bit over 200 miles from the Russian border with Belarus, Ukraine less
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:13.120]   than 200 miles from Volgograd, formerly Stalingrad.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.440]   Russia defended against Napoleon and Hitler with depth.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.180]   Without Belarus and Ukraine there is no depth, no land to trade for an enemy's blood.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:28.120]   It is of course absurd to imagine NATO posing a threat to Russia.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:33.200]   But the Russians think in terms of 20-year cycles and they know how quickly the absurd
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.240]   becomes possible.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.480]   They also know that the United States and NATO have systematically expanded their reach
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.640]   by extending membership in NATO to Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.440]   As soon as the United States began trying to recruit Ukraine into NATO, the Russians
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.020]   changed their view both of American intentions and of Ukraine.
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:01.680]   From the Russian point of view, NATO expanding into Ukraine threatens Russian interests in
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.720]   the same way as if the Warsaw Pact had moved into Mexico.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:12.560]   When a pro-Western uprising in 2004, the "Orange Revolution", seemed about to sweep Ukraine
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.880]   into NATO, the Russians accused the United States of trying to surround and destroy Russia.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.640]   What the Americans were thinking is open to debate.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.960]   That Ukraine in NATO would be potentially devastating to Russian national security is
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.280]   not.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.940]   The Russians did not mobilize their army.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.560]   Rather they mobilized their intelligence service, whose covert connections in Ukraine were superb.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.280]   The Russians undermined the Orange Revolution, playing on a split between pro-Russian Eastern
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:44.500]   Ukraine and pro-European Western Ukraine.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:49.620]   It proved not to be difficult at all, and fairly quickly Ukrainian politics became gridlocked.
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.660]   It is only a matter of time before Russian influence will overwhelm Kiev.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.060]   Belarus is an easier issue.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:00.300]   As noted earlier, Belarus is the least reformed member of the former Soviet Republics.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.500]   It remains a centralized authoritarian state.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:07.220]   More important, its leadership has repeatedly mourned the passing of the Soviet Union and
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.180]   has proposed union of some sort with Russia.
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.420]   Such a union will, of course, have to be on Russian terms, which has led to tension, but
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.900]   there is no possibility of Belarus joining NATO.
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:23.320]   The reabsorption of Belarus and Ukraine into the Russian sphere of influence is a given
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.300]   in the next five years.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.940]   When that happens, Russia will have roughly returned to its borders with Europe between
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.620]   the two world wars.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:34.620]   It will be anchored in the Caucasus in the south, with Ukraine protected, and in the
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.980]   north its borders on the northern European plain will abut Poland and the Baltic countries.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.540]   That will pose the questions of who the most powerful country in the north is and where
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:46.740]   the precise frontiers will be.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.900]   The real flashpoint will be the Baltics.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:54.180]   The traditional path to invade Russia is a 300-mile gap between the northern Carpathians
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.000]   and the Baltic Sea.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.100]   This is flat, easily traversed country with few river barriers.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.860]   This northern European plain is a smooth ride for invaders.
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:09.440]   A European invader can move due east to Moscow or to St. Petersburg in the northwest.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.220]   During the Cold War, the distance from St. Petersburg to NATO's front line was also
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.940]   more than a thousand miles.
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.180]   Today, the distance is about 70 miles.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.620]   This explains the strategic nightmare Russia faces in the Baltics, and what it will need
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.740]   to do to fix the problem.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:29.420]   The three Baltic countries were once part of the Soviet Union.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.740]   Each became independent after it collapsed, and then in that narrow window each became
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.480]   part of NATO.
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.460]   As we have seen, the Europeans are most likely too far into their decadent cycle to have
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:43.060]   the energy to take advantage of the situation.
[01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:47.380]   However, the Russians are not going to risk their national security on that assumption.
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:55.380]   They saw Germany go from being a cripple in 1932 to being at the gates of Moscow in 1941.
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.780]   The inclusion of the Baltic countries along with Poland and NATO has moved NATO's frontier
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.940]   extraordinarily close to the Russian heartland.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:08.840]   For a country that was invaded three times in the last 200 years, the comfortable assumption
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:14.340]   that NATO and its members are no threat is not something it can risk.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.020]   From the Russian point of view, the major invasion route into their country is not only
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.540]   wide open but also in the hands of countries with a pronounced hostility to Russia.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.160]   The Baltic countries have never forgiven the Russians for their occupation.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.660]   The Poles are equally bitter and deeply distrustful of Russian intentions.
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.860]   Now that they are a part of NATO, these countries form the front line.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:41.500]   Behind them is Germany, a country as distrusted by Russia as Russia is by the Poles and Balts.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.900]   The Russians are certainly paranoid, but that doesn't mean they don't have enemies or
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.980]   that they are crazy.
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.180]   This would be the point of any confrontation.
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.500]   The Russians can live with a neutral Baltic region.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.340]   Living with a Baltic region that is part of NATO and close to the Americans, however,
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.940]   is a much more difficult risk to take.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.780]   On the other hand, the Americans, having backed down in Central Asia and being cautious in
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.460]   the Caucasus, can't retreat from the Baltics.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:12.140]   Any compromise over the three NATO members would send Eastern Europe into a panic.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.340]   Eastern Europe's behavior would become unpredictable, and the possibility of Russian influence spreading
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.780]   westward would increase.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.300]   Russia has the greater interest, but the Americans could bring substantial power to bear if they
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.300]   chose.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:30.700]   Russia's next move likely will be an agreement with Belarus for an integrated defense system.
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:34.260]   Belarus and Russia have been linked for a very long time, so this will be a natural
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.260]   reversion.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:38.020]   And that will bring the Russian army to the Baltic frontier.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.020]   It will also bring the army to the Polish frontier, and that will start the confrontation
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.180]   in its full intensity.
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:47.900]   The Poles fear the Russians and the Germans.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:54.140]   Trapped between the two, without natural defenses, they fear whichever is stronger at any time.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.020]   Unlike the rest of Eastern Europe, which at least has the barrier of the Carpathians between
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.500]   them and the Russians, and shares a border with Ukraine, not Russia, the Poles are on
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.380]   the dangerous northern European plane.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.820]   When the Russians return to their border and force, in the process of confronting the Baltic
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.980]   states, the Poles will react.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:14.620]   Poland has almost 40 million people.
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:19.220]   It is not a small country, and since it will be backed by the United States, not a trivial
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.380]   one.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.740]   Polish support will be thrown behind the bolts.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.220]   The Russians will pull the Ukrainians into their alliance with Belarus, and will have
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:31.500]   Russian forces all along the Polish border, and as far south as the Black Sea.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.300]   At this point, the Russians will begin the process of trying to neutralize the Balts.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.980]   This I believe will all take place by the mid-2010s.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:42.420]   The Russians will have three tools at their disposal to exert their influence over the
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.740]   Baltic states.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.820]   First, covert operations.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.620]   In the same way the United States has financed and energized non-governmental organizations
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:55.520]   around the world, the Russians will finance and energize Russian minorities in these countries,
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.140]   as well as whatever pro-Russian elements exist or can be bought.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.220]   When the Balts suppress these movements, it will give the Russians a pretext for using
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:07.340]   their second tool, economic sanctions, particularly by cutting the flow of natural gas.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:11.160]   Finally, the Russians will bring military pressure to bear through the presence of substantial
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.220]   forces near these borders.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.340]   Not surprisingly, the Poles and the Balt both remember the unpredictability of the Russians.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.860]   The psychological pressure will be enormous.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:29.300]   Let's skip a little bit about advanced military technologies.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:39.060]   But the point of what is happening is you can see the place the Russians are caught.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:46.860]   You can see that even according to this particular prediction, the Russians are behind schedule,
[01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:54.820]   meaning what the author was writing about in 2010 didn't wind up happening by 2015.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:58.140]   Now there's more and I'm not going to put my mouth and stick my foot in it by trying
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:02.940]   to comment on it, but some of the things that happened in Ukraine in 2014, the Russians
[01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:08.220]   alleged US involvement, the previous president of Ukraine I think is in prison right now
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:11.820]   and was replaced by the current president and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.740]   And then I think it's so interesting to think about the Ukrainian connection to the current
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:21.660]   administration of President Biden with his son, the Burisma affair, etc.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.380]   It's so fascinating to think about what has been happening.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:32.300]   But you can see that what Russia is doing is seeking to secure its borders in the way
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.580]   that is said here.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:40.180]   So that can give a little bit of insight into what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.260]   Now I've already abused the author's copyright on the book.
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.540]   I'm going to stop there.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.580]   I'm going to encourage you to get it and read it.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.700]   It's a great book and I'm glad that I was able to go through it again.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.140]   I wish I had remembered more of it.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:16:00.380]   Again the primary thing that I took from it was a little bit of information from 10 years
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:06.100]   ago as I remembered the commentary on demographics on a global basis and also the commentary
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.100]   on Mexico.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.260]   And those two things have been influential to me.
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:14.340]   But I had forgotten most of the stuff related to Russia and Ukraine and just simply not
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:17.620]   followed it closely over the years.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:21.740]   But I hope you enjoy the book and I hope having a little bit more insight into what's happening
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:26.980]   from the Russian point of view you can see a little bit more of what's happening.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:33.460]   And then in the days to come as we see an incredibly united front against Russia, watch
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:39.660]   carefully because it'll be fascinating to see what happens along the way.
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:46.140]   So I hope that you enjoy that insight from again an author writing 10 years ago, nothing
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.700]   coming back to today.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:58.020]   I want to simply close with "Where Does It End?"
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.580]   And I'll just give a couple of things.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:04.340]   So again this book, it hasn't come out exactly as intended.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.020]   One of the things that's interesting is why didn't it?
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.740]   And I didn't pay much attention to the global geopolitics over the last six or eight years
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:18.060]   but it's really interesting to go back now and in light of what I've reread over the
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.980]   last couple of days think about what happened, right?
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.820]   Did, for example, the American president make a difference?
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:30.540]   There was all the arguments about Russia and President Trump and what Putin would or wouldn't
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.620]   do and all of those things.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:33.620]   I don't know.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.340]   But where does it end?
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:40.940]   And so again this particular prediction in 2010 didn't come true exactly in the timeline.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:45.820]   It seems to be delayed from what the author originally thought would happen.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:53.580]   But I thought it was interesting to focus on the end result as predicted by this author
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:57.980]   because he talks about it.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:05.500]   He talks about how Russia will focus on increasing, developing its internal, solving its economic
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.260]   problems, which Russia has clearly worked hard on doing.
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.340]   And let's start here.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.420]   "By 2020 this confrontation will be the dominant global issue and everyone will think of it
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.260]   as a permanent problem.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.940]   The confrontation will not be as comprehensive as the first Cold War.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:26.340]   The Russians will lack the power to seize all of Eurasia and there will not be a true
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:28.180]   global threat.
[01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:31.900]   They will, however, be a regional threat, and that is the context in which the United
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.580]   States will respond.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.180]   There will be tension all along the Russian frontier, but the United States will not be
[01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:43.260]   able to or need to impose a complete cordon around Russia as it did around the Soviet
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.700]   Union.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:50.580]   Given the confrontation, the European dependence on hydrocarbons, much of it derived from Russia,
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.020]   will become a strategic issue.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:58.500]   The American strategy will be to de-emphasize the focus on hydrocarbon energy sources.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.220]   This will kick into high gear the American interest in developing alternative sources
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.220]   of energy.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:07.980]   Russia, as before, will focus on its existing industries rather than on the development
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:09.420]   of new ones.
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.500]   That will mean increased oil and natural gas production, rather than new energy sources.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.720]   As a result, Russia is not going to be in the forefront of the technological developments
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.500]   that will dominate the later portions of the century.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.580]   Instead, Russia will need to develop its military capabilities.
[01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:28.700]   Thus, as it has over the past two centuries, Russia will devote the bulk of its research
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:33.900]   and development money to applying new technologies toward military ends and expanding existing
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:39.300]   industries causing it to fall behind the United States and the rest of the world in non-military
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.340]   but valuable technology.
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:46.260]   It will be particularly hurt, paradoxically, by its hydrocarbon riches, because it will
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:51.300]   not be motivated to develop new technologies and will be burdened by military spending.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.260]   During the first phase of Russia's reassertion of power until about 2010 or so, Russia will
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.100]   be grossly underestimated.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:03.140]   It will be perceived as a fractured country with a stagnant economy and a weak military.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:07.820]   In the 2010s, when the confrontation intensifies on its borders and its immediate neighbors
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:12.020]   become alarmed, the greater powers will continue to be dismissive.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:17.380]   The United States, in particular, tends to first underestimate and then overestimate
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.600]   enemies.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.140]   By the middle of the 2010s, the United States will again be obsessed with Russia.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.420]   There is an interesting process to observe here.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.500]   The United States swings between moods but actually, as we have seen, executes a very
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.360]   consistent and rational foreign policy.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.780]   In this case, the United States will move to its manic state that will focus on keeping
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:39.620]   Russia tied in knots without going to war.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:43.100]   It will matter a great deal where the fault line lies.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:48.380]   If Russia's resurgence is to be a minimal crisis, the Russians will dominate Central
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:54.020]   Asia and the Caucasus and possibly absorb Moldova, but they will not be able to absorb
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.580]   the Baltic states or dominate any nations west of the Carpathians.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:03.620]   If the Russians do manage to absorb the Baltics and gain significant allies in the Balkans
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:09.220]   like Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece, or Central European countries such as Slovakia, the competition
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:13.340]   between the United States and Russia will be more intense and frightening.
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.900]   In the end though, it won't truly matter.
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:27.840]   Russian military power will be severely strained, confronting the fraction of American military
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.260]   power that the United States decides to wield in responding to Russia's moves.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:38.340]   Regardless of what the rest of Europe does, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:44.700]   will be committed to resisting Russian advances, and will make any deal the United States wants
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.700]   in order to gain its support.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.980]   The line, therefore, will be drawn in the Carpathian Mountains this time, rather than
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.540]   in Germany as it was during the Cold War.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:57.460]   The Polish northern plains will be the main line of confrontation, but the Russians will
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   not move militarily.
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.380]   The causes that ignited this confrontation, and the Cold War before it, will impose the
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.300]   same outcome as the Cold War, this time with less effort for the United States.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.940]   The last confrontation occurred in Central Europe.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.840]   This one will take place much farther to the east.
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:20.180]   In the last confrontation, China was an ally of Russia, at least in the beginning.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.820]   In this case, China will be out of the game.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.020]   Last time, Russia was in complete control of the Caucasus, but now it will not be, and
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:30.680]   it will be facing American and Turkish pressure northward.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.580]   In the last confrontation, Russia had a large population, but this time around it has a
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.680]   smaller and declining population.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.100]   Internal pressure, particularly in the south, will divert Russian attention from the west,
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.180]   and eventually, without war, it will break.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:50.500]   Russia broke in 1917, and again in 1991, and the country's military will collapse once
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:56.720]   more shortly after 2020.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:02.500]   My aim in reading that to you was that you would have the opportunity to hear from a
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:11.260]   somewhat distant but expert voice a little bit about the context of Russia, so that you
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:15.620]   would then be able to use that as a filter through watching the events today.
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:24.300]   Again, that author's predictions have not come true exactly as he said, of course not.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.220]   Friedman I still find to be an extremely astute analyst.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:33.140]   If you're interested, he has a great newsletter and website called geopoliticalfutures.com.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:40.740]   You can subscribe at geopoliticalfutures.com for his posts and consulting work, his analysis,
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:44.100]   their forecasts, etc. from him and his entire team.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:51.580]   I appreciate his content very much, helping me to understand the world a little bit.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.540]   I would encourage you to read the whole book.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:59.820]   Of course, and he acknowledges right up front, predicting an entire century is a challenging
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.100]   thing, but it'll give you a sense of where we are.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.980]   I think that what's helpful to me about this kind of analysis, this kind of prediction,
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:10.820]   is it takes away some of the impact of the day-to-day events and helps me to focus on
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.100]   the big picture.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:17.420]   My hope is that if you're still here, you've been able to take this information, enjoy
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.820]   it, gain a little bit more understanding, and then you'll have a little bit more of
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:27.460]   a background to follow the news of today as we watch the events happening in that region
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:28.460]   of the world.
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:30.220]   May God bless you.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:33.300]   May God bring peace in the region.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.740]   That is my hope, my prayer.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:40.020]   My family and I are praying diligently that God would bring peace, would restrain the
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.780]   evildoers and bring peace and protect loss of life.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780]   War is hell.
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:47.660]   And I think we see that very clearly in front of us.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:54.580]   And so may God be with you and your families, and may God bring peace to the region.
