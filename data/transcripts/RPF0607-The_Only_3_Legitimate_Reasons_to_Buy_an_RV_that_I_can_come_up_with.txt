[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   That's your best move.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   I went through this conversation with a friend of mine,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   He and his wife are snowbirds.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   They don't enjoy being in the snow in the winter, so they like to fly south.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   They thought about buying an RV and traveling in an RV,
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   But ultimately their decision was simply to travel in an RV.
