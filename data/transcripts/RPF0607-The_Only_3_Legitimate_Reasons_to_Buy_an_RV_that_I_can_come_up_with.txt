[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.800]   the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.680]   and meaningful life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.800]   Today, we're going to focus a little bit on that word insight.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.000]   Specifically as it relates to the purchase of a recreational vehicle, an RV.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.160]   We're in the middle of an asset protection series here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.200]   Just finished up homestead exemptions.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.240]   We're next going to talk about retirement account exemptions, but in the middle of
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.120]   this asset protection series, I have a problem.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.600]   The problem is half of my audience loves technical financial planning
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.040]   and half of my audience hates it.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.640]   So I'm going to mix up that series with just a short discussion on RVs and today's
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.160]   show, the only three legitimate reasons to buy an RV, obviously that's a quite
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.440]   cocky statement, which I will expand on in a moment, but it's official.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.200]   My wife and I have officially ended our own RV trip.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.760]   We've been on the road for five months, traveled about 13,000 miles around the
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.600]   United States, essentially from one coast to the other, and in so doing, I have
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.840]   learned and analyzed quite a bit of the United States and quite a bit of this RV
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.520]   lifestyle.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.640]   I will share more on some of the personal lessons learned on that trip in a separate
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.080]   episode at some point, probably here in the month of December.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.920]   But today I want to talk about a show idea that has been on my head as I drive many
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.800]   thousands of miles, just looking and thinking and analyzing, and it is this.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.960]   There are only three legitimate reasons that I can find to buy an RV.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.080]   Now I will hasten to qualify that statement to say it's your money, your
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.680]   reasons, you do whatever you want.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.240]   But these are just three reasons that make sense to me.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.920]   And I think if you hear them and analyze your situation in light of them, you will
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.120]   probably make a better decision with regard to your potential purchase of an RV.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280]   Some people buy RVs and they're deeply happy with them.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.720]   Some people buy RVs and they find it's one of the more expensive wastes of money
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   that they have ever, well, frankly engaged in.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.760]   And so let me explain to you three good reasons to have an RV.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.640]   In a separate show, and I'll briefly mention at the end of the show, I'll give
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.920]   you an out, I'll give you a great compromise situation that I think will work
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   ideally for many people who are looking for a solution to an RV, but are concerned
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.360]   about buying a big fancy one.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.920]   So stay tuned for that towards the end.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.720]   Number one, the number one legitimate reason for you to buy an RV is if you want
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:07.240]   to comfortably sleep and live in a place where there are few or no hotels, the
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   number one reason for you to buy an RV is if you want to comfortably sleep, stay,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280]   and live where there are no hotels.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.920]   I have become fully persuaded that hotel living is a tremendous bargain.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.600]   The ability to just to rent a hotel room for one night or 20 nights, whatever you
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   like is a tremendous bargain.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.160]   And it is a much better bargain than buying an RV.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.560]   Even if you are a cheap person like me, even if you are obsessive about trying to
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.720]   get the best deal and save money, hotels are a bargain.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   They are cheap.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:57.080]   But there are a lot of places that you might like to be where there simply are no
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   hotels.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.760]   Perhaps the best example would be if you travel around the United States,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.560]   especially in the Western United States, you will find many millions of acres of
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:23.080]   wild land where you are legally free to stay and hunt, take pictures, hike, climb,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   engage in whatever your version of outdoor recreation is.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.600]   You're legally entitled to stay there, but there are no hotels there.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.480]   Now, don't miss the fact that you don't need an RV to stay in those places.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.080]   You can bring along a tent, you can roll out your bed, roll under the stars, you
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.240]   can sleep in your car.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.400]   There are all kinds of things you can do that don't involve an RV, which is why I
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.760]   use the word comfortably.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.000]   If you want to comfortably stay where there are no hotels, then an RV is a
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.200]   ticket that you will appreciate.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.280]   You see this especially out in the Western United States.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.920]   There is a big difference between the Eastern United States, the built up
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.800]   populous areas near the coast, and the Western United States, especially in
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   terms of RV ownership.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.320]   You can just see it as you drive down the road.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.040]   If you go out into the country, especially in the country in the Western United
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.560]   States, it seems as though virtually everybody has an RV in their driveway.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.560]   And that makes sense to me because there's so much land available where you
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.200]   can park, where you can recreate to your heart's content.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   And the RV brings a huge measure of comfort to that experience.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.960]   The RV brings the ability to run a heater when it's cold, a nice propane
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.360]   heater, and keep yourself warm.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.800]   It brings the ability to run an air conditioner when it's hot, a nice air
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.400]   conditioner, keep yourself cool.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.640]   It runs the ability to have a nice comfortable bed with a comfortable
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.680]   mattress where you're not lying on the floor on some thermo rest
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.120]   thing with a rock poking through.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.720]   It gives you the ability to have a shower, to have a bathroom, to have
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.640]   facilities where you can cook food and eat dinner together.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.840]   And an RV solves those things beautifully.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.160]   It brings comfort in a place where there are no hotels.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.440]   Many people do like going out with a tent.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   Many people do like going out and cooking their food.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.280]   But with the, you know, on the ground and the fire, but when you have an RV, you
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.080]   can live in those places, you can be comfortable in those places and since
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.880]   there are no hotels in those places, really, if you want that high level of
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.160]   comfort, an RV is your only solution.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.000]   Now, remember that there are many types of RVs and the bigger your RV, the less
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   off the beaten path you'll be able to go.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.440]   But an RV works beautifully in that situation.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.320]   There are other contexts as well.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.080]   Perhaps you enjoy going to the races or you enjoy going to the
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.600]   football games and tailgating.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.840]   RVs work wonderfully in those circumstances.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.440]   You can show up the night before, get a good night's sleep, be
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   parked on the inside track, be able to hang out all day with your buddies.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   When everyone else is fighting traffic, trying to leave, you're hanging out,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.080]   cracking the top on another beer while you sit there and enjoy the rest of the
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.720]   day, and then you leave the next morning.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.920]   Perhaps you like to go and race cars.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.680]   Well, you can be comfortable in your RV while you are at the track.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.120]   Perhaps you ride in the rodeo.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.400]   Well, you can stay comfortably in your RV, care for your horses
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   while you're there at the event.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   And so these are places where there are no hotels on the racetrack.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.120]   There are no hotels in the rodeo grounds, but your RV can be there and
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.600]   you can be quite comfortable there.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:51.720]   So if your travel goals or your lifestyle goals involve your traveling in places
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.600]   where there are no hotels, and if you want to comfortably stay in those places, an
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.960]   RV is a wonderful way for you to do that.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.320]   Legitimate reason number two for you to consider buying an RV is if you want to
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:13.680]   travel for a significantly extended period and you want to have your stuff settled
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.600]   around you so that you're not moving here and moving there.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.840]   Now, I believe that travel period needs to be significant,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.000]   needs to be quite extended.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   If you want to go on a two week family vacation to the national parks, I
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   recommend, if you want to stay at an RV, rent an RV.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.440]   It will be a better move for you to rent your RV than it will be for you to buy
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.600]   that.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.960]   And my observation is that people get it.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.200]   All every place I've been, you will see tons and tons of rental RVs.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.360]   I went to Grand Canyon National Park and there are dozens.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:54.280]   And the campground that's there for RVs, the big campground, there are dozens and
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.760]   dozens of rental RVs out there.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.360]   So people get this.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.760]   But you can rent a great RV and have a great trip if you want to do that for a
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.520]   short period of time.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.040]   And that is definitely financially the best move.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.480]   But if you want to travel for an extended period of time, I'm thinking months if
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.680]   not years, months if not years, then buying an RV is going to be a good
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.600]   solution for you.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:26.880]   I would caution you, however, don't first jump to the idea of RVing thinking that
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.720]   that's the only way for you to travel for an extended period of time.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.160]   RVing is not the only way for you to travel for an extended period of time.
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.560]   I go back to hotels and lodges and short term house rentals.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   There are so many places available that you can stay, that you can travel for a
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   very long time, years, without ever buying an RV.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.960]   And it might be the case that in your family situation, that's your best move.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.720]   I went through this conversation with a friend of mine who, he and his wife are
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.400]   snowbirds.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   They don't enjoy being in the snow in the winter, so they like to fly south.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.360]   And they thought about buying an RV and traveling in an RV.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.120]   But ultimately, their decision was simply to travel in their car and to stay in
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.280]   hotels along the way.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:22.080]   Now, if you have a spry and active middle-aged couple who is able to drive a
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.840]   small SUV around, they can fit all their things in an SUV without any problem.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.800]   They can drive an SUV, they can stay in hotels, and by not traveling frenetically,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.360]   by staying in a hotel at least for a few days at a time, if not weeks, if they're
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.680]   in a nice location, they can enjoy enough slowness of travel to really get a lot out
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.160]   of their trip.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.280]   And by not having a big rig that you have to drive around, you can get a high gas
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.640]   mileage.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   I mean, just simply do the math on this.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:55.440]   Consider the simple fuel cost of dragging around an RV with you.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.240]   So pretend for a moment that you didn't have to buy an RV.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.720]   Pretend for a moment that most of the ones that most people buy cost at minimum
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.840]   $30,000 for a travel trailer, up to many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.400]   nice, enjoyable RV.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.800]   So when I was traveling with a diesel pickup truck and a travel trailer, I can
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.400]   get about 10, basically I always get 10 miles per gallon.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.120]   Whenever I'm towing, I get 10 miles per gallon.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.600]   Now, we traveled a lot and you do not have to travel as much.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.880]   You don't have to drive as much.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.520]   Gas, the amount of diesel fuel you put in your truck is directly correlated to how
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.280]   much you travel.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.040]   But for our purposes, we traveled a lot.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.240]   And so let's, let me show you how the math works out.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.440]   We traveled about 13,000 miles on our recent five month trip.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.760]   And I want to, at the risk of wearing you out, repeat for the fourth time, we
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.600]   traveled a lot.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.720]   This is generally by every experienced traveler.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.880]   The normal course of action is when you start traveling, you move a lot.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   And then over time, people start to slow down.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.000]   We didn't want to travel as much as we did, but in order for us to get what we
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.120]   wanted out of our trip, we did travel a lot.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.720]   You don't have to move as much.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.680]   You could spend five months and drive a thousand miles.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.720]   We moved a lot.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:14.960]   So 13,000 miles at 10 miles per gallon, that comes out to 1,300 gallons of diesel
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.240]   fuel.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.080]   So if you assume we spent that we did, we use 1,300 gallons of diesel fuel.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.920]   And if we assume an average right now of about $3 and 20 cents a gallon for diesel,
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.080]   I'll have to go in.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.400]   I need to go and compute my own average since then, but I would say it's probably
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.840]   somewhere just north of $3.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.680]   So $3 and 20 cents per gallon of diesel, which if you're traveling in another
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.160]   place, it's a lot more expensive.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.440]   Thankfully in the United States, it's cheaper than Canada or Europe.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:50.000]   So 1,300 times $3 and 20 cents comes out to be $4,160 in fuel costs.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.320]   Obviously we're ignoring motor oil.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.960]   We're ignoring tire wear and tear.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.320]   This is just simply fuel.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.240]   $4,160 of fuel.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.200]   Now, if my wife and I were traveling or perhaps even with our children, and if we
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.760]   could travel in a fuel efficient car, let's go to the best example.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.720]   We drive a Prius.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   I could comfortably travel the United States and I have in a Prius.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.160]   And the wonderful thing about that is you, if you're slowed down and you're not
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.640]   knowing 75, you could do 65 or seven, you can get 50 miles a gallon on the
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.520]   highway in a modern Prius.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.400]   Let's just use that.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.040]   13,000 miles divided by 50 miles per gallon comes out to a total fuel of only
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:34.160]   fuel cost of only 260 gallons instead of 1,300 gallons for the diesel pickup truck.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:40.480]   260 gallons of regular unleaded, which would be, let's just say $2 and 35 cents
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.160]   on a national average right now, instead of $3 and 20 cents for diesel fuel comes
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:52.520]   out to $611 of fuel for the same 13,000 miles of driving.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.960]   Remember driving the diesel pickup truck, dragging a trailer, getting 10 miles per
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:02.240]   gallon because you're dragging a big trailer is $4,160 of diesel fuel.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   Whereas the Prius is $611 of gasoline.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:16.120]   Well, run the difference between 4,160 and 611 and you wind up with $3,549 of
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.000]   savings that's available to you.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.440]   $3,549 of fuel savings by you're not driving a big truck with a big trailer.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.360]   If we divide that into the same five month time period that we were traveling,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.400]   divide that into 150 nights, 30 days per month times five months, just
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.960]   assume you're 150 night trip.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.440]   Then even in that situation, you have an extra $23 and a half per day.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.760]   Let's call it $24 per day.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.040]   That's available to you.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.200]   If you're not driving a big RV.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:57.760]   10 miles per gallon in RV is a good planning perspective to use.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.160]   If you're buying a larger class A or large car class C, you're
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.360]   going to get closer to eight.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.800]   Some of the big, big ones, you're going to get six or seven.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.240]   If you're depending on how fast you're going.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.080]   So somewhere between six and 10 is a good thing to choose.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:17.080]   There are nice RVs, generally smaller, a class B, a van camper, especially
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.040]   one with a modern diesel engine that you can get closer to 15 or 16 or sometimes
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.240]   18, but in that general, you're going to be spending in excess of a
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.800]   hundred thousand dollars for those rigs.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.520]   And so now you're going to be dealing with a much different price perspective.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.320]   So the point is you could add $25 a day to your daily budget by
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.840]   not dragging around a giant camper.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.480]   So if you added $25 per day, and you just said, instead of spending this
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.320]   $25 per day on simply fuel, I'm going to spend it on hotel stays.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.680]   You change the makeup of your budget.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.280]   Now I'm understating the expenses of traveling around with an RV and I'm, I'm
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.920]   specifically ignoring so far RV systems maintenance, all I'm saying is fuel.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.480]   That ignores the fact that a diesel pickup truck will usually use somewhere
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.000]   between 12 and 15 quarts of oil.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.400]   If you have a more modern one, you can make it five or 6,000
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.720]   miles before an oil change.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.320]   Um, for my truck, it's 3000 miles.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   I'm ignoring the cost of tires.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.640]   I'm ignoring other repairs.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.920]   When you're pulling heavy stuff, you're making your vehicle work.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.840]   You're going to have more repairs on, on the systems of your vehicle than driving
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   around in a Toyota Prius or an SUV or whatever it is that you choose to drive.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.160]   So with my friend who travels as a snowbird, what they've done, they
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.520]   travel all across the country.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.480]   They just simply travel in an SUV and they bring along their bicycles.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.560]   They've got their stuff with them.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.920]   They got plenty of stuff and they stay in hotels and you can do that very comfortably.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.520]   And you should seriously consider doing that.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:04.720]   Now, if you want to travel for an extended period of time, months, and if you want
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.080]   to have your things settled with you, especially things like having children,
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.560]   my wife and I have young children.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.480]   Hotels work fine.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.360]   They can work fine to sleep in with young children.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.080]   But if you're traveling a lot of miles, it is very nice to be able to pull into a
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.040]   rest area and put them in their beds.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.680]   It is very freeing to have those facilities with you.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.440]   So consider, will you actually be traveling for an extended period of time?
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.800]   And do your personal circumstances make it such that you'd like to have your
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.920]   things packed up, put away?
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.560]   You don't want to be taking a suitcase in and out of a hotel, et cetera.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:51.240]   Don't jump too fast at saying, "Oh, I just don't want to stay in hotels."
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.640]   If you are willing to stay in hotels, there are a lot of places that you can go
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   that you will not be able to get your RV.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:05.400]   Taking your RV into downtown New York City is incredibly stressful.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.200]   Much easier for you to simply get a hotel and enjoy the city experience.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.080]   Now you can do both.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   You can leave your RV outside of the city and you can go into the
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.160]   city and get a place to stay.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.000]   The point is just consider it.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.760]   Between number one and number two, I think you'll probably have enough to be able to
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.720]   make a decision about whether an RV is right for you.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.320]   If there are hotels available in most of the places where you wish to be, and if
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.080]   you don't mind not having all your stuff set up in your living room all the time,
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.640]   give serious thought to not choosing an RV.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.440]   Give serious thought to doing vacation rentals.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.680]   Give serious thought to traveling in a car.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.440]   Give serious thought to not having an RV because you can do away with a whole lot
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.760]   of expense, a whole lot of stress, a whole lot of hassle by not having an RV.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.760]   But on the other hand, if you want to stay in places where there aren't hotels and
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.960]   you'd like to have your things around you because you're working full time on the
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.680]   road, you're traveling for six months or a year and you've got small children and
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.920]   you're working, you want to be in places where there just simply aren't hotel
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.240]   facilities and you can't imagine sleeping on the ground, an RV is a perfect tool for
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:19.840]   you to have.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.600]   Which brings me to number three.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.440]   Number three.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.040]   My number three legitimate reason to have an RV is if you'd like to have a backup
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.240]   plan, a bug out plan in case you need to move your family and maintain the
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.800]   integrity of your family unit and your life circumstances, an RV works wonderfully
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.680]   for that.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.440]   The past weeks we've seen, of course, the horror of the California wildfires, seen
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.840]   many thousands of families have their homes destroyed, had their lives disrupted.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.640]   Many people die.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.360]   When you're in a situation like that, you need a bug out plan.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.240]   You got to plan to get out.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.080]   Now, the circumstances of that fire is that the fire arose so fast, especially the
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.680]   campfire, which is one of the worst.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.440]   The fire arose so fast, there wasn't a lot of time for pre-planning.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.680]   If there's a fire coming over the hill, hopefully you've got your fire plan in
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.320]   place and you know it's a couple of days away.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.200]   Hopefully you've got everything packed up and you're ready to leave.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.600]   Well, my understanding of the campfire is that it was birthed or lit basically in
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.120]   the morning and then it spread immediately.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.440]   So there was very little time of preparation, but an RV can work well, as
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.040]   long as you're not stuck in traffic and on little roads, an RV can work well as a
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.400]   good way for you to get your family out of an area, but I don't think it's the
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.200]   best for that.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.880]   Usually you'd want to be more nimble.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.400]   Where an RV works well is if you need a backup plan for your family to live in.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.400]   I consider the most likely threat that most people will face in their life is
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.480]   economic disruption in their personal life.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.760]   That economic disruption can come in the form of a simple job loss for an
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.640]   individual person.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.880]   That economic disruption can come in the form of a collapsing local economy.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.600]   Think Detroit, Michigan.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.360]   That economic disruption can come in the form of a regional calamity.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   Think Hurricane Katrina devastating the Gulf Coast.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.120]   That economic disruption could come in terms of a regional or national economic
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.320]   crisis of some kind.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.920]   Think Argentina.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.720]   Think Venezuela.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.640]   Think Egypt after the Arab Spring.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.920]   These types of regional crises that a family can face.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.240]   So whether it's on a small scale or a larger scale, the most important thing to
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.040]   have in that circumstance is the ability to leave the place where things are bad
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.480]   and go to a place where things are better.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.600]   Again, the best solution for you to keep your family unit intact in those
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.760]   circumstances is to leave the place where things are bad and go to a place where
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.520]   things are better.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.800]   Now, most short-term disasters, wildfire, hurricane, et cetera, most short-term
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.520]   things don't necessarily destroy a local economy.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.880]   And so most people can just simply load up their car, go a few hundred miles away,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   stay in a hotel for a few days.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.280]   Once the floodwaters of Houston recede, you can go back to Houston to shovel out
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.600]   your house and rebuild your life.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.360]   But there are problems that are so widespread and that attack a region where
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.880]   coming back, at least in the short term, is just not, doesn't work.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.080]   That can happen because your profession is no longer needed.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.280]   You're a coal miner in West Virginia.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.320]   Well, you should leave.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.600]   Or you build cars in Detroit, you should leave.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.320]   Or you live in Flint, Michigan and the waters, leave.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   So whether that's a regional thing or whether it's a regional thing that just
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.280]   simply just so devastates the infrastructure, again, New Orleans, where
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.640]   thousands of people leave and are never coming back.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   So in those circumstances, you want the ability to pack up your family and go
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.720]   from where things are bad to where things are better.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.080]   In a country like the United States, where you have such massive borders and you have
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.360]   such economic diversity across the country, one of your best ways to do that is just
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.600]   simply go to a different state.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.400]   An RV works very well as a backup plan in that kind of scenario.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.640]   This is one of the concepts that I was curious about prior to going on the road
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.600]   that I wanted to prove and see what's it actually like.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.120]   But if you buy the right kind of RV, ours is a bunkhouse model.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.240]   We have bunks for all of our children to close the door.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.320]   Even though it's small, you can have all your things.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.400]   You can have self-contained systems and you can move in comfort from
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.560]   one place to another place.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.920]   And by having your own roof over your head, you can often go to a place where
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.840]   the jobs are good, but the housing market is tight.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.800]   Think North Dakota and the oil boom.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.440]   There was no housing anywhere.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.480]   So if you could provide your own housing, though, you could get a great job.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.360]   And if you have the ability to put your own roof over your head, you can slide in.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.600]   If you're in an economic disaster, you've run out of money, you've been
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.080]   foreclosed out of your house, you've had to leave, you dropped the keys on the
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.240]   front door and you've just said, we're going to pack it.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.120]   We have a garage sale for all of our furniture.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   We load up the RV.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.800]   We're going to move from Georgia to Kansas and we're going to start fresh.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.440]   But we're going to go where the jobs are good.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.840]   We're going to go where the economy is good.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.040]   Well, in an RV, you can relatively easily find a place to park it.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   You can rent somebody's driveway from them for a few hundred dollars a month.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   You can stay in a campground.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.040]   You can stay in an RV park and you can reset your life.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.120]   You can have low expenses to keep a roof over your family's head and reasonable
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.360]   comfort while you then save up the money that you need for a first, first month,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.960]   last month in security deposit on a rental house, or you can save up money
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.360]   to buy a place, et cetera.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.320]   So it can be a good economic transition plan.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.280]   I know most people don't probably don't think about that, but fatherhood
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.400]   has changed me in that regard.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.720]   When I was single, I was incredibly flexible.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   And if you're a single person, you don't need a big RV as a backup plan.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.400]   You can go live in one if you want to, but you can sleep in your car.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   You can crash on a friend's couch, et cetera.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:20.560]   Uh, but being the father of many young children and having all of the
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.680]   associated responsibilities, it would be a little bit hard for me and my family
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.040]   to say to people, even well-meaning, nice people, Hey, listen, can we
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.600]   come and stay on your couch?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.800]   We would basically take over and completely disrupt their household.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.560]   But it's a lot easier for me to say to somebody, Hey, listen, can we park in
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.200]   your backyard or can we park in your back acreage for a couple of months
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.280]   while we transition, we're having some troubles and we're trying to get started.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   And so being a father who, who has the responsibility to provide for many
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.000]   helpless people, it's changed the appreciation that I have for being able
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   to do that.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.680]   And when you look at economic disruption that people face, when they lose their
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.480]   job, lose their house, have a medical emergency, et cetera, if you can keep
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.120]   your family together and you're not dispersed, you're not, you know, if I
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   had to send my wife to her parents and so-and-so is taking care of the kids
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.000]   and I'm off working in another country, this does not do well for family life.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.240]   I've worked with so many people who've been in that situation.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.920]   You know, they go to another country to work.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.680]   It doesn't do well.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.800]   I'm not doing it.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.120]   I'm taking my family with me.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.400]   And an RV is a great way to do that.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.880]   Especially if you live in a large country like the United States or, or, or
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.440]   many places, if you live in the European union, where you can travel among many
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.200]   different countries, if you live in a place where you can move substantially
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.360]   change your geography, the RV is a good backup plan.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.720]   Now, the cool thing about it, if you put those three things together, if you, all
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.080]   three of them apply to you, I think you can be totally happy and satisfied with
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:47.960]   the purchase of an RV.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.480]   If you enjoy staying in the places where there are no hotels, you love to go out
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.960]   and, and, and travel up a forest service road and stay at a little forest service
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   campground for free at the top of a mountain.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.840]   There's no hotels out there.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:06.520]   If you enjoy being out there for a week and you like to be able to stay out there
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.880]   and sleep well and have your family together and watch your kids play in the
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.440]   woods and, and, and ride your four wheelers and do all that kind of thing.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.800]   And if you like the idea of having a backup plan, in case your house gets burned
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   down or blown down, well, in that situation, then the RV is a wonderful thing to have.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.360]   And you can buy one relatively inexpensively.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.880]   You can keep one with relatively little hassle, and it'd be
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.240]   a tremendous benefit for you.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.080]   You'll be happy because when all three of those things are together, you'll
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.240]   be so satisfied with the RV purchase.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:45.840]   I love the RV purchase that we made because it has allowed us to comfortably
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.880]   stay where there are no hotels, to enjoy some really peak experiences that I
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.480]   never could have enjoyed if we were stuck to staying where we could purchase
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.160]   accommodation, it's allowed us to travel for a very extended period of time.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.800]   And to have all of our things settled.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.080]   And I love having that backup plan as a way for my place for my family to live
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.560]   that's mobile, that we could move our entire household from one region of the
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.640]   country to another region of the country.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.600]   If we needed to.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:21.840]   If those three things are together, you can make a very, very satisfying RV purchase.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.040]   But on the other hand, I think that if those three things are questionable,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.120]   you're probably not going to be happy buying an RV.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:34.280]   First, if you're just going to travel places where there are hotels, don't get an RV.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:38.360]   If you're going to travel places where there's lots of lodging options
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.120]   available, don't get an RV.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.080]   If you're going to travel for short periods of time, two week family vacation,
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.600]   you're thinking that an RV is going to be a great solution for you.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.280]   I don't think it is because what happens, you spend just as much time in that
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   circumstance, you spend just as much time loading up your pack, more time loading
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.080]   up and preparing your RV for a two week trip, getting all the stuff out of your
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.280]   house, putting it in the RV.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.680]   And then when you get home two weeks later, you got to get all the stuff out,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.320]   put it away.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.120]   It's very stressful because you don't know what you need.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.080]   You're not leaving the RV packed all the time.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.400]   It's just a lot of hassle.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.720]   Better off for you just to say, we're going to just throw some clothes in the bag.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.040]   And go, we're going to eat out.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.160]   We're going to stay at a hotel.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.960]   It's going to be great.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.520]   You'll have less stress than you will dealing with an RV.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.960]   If you're only going for a short period of time, my wife and I found this when we
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.680]   had wonderful invitations from people to stay in places, but just even though we
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.080]   could take the RV to a, um, somebody's house and they said here, stay in the
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.400]   house and we enjoyed staying in the house.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.520]   It was so much work for us to unload the RV, figure out what we needed in the
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.640]   house, the clothes, the toys, the food, you know, the, the, the equipment to take
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.120]   it all in the house, set up in the house for however long we're going to be there.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.280]   A few days, few weeks.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.560]   And then at the end of it, to clean up the house and put all the
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.400]   stuff back in every RV, we came to the point where we just rather just stay in
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.480]   the RV and the same thing applies in that vacation standpoint, you spend days
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.960]   preparing and then a few days on the trip and then days cleaning up.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:08.320]   And then finally, if you don't care about having a backup plan or a bug out plan,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.120]   or if your bug out plan involves you traveling to a different country on an
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.960]   airplane or jumping on your boat or something like that, many situations
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.080]   in RV wouldn't actually work.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.640]   Again, if I were fleeing from a fire, if it's coming in, you want to be in a nimble
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   car, you don't want to be dragging around a giant trailer.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.560]   So those are the kinds of things that, that if those don't apply to you, I
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.680]   recommend you stay away from an RV.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.760]   Now, can you live cheaply in an RV?
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.480]   Yes, you can.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.560]   Can you do it cheap?
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.040]   Yes.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.080]   There are people who use RVs to massive economic benefit.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.880]   I always enjoy seeing the people who, they love to go and snow ski country.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.040]   And they just take their RV and every weekend they go and stay in the parking
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.800]   lot of the ski lodge and then hit the fresh powder on Saturday morning.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.920]   The reason you can do that most of the time is because many ski resorts are
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.200]   leased or placed on national forest land.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.160]   And so the technically the parking lot is national forest land.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.960]   So you can take your RV and you can stay in a, uh, in the, in the parking lot and
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.760]   stay there and then go and ski and you can save yourself a few hundred dollars a
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.560]   night on that hotel lodging.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.720]   And you can avoid a lot of the traffic getting out there to the slopes.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.480]   So there are many ways to do it.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.200]   And you don't have to spend a lot of money in an RV.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.720]   I met many just broke people living in an RV full time.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.560]   But if you are going to maintain a certain standard of comfort, especially
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.200]   if you're providing for others, if you're going to maintain a middle-class
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.080]   lifestyle, RVs are not cheap.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.880]   When the equipment breaks, it's expensive.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.320]   If you're a single, you can do it cheap.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:44.840]   You don't care.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.120]   You can, you can put stuff together, but if you're just going to maintain kind
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.800]   of middle-class standards, it's hard to do it cheap.
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:58.640]   Now there is, I believe an ideal solution for you.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:05.920]   If you are trying to put these three things together, but it's not a slam
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.400]   dunk for you, for example, you like to stay where there are no hotels, but
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.760]   you're not going to do it for a long period of time, or you don't want to do
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.360]   it all the time.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:18.240]   And the solution is the pop-up camper, which I will create an entirely separate
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.840]   show to try to sell you on the idea of a pop-up camper.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.160]   But here's what you should know in preparation for that show.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.080]   I grew up camping in a pop-up camper and I hated it.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.240]   And I promised myself that I would never have a pop-up camper.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.760]   I told my wife for years, how much I disliked pop-up tent campers, and I
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.160]   never wanted to have a pop-up tent camper.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.200]   Today, I would be thoroughly happy to have a pop-up tent camper.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.640]   And I'm going to recommend to you in a separate episode that your next RV or
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.360]   your only RV should be a pop-up tent camper.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.680]   And I'll explain how the pop-up tent camper satisfies all of these
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.960]   things in a really ideal way.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.160]   It gives a good balance here that I think for most people is far
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.360]   more compelling than they think.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.680]   Now it won't work for long-term travel where you're living in it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:18.240]   But for most of the ways that most US Americans own and use RVs, a pop-up tent
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.400]   camper really will be an ideal solution.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.000]   I'll save that one for a separate show.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.880]   Now as I close today's show and wrap it up, I want to take just a moment and
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.400]   talk to you about one of the biggest questions that people ask about
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.840]   while traveling is health care.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.920]   How do you obtain for yourself appropriate health care on the road?
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.880]   And I'm doing this as an ad for Samaritan Ministries, and I'll explain
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   how and why it works in a moment.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.240]   I've done many series of shows on health care sharing ministries.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.720]   If you're unfamiliar with them, a health care sharing ministry is a
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.360]   religious organization and/or an ideological organization, which
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.600]   specifically involves the ability of members of that organization to share
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.400]   their expenses with one another.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.920]   These organizations are not health insurance.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.440]   There is no legal contract between you and a health insurance company, but they
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.760]   do function in some way similar to health insurance, whereas you incur medical
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:22.920]   expenses, those medical expenses can, may, probably will be, legally or not
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.240]   guaranteed to be, but probably will be paid for and shared among your fellow
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:27.640]   members.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.880]   There are a variety of these out there.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.080]   I've done shows on a number of them, and they range from, and the reason I point
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.920]   out religious ideology and ideology being important is there has to be an
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.640]   ideological component to them.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.360]   Most of these are Christian organizations, although the brand of Christianity will
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.720]   vary depending on the company.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:55.360]   So you'll have a very kind of loose, general things like liberty, what they
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:59.680]   call liberty health sharing, where we affirm that God is about liberty kind of
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:04.400]   thing, just this very vague theological convictions to the one that my family and
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.640]   I use, which is called Samaritan Ministries, which is extremely
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.520]   conservative, Trinitarian, Protestant doctrine, et cetera.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.640]   Though I think you can join if you're not Protestant as well, if you're Orthodox
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.120]   or Catholic.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:20.000]   So the point is that these organizations really work wonderfully.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.400]   And when traveling, one of the things that I have most enjoyed about a healthcare
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   sharing ministry is it works the way that health things should work.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.960]   In this way, when my wife and I, if we need to consult a doctor or a care
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.920]   provider or something like that, we just simply go and choose one.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:43.080]   And as we've traveled across the country, it's been easy for us to choose one
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:48.400]   anywhere of any brand or any variety that's worked for us.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.880]   And then when we're done with that medical service, we just
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.240]   simply pay the medical provider.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.120]   Just take $20 bills or a hundred dollar bills, the case may be out of my wallet,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.920]   and I pay them for their service.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.640]   And in that payment, I'm able to get a very reasonable price.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.320]   I understand that healthcare generally costs a lot, but when you start pulling
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.360]   physical paper money out of your pocket, you can get a lot of health providers to
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.320]   do a lot of things for a lot cheaper price.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:22.400]   And then when we're done with it, whenever we're done with that event, I
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.160]   just take those bills, I submit them to Samaritan Ministries for reimbursement.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.840]   They share it and I get checks in the mail.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.840]   And it is wonderful.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.600]   I don't have to worry about networks.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.800]   I don't have to worry about preferred providers.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.040]   I don't have to worry about any of those things.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.880]   I just simply go, get service, pay for it, and then later am reimbursed.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:49.000]   Healthcare sharing is a wonderful solution.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.960]   It's not perfect.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.600]   Go back and listen to the long series of shows that I have done on it.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.000]   It has disadvantages.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.240]   It's not for everyone.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.080]   It's certainly not for everyone.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:01.560]   If you can't find a company that will be, that you can affirm their ideological
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.960]   statements or statement of faith.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:08.040]   If you can't find a company that, that has the coverage that you need or your
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   concerned about extreme scenarios, then it's not for everyone.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   You need to be very, very careful.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.840]   But if you're looking for a healthcare solution, health, something that works
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   similar to health insurance, if you're looking for a solution, at least check
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.320]   out the Healthcare Sharing Ministries.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.440]   Cause I'll tell you, as we have traveled, we have loved our
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.840]   experience with Samaritan Ministries.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.400]   Go and check it out on Samaritan Ministries website.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.360]   Go and check it out the past episodes of the show.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.760]   If you find that Samaritan Ministries specifically or Healthcare Sharing
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.520]   Ministry in general is helpful for you, if you wind up signing up, just let
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.440]   them know that Joshua Sheets sent you.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.480]   Now specifically, let me explain.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.360]   Samaritan Ministries doesn't pay me money to advertise for them, but they do
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:58.320]   have a referral program where if you refer clients to them, they discount your next
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.600]   bill, and so from time to time I have listeners of the show who will sign up
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.240]   for Samaritan Ministries, and every time that a listener of the show signs up,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.840]   then my next month's bill is discounted.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.120]   Usually my bill is about $500 a month based upon the plan that we're
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.560]   on for my family and our needs.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.720]   But then sometimes it comes in and it's 300, sometimes it comes in and it's $100
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.400]   a month because listeners sign up, and when you're signing up for Samaritan
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.000]   Ministries, you mention to them, "Hey, Joshua Sheets sent me."
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.280]   They say, "Look me up," and then they discount my bill.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.240]   Here's the cool thing.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.840]   That's also available to you.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.280]   So I'm not using any super special podcast advertising program.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.720]   They're not paying me money for this ad I'm doing for them right now.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:38.640]   I'm just doing it to lower my monthly expense because if you sign up,
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.320]   then I get a discount.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:45.680]   I think it's $100 or $150 that discounts my bill when any one of you sign up.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.120]   But then you can do the same thing.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.880]   So after you sign up, if one of your friends signs up, they mention your name
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.640]   and you can have access to the same program.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.400]   That's of course very helpful to you and to me, which is why I do
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.520]   these ads from time to time.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.720]   Go and check out Healthcare Sharing Ministries.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.760]   Do your research.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.800]   They might be right for you.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.480]   At some point, I intend to create an entire course on Healthcare Sharing
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.040]   Ministries that'll answer your questions.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.160]   I'll sell it to you just so that you can understand the pros and cons,
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.120]   how they work, et cetera.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.320]   They're not for everyone, but go and check out the different options.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.920]   Did a series of shows and check out Samaritan Ministries.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:24.120]   If you can affirm their statements of faith and et cetera, their very kind
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.480]   of strict rules, if you can affirm the things that are excluded from care,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.720]   very important that you understand what those things are.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.200]   The things that Samaritan Ministries excludes from care are
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.600]   very offensive to some people.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.760]   They're very welcome to other people.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.080]   So you read those things carefully, but if you find that they're right,
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.320]   that it's a good solution for your family, just let them know Joshua
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.520]   Sheets sent you and my future lower to non-existent bill will thank you.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.280]   Or at least I'll thank you when I receive that bill.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.240]   Be back with you very soon.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.960]   Thank you for listening.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.240]   With Kroger brand products from Ralph's, you can make all your favorite
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.280]   things this holiday season because Kroger brands proven quality products
