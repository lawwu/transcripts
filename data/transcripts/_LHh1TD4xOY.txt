[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   All right, let's move on.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.680]   We got another A name here.
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.120]   Anna.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840]   Anna asks, which focus principles for deep work
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.400]   can I automate at scale?
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.720]   I have 100,000 or more employees that I manage or work with.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.440]   Oh, I work with internal productivity tools
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.920]   at a large tech company with over 100,000 employees.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.680]   For highest impact with the least friction,
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.600]   which principles for deep work should I
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.480]   build into our internal tools that
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920]   need to be adopted at scale?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.960]   Which principles should I advocate for at a cultural
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.720]   level with leadership?
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.200]   So Anna, you work on productivity for a tech company
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.400]   with 100,000 or more employees.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.560]   Advice number one, if this company is Facebook,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.800]   don't tell-- don't advocate the leadership
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   that these principles came from me.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.960]   I don't think that's going to help your cause.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.840]   In fact, don't mention deep work,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.600]   I would say, if you're at Facebook.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720]   Again, this is a place where dropping my name
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.960]   is probably not going to be your--
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.520]   probably be your best strategy.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.160]   But here's my general answer for you.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.560]   It's let's stop thinking about tools for now.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440]   I think this is a common techno-solutionism framework
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.040]   that people have in tech, which is the right tool will engender
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.640]   the right way of working.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.520]   You improve work by introducing better tools.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.320]   I think that gets it backwards.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.280]   I think if you go back, let's say, to the River--
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.160]   the Rouge River Henry Ford plant in 1910, pre-assembly line.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.280]   And you look at this thing, and you're standing there
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.080]   with Henry, and you say, how are we
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.520]   going to make this more productive?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.880]   How are we going to produce more cars
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.840]   with the same amount of resources?
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.320]   His answer would not have been, we need a better tool.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.880]   We need a better car-building tool.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.440]   And if someone invents a better car-building tool,
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.480]   then we are going to be able to build cars faster.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.440]   That's not what he did.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.920]   Instead, he invented a whole new process
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.560]   for producing cars, a process based on the continual motion
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.400]   assembly line.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Now, the actual tools required to implement this, most of them
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   were things that already existed.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120]   He deployed existing technologies to implement it.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.640]   And in some cases, he had to invent custom tools,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.400]   where they did not exist, but the tools came second.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.640]   So one of the things he invented was this surrounding drill
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.600]   press that could drill--
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.440]   I forget what the count was--
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   something like 18 different holes at the same time
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.880]   into an engine block.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.480]   So the engine block would come to a station on the assembly
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.280]   line, and this thing would come around it and drill 18
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.360]   precision holes simultaneously.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.800]   They had to invent that.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.440]   That did not exist.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.000]   And there would be no reason for that to exist before the assembly
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.520]   line, because what's the rush?
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.440]   It's going to take us three days to build this car.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.800]   I can drill the holes as I need them.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960]   But if you're on a continuous motion assembly line,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   we've got 30 seconds to drill these holes.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.680]   But the point is, they invented that thing
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   because they needed it after they came up
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   with the new process.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.280]   It was not like Henry Ford was sitting around saying,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.400]   man, how can we produce cars faster?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.840]   And then one of his engineers came in and was like, Henry,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080]   I just invented a machine that can drill 18 holes
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.760]   simultaneously into the engine block.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.480]   He's like, oh, man, with this tool,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.940]   we will now build an assembly line.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.600]   It came second.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   And that's what I think needs to happen in knowledge work.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.480]   You need better processes for how the standard work that
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000]   happens on a regular basis gets done.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.640]   Once you have those processes, then you
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.280]   can ask the question, what tools do we need
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.440]   to implement this new process?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.040]   Now, how do you design these processes?
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.520]   Well, the idea I talk about in my most recent book,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.160]   A World Without Email, is that the main thing
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.720]   you want to avoid in knowledge work is context shifts.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.080]   The more people have to shift their cognitive context
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   from one point of focus to another,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160]   the more attention residue you're creating,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.800]   which means the more you're lowering
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.320]   their cognitive capacity, the more
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   you're creating this frustrating cognitive friction,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.320]   and the quicker you're going to burn people out.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   They're going to produce worse work slower and get burnt out.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.040]   The optimal way to work is on one thing at a time
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.280]   until you reach a stopping point with a generous buffer
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.000]   to transition to the next thing.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.760]   So when you're thinking about processes
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   to make people more productive, what you really
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.960]   should be thinking about is processes
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.080]   to reduce context shifting.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.320]   And so how do you measure that?
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.080]   Well, I argue in A World Without Email
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.440]   that the most convenient proxy for context shifts--
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.400]   if you say, here's our new way for collaborating
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.480]   on producing a report.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.080]   Here's our new process for producing a new code feature.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.480]   The best proxy for measuring how much context shifting
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.280]   is this process going to create is to instead
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.000]   ask the related question, on average,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.560]   how many unscheduled messages am I
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.240]   going to have to see and reply to in order
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.400]   to complete this objective?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   Whether they're coming in email, whether they're coming on Slack,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   whether they're coming on Teams, how many unscheduled messages
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.920]   will I have to see and respond to as part of actually
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   finishing this objective?
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.800]   Now, the reason why that's the best proxy for context shifting
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   is this is the major source of context shifts
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.340]   in modern knowledge work, is the need
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.080]   to monitor ongoing back and forth conversations happening
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.640]   in email, happening in Slack, happening in Teams.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.080]   We have asynchronous back and forth conversation happening
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.720]   that requires you to see messages that
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.360]   are going to come at unpredictable times
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.220]   and need a response.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.200]   This requires you to check inboxes and channels
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.040]   all the time.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.120]   Those checks generate most of the context shifts
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.080]   that are destroying us, cognitively speaking,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.920]   as knowledge workers.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.240]   So if you want to compare process A to process B
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.600]   for the same objective, say which
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.000]   one is going to require less unscheduled messages that
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.240]   need a response?
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.700]   And so maybe you say, you know what,
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.880]   instead of just rock and rolling on email
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.720]   and going back and forth to gather feedback
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.800]   to finish this report, we're going
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.240]   to set up a process where we have a shared folder where
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.640]   the report goes in on Monday.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.600]   And everyone's feedback has to go into this Google Doc
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.080]   by Wednesday, close of business.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.760]   Thursday, I write the first draft.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.360]   Friday morning, it is open for people to look at.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.160]   I have office hours Friday afternoon.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   You come to my office hours if you have any questions.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.160]   I always have a half hour right after those office hours
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   to polish the document with people's feedback.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.280]   The designer knows whatever they see in that Dropbox folder
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.200]   at the end of Friday, they can format and post.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.520]   That is a process that requires no unscheduled messages that
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   need to be responded to.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   And so that would be better than another process
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.280]   where you say, let's not get weighed down with this, guys.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.960]   Just hit me up on Slack when it's ready.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   And we'll go back and forth.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.920]   I can ask you questions if I have questions.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.340]   And I'll let the designer know via email when it's ready.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.680]   That would be easier, but who cares about easy?
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.360]   The assembly line was a huge pain.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.000]   That wasn't easy.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.800]   But it produced cars to NextFaster.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.680]   Same thing with this.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.040]   That scenario A requires less unscheduled messages.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.680]   So it's a pain.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.320]   Who cares?
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.440]   That's less context shifting.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.200]   That's better.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.560]   So that's how I think about designing better processes
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.000]   in knowledge work.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.920]   It's all about reducing context shifts.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.200]   Unscheduled messages is a great proxy for that metric.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.240]   So Anna, that's what needs to happen.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.740]   Here are the things we do again and again in the various teams
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.760]   at our company.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.800]   How can we work with each team and from the ground
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.640]   up create agreed upon processes for each of these things
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.560]   that minimizes this unscheduled messages that need answering?
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.720]   Then you can say, what tools do we
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.040]   need to support these processes?
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   And I'll tell you what.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.140]   90% of the time, it's going to be
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.280]   some combination of Google Docs and email
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.680]   and maybe Dropbox.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's not going to be some fancy tool.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.520]   Maybe you'll have a Trello in there every once in a while.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.800]   5% of the time, maybe you need some more fancy tool.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.040]   You have to develop something from scratch.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.160]   But that's like, we'll get there when we get there.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.280]   And most of the tools we need exist.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.680]   Most of the technology existed to build the assembly line.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.600]   It was just a matter of thinking,
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.320]   this is how we're going to organize work.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.120]   The same has to happen with knowledge work.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.080]   So let's stop obsessing about tools.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.640]   Let's not let tools be the tail that
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.440]   wags the knowledge work dog.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.120]   Fix the processes that make sense for our brain.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.080]   And then and only then ask, what tech do we need
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.720]   to actually implement them?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.840]   There we go.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.120]   I read more about Henry Ford and the assembly line
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.840]   than anyone mad needs to.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.880]   I was researching a world without email.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.720]   For whatever reason, I just went down that rabbit hole.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.920]   I'm not surprised because you bring it up a lot.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.040]   So you can just tell it's in the back of your mind.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   It's taking up a lot of space in there.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.640]   To be quite honest though, it's kind of cool
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   because I have a few friends who are coaches.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.680]   And they always talk about how players at all levels
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.880]   need to be constantly coached.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.680]   And I hear your explanation about it all the time.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.480]   I pick up more and more about how
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.600]   you're bringing it together.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.160]   Yeah, you got to come back to it.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.960]   And you come back to things from different angles.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.600]   And I clarify them.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's kind of one of the cool things about this show
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.440]   is if you listen to it for a while,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.960]   you can see my thoughts refining on topics.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.200]   Because we come back at it from different angles again
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.920]   and I start to refine and sand off the rough edges
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.280]   and find the consistent themes.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.400]   And it's thinking shown live, real time.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.980]   (upbeat music)
