[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - This week we're talking with Pastor John
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.660]   about book reading.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.840]   On Monday we looked at the seven ways
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.200]   books have impacted your life, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.800]   And there you gave us a brief theology of reading as well,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.160]   looking at that incredible text in Ephesians 3, 4.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.440]   And as you were talking about all the ways,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   those seven ways that books have changed your life,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.040]   I could hear you very eager
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.800]   to give specific recommendations.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.640]   So let's do the who today.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.240]   Who do you read?
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.200]   That's today's question from a listener named Sam.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.680]   Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.200]   In a recent Solid Joys devotional I listened to,
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.440]   Pastor John, you mentioned the practice
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.640]   of reading rich doctrinal books.
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.620]   That's the quote, rich doctrinal books.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920]   What would you consider to be your top 10
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.600]   rich doctrinal books that have helped you grow
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.040]   over the decades?
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.680]   - Well, I have an awful time answering top questions
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.620]   or most questions,
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.000]   but I can't answer 10 rich doctrinal books
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080]   that have made a walloping impact on my life.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.240]   Whether I leave one out that's in the top 10,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120]   my memory's not good enough to say.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.340]   Here's what C.S. Lewis said about our longing
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.340]   for the heart, our hearts, to sing with joy
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.800]   over what we see about God in our devotions.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.480]   He said, "For my own part,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.820]   I tend to find the doctrinal books often more helpful
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.100]   in devotion than devotional books,
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.660]   and I rather suspect that the same experience
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.620]   awaits others.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.620]   I believe that many who find, quote, nothing happens
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.580]   when they sit down or kneel down to a book of devotion
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.900]   would find that the heart sings unbidden
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.500]   when they are working their way
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.020]   through a tough bit of theology
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.280]   with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand."
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.320]   So my response to that is,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.180]   "Well, you can leave the pipe aside."
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.460]   (laughing)
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.940]   You can get mouth cancer on your way to devotions.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.940]   Leave the pipe aside, but do pick up the pencil
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.940]   and a doctrinally rich book and see what happens."
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.940]   So here are 10 authors who have done this for me,
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.940]   made my heart sing because of what they showed me
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.300]   of God and his ways from the Bible.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.260]   Number one, Jonathan Edwards.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.420]   No historic theologian has shaped me more.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.820]   I mentioned four books,
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.140]   "The End For Which God Created the World,"
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.620]   "The Religious Affections,"
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.700]   "The Essay on the Trinity," and "Freedom of the Will."
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.500]   One of those showed me the nature of God as three in one.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.340]   Another showed me the goal of God
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.620]   to glorify himself in all that he does.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.500]   Another showed me that my affections are essential
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.580]   to the worship and obedience of God,
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.460]   and the fourth showed me the compatibility
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.220]   between God's absolute sovereignty
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.580]   and my human accountability before him.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.740]   Number two, John Owen.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.100]   "The Mortification of Sin,"
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.980]   that book, that little book, 80, 90 pages,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.460]   takes us into the depths of how God
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.820]   overcomes sin in our lives,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.620]   and on communion with God shows us
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.940]   what it means actually to have fellowship
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.340]   with each member of the Trinity,
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.020]   and the death of death in the death of Christ
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.220]   clarifies the glory of particular redemption,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.500]   namely that Christ really did secure
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.900]   the new covenant blessings for God's elect.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.140]   Number three, Stephen Charnock,
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.380]   "The Existence and Attributes of God."
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.340]   Of course, we just put out a brand new
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.540]   double-volume edition of this.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.540]   That book, that giant 1500-page in two volumes
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.300]   sat on my bedside table for, my guess is,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.180]   I can't remember exactly, a couple of years?
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.020]   It sat on my bedside table,
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.980]   and I soaked with just two or three pages
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860]   at night before I went to bed.
[00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.340]   I soaked in God's holiness, his eternity,
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.580]   his immutability, his patience, his goodness.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.580]   Someone asked Bernard of Clairvaux in the Middle Ages,
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.260]   "Why don't people love God more?"
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.100]   And he said, "Because they don't know him."
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.940]   Charnock is a great remedy for that ailment.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.780]   Number four, if you don't want to start
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.180]   with a two-volume, 1500-page book,
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.500]   then start with J.I. Packer, "Knowing God."
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.740]   250 pages instead of 1500,
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.980]   and the first sentence goes like this,
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.500]   "As clowns yearn to play Hamlet,
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.100]   so I have wanted to write a treatise on God."
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.420]   (laughs)
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.060]   Packer knows God is infinite and he's finite.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.300]   The chasm between him and God is wider than the universe.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.940]   So Packer is a good, humble guide.
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.380]   He's not presumptuous, but he is profound
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.060]   in his own special, accessible way.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.180]   So start with Packer if Charnock sounds daunting.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.300]   John Murray, "Redemption Accomplished and Applied."
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.620]   I learned my Calvinism not from Calvin,
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.260]   but mainly from Romans and Ephesians and Philippians
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.980]   and the Gospel of John.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.540]   But at certain points along the way
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.860]   in my theological pilgrimage,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.580]   a book would come along that put so many pieces together
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.180]   in a beautiful, coherent way
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.340]   that I found them extremely helpful.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.660]   The very title, "Redemption," colon,
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.820]   "Accomplished and Applied,"
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.060]   still functions for me like a bright light.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.460]   God accomplished my redemption on the cross,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.180]   once for all, decisively.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.420]   It's over, it's done, it's finished, it's accomplished.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.420]   Propitiation, redemption, and then He sovereignly,
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.140]   at age six, He applies that to my life.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.500]   Justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.460]   by giving me faith, bringing me to Himself.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.880]   So after Packer, go to Murray.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.060]   Number six, John Bunyan, "Pilgrim's Progress."
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.900]   You might not think that this interesting story
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.820]   that children can enjoy, a fascinating allegory,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.460]   is doctrinally rich, but it is.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.740]   One of the things about an allegory
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.820]   is that you can read it at different levels.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.540]   It's just an interesting story with monsters and dangers,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.980]   or at the profound level of how the Christian life
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.900]   really works under the sovereignty of God.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.260]   Number seven, J.C. Ryle, "Holiness."
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.540]   One of the great strengths of this book
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.540]   that makes it so doctrinally rich
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.240]   is that he keeps in clear view the difference
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.540]   between justification and sanctification,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.180]   and how they relate to each other
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.500]   in the quest for holiness.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.440]   It also has the hidden benefit of being 150 years old,
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.940]   so that we can see,
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.740]   I was just glancing at my notes yesterday,
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.860]   we can see how some of the challenges
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.820]   to holiness that we face, we think are new,
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   really not new or peculiar to our age.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.100]   Number eight, D.A. Carson,
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.720]   "The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God."
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.180]   This is only 84 pages, but it goes a long way
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.980]   to keep us from talking in sentimental nonsense
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.640]   about the love of God.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.460]   Almost everybody in the post-Christian West
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.020]   thinks of God as more or less lenient and kind.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.340]   They bring their conceptions to the Bible,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.900]   and when the Bible says, "God is love,"
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.180]   they fill it up with meaning
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.880]   that they already had in their head,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.900]   which may be completely wrong.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   And Don Carson helps us see what God is really like
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.140]   in what he revealed about his love.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.560]   Number nine, Martin Lloyd-Jones, "The Sermon on the Mount."
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.520]   This two-volume collection of sermons
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.900]   on Jesus' most famous sermon opened my eyes
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.900]   in the summer of 1968 to how doctrinal preaching
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.560]   could set the heart on fire.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.840]   When I read it, I was 22 years old,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:52.500]   and I thought, "That's how I'd like to pray someday."
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   Number 10, George Ladd, "A Theology of the New Testament
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.120]   and the Presence of the Future."
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.260]   Dr. Ladd was my New Testament prof in seminary
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.180]   and introduced a whole generation of American evangelicals
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.160]   to the fact that the New Testament
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.420]   is eschatological cover to cover,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.420]   meaning that Israel's long-awaited kingdom of God
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.760]   has already arrived and yet is not entirely here.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.500]   He showed us that the, quote, "mystery of the kingdom,"
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.700]   that you read about in the gospels,
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.140]   the mystery of the kingdom
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.540]   is fulfillment without consummation.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.740]   That's the mystery.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.860]   The kingdom of God is already here in some senses,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.580]   and it is not yet here in other senses.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.880]   And the tension between the already of the kingdom
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.960]   and the not yet of the kingdom
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.460]   affects everything in the Bible, everything in life.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.460]   So eschatology is not just a final chapter about end times
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.440]   in the systematic theology textbook,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.840]   but a pervasive reality touching everything
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.520]   in the New Testament and in life.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.400]   Those are my 10 suggested authors
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.080]   and some of their doctrinally rich books.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.920]   Remember, as you read, to be like B.B. Warfield.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   When he was criticized that 10 minutes on your knees
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.080]   would give you a truer, deeper, more operative knowledge
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.920]   of God than 10 hours over your books, he replied, "What?
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.040]   Then 10 hours over your books on your knees?"
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.280]   Even if you read these books in your chair,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   not on your knees, even if you're sitting in your chair,
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.640]   be kneeling in your heart,
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.020]   and then the rich doctrine will make the heart sing.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.720]   - Great list of book ideas, perfectly timed.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.400]   Pastor John, because for those of us in the States,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.160]   we're coming up on a long weekend.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.400]   Monday is Labor Day for us, a long weekend,
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.000]   perfect for a little bit more extra book reading.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.160]   Monday is a holiday, a holiday for doing just about anything
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.320]   but thinking about work, really, to be honest,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.140]   but not for us.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.000]   We're back on Monday to talk about work
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.120]   and to ask if there is work in eternity in the new creation.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.440]   And if so, what vocations will there be in the new creation
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.640]   and will we be employed in something
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.160]   that corresponds to our interests in this life?
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.840]   Interesting set of questions we'll ask Pastor John on Monday.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.160]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.120]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:12:00.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
