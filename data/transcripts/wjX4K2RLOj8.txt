[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All the Hacks,"
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.680]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.520]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited you're
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.780]   here for a unique episode.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.600]   And if you're watching on video, you already know why.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.880]   It's because I'm recording from the St. Regis Bora Bora
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.560]   on an overwater bungalow.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.140]   And if you look behind me, it's absolutely amazing.
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320]   So many of the listener questions I get
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.640]   are about how to redeem your miles and points
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.280]   for amazing vacations.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.240]   So I thought I would use this episode
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.320]   to break down exactly how we ended up
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.920]   booking a trip that would have cost more than $20,000
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.360]   for less than $1,500.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   I'll walk through finding the airlines,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.400]   transferring the points, booking the hotels,
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.320]   and all the hacks you need to make a trip
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.440]   like this possible yourself.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.680]   But two quick things before we get started.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.360]   One, if you're new to travel hacking, points, and miles,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.520]   and you want to get a good foundation first,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.080]   I'd recommend going back and listening to episode one
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.480]   with Lee Rowan, episode three with Brad Barrett,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.280]   or episode 27 with the points guy Brian Kelly.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.240]   And two, if you're listening to this
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.840]   and thinking that a trip like this is out of the question,
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.460]   I'd recommend going back and listening
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.080]   to episode one with Lee Rowan, episode three with Brad Barrett,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.760]   or episode 27 with the points guy Brian Kelly.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.560]   And three, if you're listening to this
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.360]   and thinking that a trip like this is out of reach,
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.040]   I just want to read an amazing email I got from a listener
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160]   a few weeks ago.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.080]   Chris, my name is Zach.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.400]   I'm a medical student finishing up my second year
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920]   and have been a fan of your podcast
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920]   since the first episode came out.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.680]   I really like what you're doing, and I've
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   been putting a lot of these hacks to good work.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440]   As you can imagine, money is incredibly tight
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.640]   for a medical student.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.440]   I use almost exclusively points and miles
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.880]   to cover round-trip flights and four or five-star hotels
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.720]   for a 10-day trip to Europe to celebrate our four-year
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.800]   anniversary in a few months.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.920]   We ended up turning 350,000 points and miles
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.400]   from credit card sign-up bonuses and other necessary purchases
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   into flights and hotels that we calculated
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.880]   equals about $7,200 of value.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.920]   I think this is proof that what you're talking about
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.800]   works for literally anyone, even a medical student who basically
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.180]   has no money.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.600]   Thanks again for what you're doing,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.120]   and I look forward to listening to more episodes of all
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.720]   the hacks in the future.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   Zach, I'm so excited for the trip.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   I hope it's incredible.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.280]   And thank you so much for writing in.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   Hopefully, that helps anyone listening
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.160]   know that you can use all the hacks I'm
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.120]   talking about on this show to take an amazing trip yourself.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.760]   All right, let's jump in.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.320]   So first off, how did this trip even come to be?
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.960]   Well, if you've been listening, you
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.200]   might know that my wife and I are expecting our second child
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.480]   in June this year.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   So we were trying to think what kind of a vacation
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.840]   we could take before the craziness of having
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.220]   two children come.
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.600]   And my parents kindly volunteered
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.660]   to watch our daughter for one week
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.800]   and told us this week would work best.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.580]   So we started thinking about what we could possibly
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.060]   do with one week off.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.880]   And we had all these points, and we
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.960]   wanted to burn them on something amazing.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.320]   And so we started looking, and we kind of identified
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.920]   we didn't want to go too crazy far just for the fact
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.000]   that we only had a week.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.560]   So it was, where can we go on flights for less than 10 hours?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.000]   And the options, unfortunately, from the West Coast,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200]   a lot of the Caribbean is really hard to get to.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.160]   So we looked at places like Turks and Caicos.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.860]   So we even looked at Costa Rica.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.360]   And it just seemed like it was going
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.320]   to be a really tough trip to take multiple layovers to get
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.640]   to where you wanted to.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.520]   And it just wasn't that convenient.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   And we'd come to Bora Bora back in 2018,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.020]   and we stayed at the Conrad.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   And I'll talk about the differences between that
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.480]   and the St. Regis in a bit.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   But it was so amazing that we thought, well,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.920]   we might as well just look to see if that's possible.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.320]   So we kind of had an idea from the beginning of,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.840]   let's just take the most amazing, relaxing vacation
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.600]   we can.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.280]   We know Bora Bora is one nonstop flight.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.240]   It's about eight hours from San Francisco.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.280]   And then you take a small plane from Papiete
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.640]   to here, which you can probably hear flying above me right now.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.940]   And that is exactly what we thought we would do.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.420]   So that was the idea, was from the beginning,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.100]   can we make Bora Bora possible with points, with miles?
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.260]   And so we started deciding to look in
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.780]   to see if it was going to work.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.700]   And so let me jump in to some screen sharing here.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.160]   Obviously, if you have questions,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.980]   you can follow up on the video or follow up by email.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.980]   I'm always chris@allthathacks.com.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.580]   Before we get into everything, I just
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.100]   want to paint a picture of how amazing this place is.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.060]   My wife and I have been on a lot of trips.
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.460]   And we always say, next time, we're
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.700]   going to go somewhere new.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.620]   But Bora Bora and Japan are two places that we always say,
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.340]   you know what?
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.540]   Let's just go back there again, because it's so incredible.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.100]   The water is the clearest thing you could possibly imagine.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.820]   Resorts have hammocks that just sit out in the ocean,
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.180]   so you can just lie, relax, and enjoy just
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.500]   the most beautiful views.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.180]   There's something super special about having a bungalow that
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.740]   sits over the water, where you can jump off your balcony
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.300]   straight into the water.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.620]   You get bikes, and you can ride them all around.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.740]   It's the most relaxing, manicured place to just--
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.320]   everyone is so friendly.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.180]   It's hard to be more excited about a place you
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.540]   can go on vacation than here.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.100]   And one of the things I really love
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.580]   is that I've been to a few resorts,
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.740]   whether sometimes in Mexico or in the Caribbean,
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.340]   where it just feels like you took
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.100]   a bunch of American culture, and you just plopped it down
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.820]   in the middle of a nice beach.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.180]   And this is totally different than that.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.020]   French Polynesia has a very distinct culture.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.060]   And most of the resorts here try to infuse that culture
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.980]   into the resort.
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.220]   So you really get a feel for it, whether it's activities,
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.100]   excursions, doing a Polynesian night, different types of food
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.340]   that you can try.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.420]   A lot of the staff--
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.900]   the staff at most of these resorts
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.540]   is the most friendly people ever.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.960]   And you can spend time talking to them about their culture
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.740]   and understand it.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.140]   And so I think that's another part of travel
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.460]   that's really important to us that you get to do here.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.600]   I think that's it.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.300]   I just wanted to paint a picture of what
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.180]   it's really an amazing, magical experience a trip like this
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.140]   can be.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.300]   I know a lot of people say it's once in a lifetime.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.520]   But the reason I love points, the reason I love miles,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.860]   the reason I love all the hacks is because there's
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.420]   a way to make it possible way more frequently than once
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.900]   in a lifetime without having to spend the money it would
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.860]   otherwise cost.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.700]   So now that we know where we're going,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.200]   I want to start looking at how we can get there.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.980]   And then I'll look at where to stay.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.480]   So we want to go to Papeete, which
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.500]   is the main international airport in French Polynesia.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.380]   So I like to start all of these searches
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.620]   by going to flightconnections.com.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.460]   And I do that because they show you all the routes
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.300]   that you can get to a certain airport from.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.020]   So for Papeete, you can see that in the US, the only routes
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.180]   are from San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.380]   Now, for us trying to take a week trip, which
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.300]   is going to be a short trip, flying from San Francisco
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.220]   to Honolulu and then down to Papeete,
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.100]   it's just not in the cards.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.440]   So we're really looking at SFO and LAX flights.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.660]   So now that I know what the routes are,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.340]   I first like to go see how much are the flights.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.140]   And the way I typically do that is not
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.060]   looking for my home destination, but just
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.660]   looking at the specific nonstop flights
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.620]   because you get a sense of what the international prices are
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.580]   going to be.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.860]   So I'm going to go to Google Flights.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.460]   And I'm going to search for San Francisco or LAX.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.700]   And so you can search multiple froms and multiple
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.020]   tos at Google Flights.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.300]   And so you type SFO.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.780]   And then the easiest way to do it is once you hit comma,
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.100]   Google Flights saves that.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.940]   And so you could type SFO comma, LAX comma,
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.540]   and then you search Papeete.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.660]   Now, unfortunately, Google Flights
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.900]   will not let you search for nonstop flights
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.820]   from the get-go.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.180]   So you have to click into a search
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.860]   and then filter to nonstop.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.700]   So now that I've filtered to nonstop,
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.020]   I'm going to look at round-trip flights from SFO or LAX
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.180]   to Papeete.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.060]   I'm going to go in and search.
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.400]   By clicking on the date field, you can actually
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.760]   in the bottom left say, show me five-day trips.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.340]   And you can actually look at how much
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.900]   these tickets are going to cost.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.180]   And what I'm seeing is that on most days for the rest of March
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.660]   and a lot of days in April, the round-trip tickets
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.700]   are $550 to $600, $700, which is pretty
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.540]   reasonable for a long-distance international flight.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.540]   So out the gate, I'm thinking, wow,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.780]   I don't even know if I want to use miles.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.220]   But it's a short trip.
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.820]   A lot of the flights are overnight.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.540]   I've got a lot of miles.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.100]   What about business?
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.500]   Every now and then, I look at business internationally,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.220]   and it's really not that much more.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.100]   In this case, I'm going to look, and I already
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.380]   know what I'm going to see.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.540]   It's going to be almost $5,000 or more, which for me,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.680]   just makes it completely off the table.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.940]   So at this point, I've kind of said, all right,
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.420]   I'm going to fly economy, or I'm going
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.520]   to see if there's miles available for business.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.560]   Obviously, if the miles are available for business
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.100]   and it's a good deal, that's what I would prefer to do.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.940]   So now that I know the flight routes there are,
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.480]   you can click through Google Flights,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.580]   and you can see, OK, well, United has a flight.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.420]   Air Tahiti Nui has a flight.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.100]   Air France has a flight.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.820]   Keep in mind that for a lot of international destinations,
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.740]   the day you fly on might actually
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.420]   change what airlines have flights.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.580]   They might not all have flights the same day.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.040]   So if you're clicking through days,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.580]   you'll actually see that on some days,
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.880]   an airline called French Bee actually
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.640]   flies from San Francisco.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.640]   It's the airline we flew down to French Polynesia
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.000]   the last time we came.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.640]   And I thought it was a great experience.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.400]   So definitely click around to make sure you know
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.300]   what airlines are looking for.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.600]   Now, I can tell you in advance that French Bee doesn't
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.480]   have a mileage program that lets you book award tickets.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.880]   So I'm going to start looking first on United.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.920]   Now, if you search SFO to PPT, and you search a date,
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.720]   you click Award Travel, you're going
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.360]   to get a list of flights for that day.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.820]   But you're also going to get an award calendar at the top.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.320]   And if you click under that, you'll
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.920]   see View 30-Day Calendar.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.520]   And you can actually see all the different award prices.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.880]   So you'll see that on every Sunday and really Tuesday,
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.280]   almost all the flights United flies for the rest of March
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.200]   and into April.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   Almost every week, you can find a flight for 35,000 or 37,000
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.720]   miles, but knowing that the flights are only 600 round trip,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.400]   and if you dig into the one-way prices,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.920]   you'll learn they're about 380 going down, maybe 280 or 300
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.480]   coming back.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.120]   I'm not sure I'd rather use 35,000 miles for the ticket.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   But if I look in business, you'll
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.680]   see that 70,000 points going down,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.480]   United has availability on the next four Sundays.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.200]   And you can go search round trip,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   see when it's available on the way coming back.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.920]   So now all of a sudden, I've said, OK, that's low inventory.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   I know that that's one of the lowest prices you'll see.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.680]   United even highlights it in green
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.280]   if it's the lowest price in the month.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.880]   So now we're like, OK, so United has some tickets coming down.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.480]   You can also check the other airlines.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.240]   So I said French B doesn't have anything,
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.640]   but there's also Air France, and there's Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.660]   So you can go through the Air France website
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.720]   and do it for Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.160]   While I'm sure you don't have Air Tahiti Nui in miles,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.020]   you probably maybe have or have access from a transfer partner
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.740]   to American who are partners, so you could book for American.
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.820]   So you can actually search those flights on their websites.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.980]   I have a subscription to a website called Expert Flyer,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.740]   and that site lets you search award inventory
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.740]   for a lot of flights.
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.320]   So I can actually go there and just say,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.620]   I'm looking for LAX to PPT, and do a search.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.140]   One of the great features they have
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.260]   is that you can search three days before and three days
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.780]   after.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.820]   So you can search seven days at a time.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.460]   And I can go in and search Air Tahiti Nui,
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.740]   and I can say I'm looking for a business award.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.740]   And it'll come back and show you, here's what we found.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.180]   Now, I can tell you that it's hard to find
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.480]   award availability far out in advance.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.860]   A lot of airlines don't release all their inventory.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.820]   But when you're trying to book something somewhat last minute,
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.420]   sometimes you get really, really lucky.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.940]   So in the case of United, you saw
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.260]   that we got award availability on business class seats
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.340]   four days in a row on Air Tahiti Nui.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.580]   It looks like I'm currently looking,
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.380]   and there's nothing to get down.
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:19.660]   But coming back, if you want to leave on the 30th of March,
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.460]   there's five seats back to LA.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.620]   So maybe that's an option.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.040]   And the availability changes all the time.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.340]   Expert Flyer actually lets you set alerts to say, hey,
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.260]   if something pops up, let me know.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.340]   I'll save you the looking.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.620]   Air France had no availability, so I'll just skip over it.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.300]   But if you really wanted to book that Air Tahiti Nui flight,
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.820]   you can actually go on American Airlines' website,
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.280]   and you can just search PPT LAX.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.520]   You can say book with miles, and it'll show up.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.080]   I happen to know that it's going to be 80,000 miles to book
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.900]   that flight.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.220]   And so from my perspective, I'd rather just
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.300]   use the 72,000 United miles.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.420]   However, one of the things to know
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.540]   is that when there's availability on an airline,
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.420]   that means that you can book it from any of their partners.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.020]   So that's where a search like point.me really
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.700]   comes in to benefit you.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.060]   So I'm going to go do this search on point.me,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.940]   and I already did it, but I have it pulled up in front of me.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.380]   And what happens is they say, yep,
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.320]   we found the availability on United.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.380]   This was for March 20th.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.260]   And when you look at the options to book it, they say, yeah,
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.500]   you can book it with United with 72,800 miles,
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.580]   but you can also book it with Air Canada for 55,000 miles.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.020]   And Air Canada happens to be a transfer partner of Amex,
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.900]   Capital One, and Chase.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.340]   And let me tell you, I love Air Canada as a mileage program.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.020]   The aeroplane program has some really great spots
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.700]   of redemption just like this.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.140]   So now I'm thinking, OK, whether you have Amex points,
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.700]   Capital One points, Chase points,
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.380]   or you happen to be someone with Air Canada points,
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.740]   that's 55,000 miles down.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.260]   You can find the return, 55,000 back.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.140]   That's 110,000 miles for your trip.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.220]   So what is 110,000 miles worth?
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.460]   Well, if you know that the business class flight would
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.940]   have been about $5,700, then that's $0.05 a mile.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.380]   To put that in perspective, if you
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.220]   were using a card that earns you three points per dollar
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.500]   on travel expenses, and you can get $0.05 per mile,
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.020]   that's like getting 15% cash back.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.660]   So I think that's an amazing deal.
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.260]   And in fact, that is exactly what we did to come down here.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.540]   We got Air Canada miles, and we used
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.780]   them to book United business class seats for 110,000 miles
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.460]   each.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.700]   And the taxes, as you could see, were $36.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.620]   And it's really easy.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.060]   You can create an account on Air Canada's website.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.780]   You can go search for the flights.
[00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.740]   And once you find the availability,
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.020]   you can go to Chase or Cap One and do the transfer.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.140]   Usually, you just log out, log back in, and boom.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.740]   They show up right there.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.140]   Make it really easy to book.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.220]   So that's how we got here.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.700]   We booked it through on United, in business,
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.100]   with Air Canada miles.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.420]   It ended up being $36 each way per person,
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.300]   whereas the two business class tickets would
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.020]   have been over $11,000.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.420]   So that's flights.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.580]   That is how I typically do all of this searching.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.460]   Point.me is a great place.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.460]   You could even start there if you want.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.540]   It's pretty great at searching across lots
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.180]   of different travel sites.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.980]   The challenge is they don't have any flexible date search.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.580]   So when you go to United's website,
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.180]   you can look at a 30-day calendar
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.740]   and get a sense of whether there's something great one day.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.060]   With Point.me, you've got to go search a day,
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.300]   and then the next day, and then the next day.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.060]   So when there's only a few options of flights,
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.420]   sometimes-- and you're flexible on dates.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.900]   I like to start searching on the airline's websites.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.460]   But if you're pretty strict on dates
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.580]   and you're going somewhere with lots of options,
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.500]   like the US to Europe, it could definitely
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.740]   be easier to search on Point.me.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.180]   But keep in mind, sometimes there's
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.220]   strange things that happen, where
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.460]   it might be availability from San Francisco to Paris,
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.020]   but not from Paris to, let's say, Nice, France.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.860]   And it might be a really cheap flight.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.300]   So definitely make sure that when
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.100]   you're looking for award flights,
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.860]   you're not just looking at the whole trip.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.860]   You might be looking at the major leg that you really want.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.660]   And you could maybe buy a cheap $50, $100 ticket
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.260]   on either end to make it all the way to your destination.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.980]   So now let's talk about hotels.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.700]   Once I figured out we could get flights
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.860]   and I knew that there were a lot of different days--
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.740]   and actually, I'm speaking in Bora Bora right now.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.320]   So when I was looking at this, United
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.980]   had a business class three different days
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.900]   in a single week.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.100]   So I kind of knew I had a little bit of flexibility.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.300]   We probably had 12 days and we wanted to go for six.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.140]   So I kind of had a little bit of wiggle room.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.440]   So I said, great, now I know that the flights are there.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.540]   Let's pause and let's look at hotels.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.700]   And I think one of the first things
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.180]   to do when you're looking at hotels
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.380]   is just to get a sense of what are the rates.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.920]   Because sometimes, miles and points for hotels
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.100]   don't make a lot of sense.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.700]   Sometimes I like Google for hotels.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.500]   Their hotel search is pretty good.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.660]   Lots of websites to look for hotels.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.420]   Whichever one has the right filters you like, go for it.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.700]   You could use TripAdvisor.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.980]   You could use Kayak.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.580]   It really just matters what you like.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.660]   Right now, we're not trying to book a hotel.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.220]   We're just trying to search.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.540]   So if I go on and search Bora Bora on Google Hotels,
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.360]   you'll see that there are a lot of hotels that come up.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.820]   Fortunately for Bora Bora, there aren't an unlimited number.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.780]   There's like eight or nine hotels
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.060]   that are kind of high-end, go take a luxury vacation.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.980]   And so I can look at them and say, OK, well, look.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.940]   The Conrad, $722 a night.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.660]   St. Regis, $1,200 a night.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.340]   And I'm here looking March 21st to 26th.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.980]   Once you find a hotel, one of the nice things
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.100]   that Google will let you do-- and it doesn't work
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.740]   until you pick the hotel.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.580]   But in this example, if you go and click View Prices
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.860]   on a Google Hotels listing, now you can actually
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.700]   go to the dates and they'll say, best prices for one night stay.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.660]   And they'll show you all the prices.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.580]   And so you can actually look out and say, wow,
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.220]   there are some days that are ridiculously expensive.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.340]   I'm looking right now, April 4th.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.140]   The average rate for a night at the St. Regis in Bora Bora
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.500]   is $3,500 to $3,000 a night, which
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.060]   means a five-night stay is going to cost you almost $20,000.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.740]   When I actually booked this trip, the rate per night
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.060]   was about $2,100.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.300]   For me, I was like, wow, there's no world
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.380]   where I could get comfortable spending $10,000 on a vacation.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.500]   So it's time to look at points.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.800]   And fortunately, in Bora Bora, there's
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.660]   two intercontinental hotels.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.820]   There's a Conrad.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.900]   There's a St. Regis.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.340]   All you different Hilton, Marriott, or IHG points,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.060]   all which have transfer partners.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.340]   So when I'm trying to find the award hotels where
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.180]   I might get the best deal, I love this site, awardmapper.com.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.260]   If you're watching the video, you'll
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.180]   see that I actually have it pulled up in Paris
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.220]   because there's a bit of a bug on the site
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.580]   right now when it comes to Bora Bora.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.660]   But I just want to show a little bit how it works.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.460]   So you can go to anywhere in the world,
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.580]   and you can click different filters for hotel programs,
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.700]   whether it's Hilton, or Marriott, or Intercon,
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.420]   and see all the hotels in that region that
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.940]   participate in that program.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.980]   So unfortunately, if you go to Bora Bora on AwardMapper,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.380]   you will only see three hotels.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.500]   You won't see all of them.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.220]   Unfortunately, I had done enough research
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.940]   to know what they were.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.740]   So I looked at Intercon.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.780]   I looked at St. Regis.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.980]   I looked at the Conrad.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.980]   And basically, the way I do those searches
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.200]   is on their websites.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.700]   So if you go to the Marriott website, and you say,
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.860]   I want to look at the St. Regis Bora Bora,
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.380]   you can say flexible dates, which I love doing.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.140]   And I like to search for just one night
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.580]   so you get a sense of all the availability.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.220]   Click Use Points, and click View Rates.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.900]   And what you'll get is a calendar
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.220]   of 30 days of availability.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.420]   And you can see which nights have availability.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.580]   Right now, you can see that there
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.180]   are six nights for the rest of March, which it's the 18th.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.580]   So 50% of the days left in March still have availability.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.020]   And in April, there's 13 nights.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.540]   So a little bit less than half of April.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.380]   It's not perfect.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.420]   It's not like you could stay for 10 days in a row.
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.540]   But I will say, when you search this availability,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.820]   it changes a lot.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.700]   I remember right before we booked it,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.700]   one of the days we wanted to stay was gone.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700]   I waited six hours.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.420]   It came back.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.180]   And I'll actually pull up.
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.820]   So this is what the chart looked like.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.620]   If you're watching the video, you'll see it.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.540]   But when I was booking, the chart for March--
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.100]   the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 12th, 15th,
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.740]   all the way to the 22nd were all available.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.020]   And then the next day, the 13th and the 14th
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.140]   opened up, which is when we ended up actually coming down
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:13.740]   here.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.380]   So already, I was looking at 70,000 to 85,000 points
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.260]   a night thinking, this is probably
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.300]   going to be the way we're going to do this trip.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.220]   But we stayed at the Conrad a few years ago.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.460]   And it was fantastic.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.700]   And while I don't have a lot of Hilton points,
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.380]   they often have transfer bonuses from Amex.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.020]   So I thought it'd be worth looking.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.300]   So I looked at the Conrad.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.540]   You check use points.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.380]   You can hit View Available Dates.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.460]   And sometimes, it's crazy.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.900]   So I'm looking right now.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.620]   And if you want to make a last-minute trip
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.180]   for the next four days, it's 120,000 points per night,
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.460]   which is a pretty good deal.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.180]   If you want to go beyond that, it's
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.780]   1.3 million points per night, which
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.100]   is a terrible, terrible use of Hilton points.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.900]   So you might find some great deals with Hilton
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.740]   if you're looking.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.300]   But like I said, those rooms sometimes
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.060]   can be as low as $700, $800 a night, which, look,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.300]   that is a really expensive hotel room.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.540]   But this is also a really, really expensive place
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.820]   to be that can cost $2,000 or $3,000 a night.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.860]   So if you find a deal with dollars,
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.020]   it might be worth doing that.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.380]   For us, we ended up able to take advantage of the Marriott
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.300]   deal, where you book four nights, get the fifth free.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.980]   And it was about $85,000 a night.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.980]   So we paid about-- actually, I know exactly.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.940]   We paid 340,000 points.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.260]   And I'll pull up my confirmation right here,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.100]   which shows it was 340,000 points for the whole stay.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.860]   And it was 2,000 French Polynesian dollars,
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.700]   which is about $20.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.300]   So all in now, our flights were about $188 of taxes.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.700]   And our hotel was about $20 in fees.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.340]   We're at about $200.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.580]   And our rooms, otherwise, were over $2,000 a night,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.420]   so $10,000.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.700]   Our flights were over $11,000.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.140]   So this is a $20,000 vacation that we just
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:00.980]   booked last minute for less than $200,
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.100]   and about 340,000 Marriott points,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.020]   and about 220,000 Chase points.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.820]   I think we used Chase points, or you could use Capital One or Amex.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.780]   One thing to share, if you're going
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.580]   to book, whether it's with points or dollars,
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.620]   one of the things a lot of people want to know,
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.620]   if you're coming to a place like Bora Bora,
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.820]   is how do you get that upgrade?
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.400]   And the way I recommend thinking about that
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.220]   is, there's a website called Flyer Talk.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.100]   And for almost every hotel you can book with miles,
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.900]   there's a thread.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.580]   And you can go way down the rabbit hole,
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.860]   and I wouldn't recommend that.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.780]   But I would find the thread on the hotel
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.620]   you're trying to book at, and just read a little bit.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.780]   Jump all the way to the end.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.300]   See the recent reports of what people have found.
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.280]   A lot of these hotels, you can book a basic room,
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.700]   email them, and upgrade it with dollars.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.660]   You might even get a better deal than sometimes
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.220]   the online price to upgrade your hotel.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.100]   And then you can also just take your chances,
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.020]   if you have status.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.580]   Or if you book it through a program, or a travel agent,
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.540]   or something like that, you might
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.440]   be able to be waitlisted for an upgrade if it's available.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.540]   I'm actually working on an experiment
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.020]   right now with a travel company that
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.840]   would allow all listeners of this show
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.980]   to be able to book luxury properties around the world
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.700]   and get those kind of amenities.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.980]   So if you're listening right now and you're
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.660]   looking at booking with dollars at a higher end property
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.700]   anywhere in the world, and you want things
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.420]   like free breakfast, or upgrades, or late checkout,
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.460]   and stuff like that, shoot me an email
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.980]   and we can do a little beta test here
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.180]   and see if we can get you hooked up on your next trip.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.660]   Wouldn't cost you anything extra.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.180]   So that's what I would recommend doing,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.820]   is definitely do some research to see if there's
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.460]   a way you can get that upgrade.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.300]   I know in a place like Bora Bora,
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.220]   some hotels, the cheap room that you book with points,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.060]   and in our case, was not an overwater bungalow,
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.100]   but it was a villa on the beach.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.580]   It's funny, if you talk to people who've been here a lot,
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.540]   some people say, you know what?
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.220]   Once the allure of the overwater bungalow wears off,
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.380]   the beach villa where you kind of have your own hammock
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.980]   and your own plunge pool and all that stuff,
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.620]   it's actually nicer.
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.860]   Hasn't worn off for me yet.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.500]   I'm really enjoying jumping in the water from the balcony,
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.460]   so one day maybe I'll get there,
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.020]   but certainly not there today.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.380]   So that covers flights to French Polynesia,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.180]   that covers your hotel in Bora Bora,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.580]   but there's one important thing I forgot to mention,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.860]   and that's that Bora Bora is not located on the same island
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.020]   as Papiete, where all the international flights come in.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.900]   So you need to get there,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.780]   and the only way to really get there
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.920]   is to fly on Air Tahiti,
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.580]   and the fares are relatively the same.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.220]   You book on their website.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.900]   They're not the cheapest, but they're not crazy expensive.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.580]   I think if you book really last minute,
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.340]   it might be about $400 round trip,
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.100]   but that's really your only option,
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.420]   so there's no hacks, there's no tricks,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.500]   but what is interesting to know
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.180]   is a lot of the flights that come down here during the day
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.380]   and leave as a red-eye going back home or vice versa
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.060]   mean that you're either gonna land late at night
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.300]   or you're gonna take off really early in the morning,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.780]   and one hack, if you're able to swing it,
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.220]   is to book on an airline or even split
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.620]   and book on two airlines
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.160]   so you have an overnight flight each way.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.580]   Otherwise, if you have a super early morning flight
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.300]   going out or you land really late at night,
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.620]   there are no flights to get to an island
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.040]   that leave after or leave early enough
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.420]   to make your connection.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.740]   So for us, we ended up getting in around 8 p.m.,
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.140]   and we spent one night at the Intercontinental in Tahiti.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.740]   It was actually fantastic.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.180]   We actually spent almost the whole next day
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.000]   and took an afternoon flight out.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.820]   The pool was amazing, the snorkeling was great.
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.200]   Overall, I had a great experience.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.700]   There's also a Hilton near the airport.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.780]   Both looked great.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.780]   So if you don't get in early enough to make a connection
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.940]   or if you're flying out early in the morning
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.660]   and you need to stay a night before,
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.220]   I could recommend both those places.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.940]   I won't go into it in this podcast,
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.100]   but there's also a ton of great hotels
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.540]   on the island of Morea,
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.100]   which is really close to the main island of Tahiti.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.020]   So if you wanna split your trip up, check that out.
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.100]   There's a lot of other islands here worth checking out.
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.900]   But I just figured I'd focus on the trip we just planned
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.060]   and walk you through it all.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.420]   So that's how to book flights.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.000]   That's how to book hotels.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.780]   And once you've done that,
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.980]   there's really not that much more to do.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.420]   I wanted to share two things.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.420]   One, I have a bunch of hacks that I've learned
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.380]   from two trips here.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.940]   And two, I just wanna kinda compare and contrast
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.140]   the two places I've stayed
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.820]   in case you happen to be listening to this and thinking,
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.900]   should I stay at the St. Regis?
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.660]   Should I stay at the Conrad?
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.560]   First off, it doesn't matter which one you pick.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.460]   They're both gonna be absolutely amazing.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.980]   But I figure, should you have the question,
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.360]   it might be worth sharing.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.900]   So first off, if you're thinking of booking this,
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.240]   one hack that I've heard a lot of people we've met
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.020]   at the resort have told us
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.820]   is that they actually booked their trip on Costco.
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.320]   Now, I've never used Costco's travel program.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.180]   And when I tried to look online before recording this,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.500]   it looks like you have to call for availability.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.360]   But we talked to at least three couples
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.940]   that said they looked around
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.860]   and the best possible deal they found
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.340]   was booking through Costco.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.980]   And it included their flight from LA.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.900]   And all they had to do was get to LA.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.180]   So I'll definitely say, try that out
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.580]   if you're looking at coming here
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.420]   and taking an amazing vacation.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.940]   Some people actually booked packages
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.980]   that included their dinner.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.740]   In a lot of places in the world,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.900]   I would never want to make
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.160]   that kind of a commitment in advance
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.740]   to eat at the hotel every single night.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.460]   But if you're coming somewhere like Bora Bora,
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.220]   like the Maldives,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.080]   where the options outside of your resort are almost nothing.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.640]   In fact, I don't think we will eat outside of the resort
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.660]   the entire time we're here
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.180]   because there's nowhere to walk to.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.620]   Yes, you could take a boat,
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.620]   but then you'd need to charter a boat to come back.
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.320]   It just seems like a lot of work.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.680]   So we've been eating at the resort
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.300]   and it's been fantastic.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.020]   So if that's the circumstance
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.740]   and there's a deal to book your dinner
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.540]   and that dinner is reasonably priced,
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.780]   and let me remind you that all food here is expensive.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.420]   So I will say that while we've saved a ton of money
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.500]   booking the flights with points
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.640]   and a ton of money booking the hotel with points,
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.840]   there is no deal to get affordable food.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.060]   There are some hacks to save a little bit of money,
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.500]   but at the end of the day,
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.860]   if you're coming to a place like this,
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.500]   you're just gonna have to bite the bullet
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.580]   and spend money on food
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.820]   because it's the only way to do it
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.180]   and really enjoy yourself.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.900]   So I wanna share a few of the differences
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.620]   between the two hotels I've stayed at here.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.600]   I'll go through it quickly
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.540]   because most of you are probably not looking
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.900]   to plan a trip to Bora Bora in the near future
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.220]   and pick between these exact two hotels,
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.380]   but maybe comparing them will help you guys think about
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.600]   ways to compare other hotels in the future.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.060]   So when I think about the two,
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.500]   what was obvious in advance was that the Conrad was newer.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.380]   It had only been open for a few years when we went in 2018
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.580]   and the St. Regis has been open a lot longer.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.800]   That doesn't mean a lot in terms of quality
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.820]   because the St. Regis is absolutely incredible,
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.380]   but it does mean that you have a little bit
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.340]   of a different vibe.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.340]   The Conrad vibe was a little bit more modern
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.660]   and perfectly manicured
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.500]   and there's Bluetooth speakers in the room
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.820]   that you can pair your phone with
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.840]   and the St. Regis was just as luxurious,
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.180]   but maybe a little less modern.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.100]   A couple other fun quick hits,
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.820]   the St. Regis has this beautiful lagoon with fish
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.220]   that you can snorkel in,
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.380]   but around all the villas,
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.820]   the water is just beautiful, clear water.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.460]   You can see it behind me if you're watching the video.
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.340]   Whereas the Conrad didn't have any special place to snorkel
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.460]   but the entire villas were surrounded by coral reefs.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.660]   So the snorkeling right off of your balcony
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.260]   or your patio was incredible.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.100]   When it comes to upgrades,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.940]   the Conrad has about 30, I think, rooms that aren't over water
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.300]   and I think the St. Regis has closer to 10.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.140]   So the likelihood that there will be an extra room
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.520]   because there's just more of the St. Regis rooms
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.180]   are over water bungalows.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.660]   I think you might have a higher likelihood
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.140]   of getting that upgrade at the St. Regis.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:52.140]   Conrad did have this amazingly hard mini golf course.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.100]   Maybe the hardest mini golf course you could ever imagine
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.020]   that isn't mechanical or anything,
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.220]   just really difficult holes, but it was a lot of fun.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.740]   And at the St. Regis and the Conrad,
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.460]   they both had what I wish every hotel had,
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.560]   which was all the activities at the beach were free.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.340]   You wanna borrow a standup paddleboard.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.400]   You wanna borrow a HobieCat and go sailing.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.900]   You wanna borrow one of those weird bikes
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.420]   that has like six foot tall inflatable wheels, free.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.740]   You want snorkel equipment, free.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.460]   You even want sunscreen, it's free.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.060]   So one of the nicest things
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.620]   about some of these higher end resorts
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.020]   is that you do, after paying for the expensive room,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.740]   get a lot of the amenities on the property
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.300]   without having to pay extra.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   Even at the St. Regis,
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.820]   you can use all of the amenities of the spa,
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.420]   the steam room, the sauna, everything for free
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.220]   just by calling and reserving it.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.380]   Other than that, I think they both have amazing food.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.300]   It is expensive.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   I'll just flag that for anyone listening.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.580]   Just be prepared.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.820]   But yeah, it's hard to go wrong.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.960]   I think the last point that I think a lot of people
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.440]   come to Bora Bora for this beautiful view of the mountain
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.780]   and the kind of volcanic looking structure
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.380]   in the middle of the island,
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.260]   that isn't visible from the Conrad.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.100]   So if your dream is that like classic Bora Bora picture,
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.300]   looking out your balcony to that view,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.580]   you won't get that at the Conrad.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.020]   What you will get is a view of this beautiful,
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.920]   endless ocean that you, yeah, it's unbelievable.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.540]   I mean, I can't, you could king pick any resort here
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.220]   and I'm sure it'd be totally fine.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.800]   So those were a few of the differences.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.300]   I hope that was helpful.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.920]   Finally, some quick hacks and tips for a trip to Bora Bora.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.400]   Some of these are applicable anywhere you go.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.780]   So one, definitely do an excursion to go out
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.820]   and swim with the sharks and the stingrays.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.000]   It's one of the coolest things you can ever do.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.980]   I thought it was amazing.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.000]   Also, don't pack as much sunscreen as you think you need.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.380]   Almost every resort, at least the two we've stayed at,
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.200]   have unlimited free sunscreen.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.380]   Bring floats.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.940]   So if you want to just sit out in the ocean off your patio,
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.100]   there's some really cool, cheap, small packable floats.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.660]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.140]   We bought two of them.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.260]   Or just make friends because a lot of people bring floats
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.900]   and don't want to carry them back.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.980]   So shout out to Sam and Gabe who travel around the States
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.860]   in a van and bought an amazing pink flamingo
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.760]   and left it for us.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.040]   My wife got a ton of great use out of it,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.760]   so I really appreciate that.
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.140]   If you can, for a place like this,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.860]   do your overnight flights so that you don't have to spend
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.940]   an extra day on lodging.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.940]   If you're staying at a place where there's not a lot
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.220]   of stuff walkable or accessible,
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.840]   I always like to stop at the store somewhere,
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.980]   whether it's on your layover or on the cab ride over,
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.540]   even sometimes at the airport,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.500]   and just pick up a handful of snacks, maybe some drinks,
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.180]   especially if it's a place like this
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.620]   and you want some alcohol.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.660]   It could be really expensive at a resort.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.140]   Pick up a few things.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.180]   I don't expect it to be all the food you'll need,
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.580]   all the drink you'll need, et cetera,
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.220]   but it does feel good sometimes to be like,
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.360]   ah, finally, I got a $3 beer
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.380]   instead of the $8 resort beer.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.580]   And maybe that's just a small part of me
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.220]   that feels like I want a couple wins on a trip
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.980]   because I know it's really expensive.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.580]   But that's a tip I have because a lot of times also,
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.660]   there aren't some great snacks.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.040]   Room service, you might be able to get French fries
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.700]   as a side dish, but there aren't always just a bag of chips
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.140]   or some granola or something small like that.
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.020]   So that's all the hacks I have for a trip like this,
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.040]   and hopefully this episode gives you some ideas
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.880]   to help you book your next trip.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.180]   But if you have any follow-up questions or feedback,
