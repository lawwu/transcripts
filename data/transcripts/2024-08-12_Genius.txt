[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.760]   That used to be me, until I started tuning into The Kim Commando Show. It's on over 400
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.440]   top radio stations and packed with the latest in tech, AI, security tips, and tricks. Here's a
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   secret I learned. If an Amazon package has the letters LPN, the item was returned. It's not new.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.160]   Join millions who rely on Kim Commando. That's The Kim Commando Show. K-O-M-A-N-D-O.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.120]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. I'm your host. And today,
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.240]   I want to talk about genius, mastery, high-level performance, how you can develop these skills in
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.080]   yourself for success in any area to which you are attracted and to which you put your mind,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.120]   as well as how we can cultivate this in our children. I was reminded that I had intended
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.920]   to do this podcast months and months ago, but I had forgotten. In answering a question on Friday's
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920]   Q&A show, I was asked about this, and I realized I had never did this podcast I intended to do.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640]   And then I got a couple of emails over the weekend of people saying, "Joshua,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.520]   please do the podcast." So here it is. This will be related to money in the sense that earning
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   money and generating high skills is related to your ability to produce money, but it's not going
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.720]   to be related to personal finance beyond that. But I do think it'll be applicable in all of the
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.480]   social aspects of your life, your career, your children, their lives, and their careers.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.080]   I want to begin by telling you just my pathway, and I will cite for you the three books that
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.520]   interested me in this topic the most. The first book that I ran into was a book called Peek,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:06.480]   P-E-A-K, Peek, written by an author named Anders Erikson, last name spelled E-R-I-C-S-S-O-N. The
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.040]   subtitle is called Peek, Secrets from the New Science of Expertise. And I learned about this
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.480]   book because I stumbled into some online essays talking about deliberate practice. Specifically,
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.800]   I think the essay that I found that originally inspired me was an essay called How to Use
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.120]   Deliberate Practice to Reach the Top 1% of Your Field by Nate Eliasson. I will link to that in
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.520]   the show notes today. And in this essay, he talks a little bit about Anders Erikson. I'll read the
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   introduction to the essay. "In the late 1970s, Anders Erikson devised a very boring experiment.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.800]   His subject, Steve Falloon, was instructed to memorize random strings of numbers.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.160]   Erikson's interest was in how many numbers Steve could keep in his head with consistent practice.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.600]   The research and common wisdom at the time said you could only hold around seven to eight random
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.640]   bits of information in your head at a time. And so far, Steve was proving the research.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.720]   In each session, Erikson and Steve would sit down, and Erikson would read him a random string
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.000]   of numbers at a rate of one per second. By the end of their fourth one-hour session together,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.960]   Steve could reliably recite back strings of seven or eight digits, but he'd struggle with nine and
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.200]   never successfully remembered ten, until he made a breakthrough. During their fifth session, Steve
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.080]   succeeded at remembering his first ten-digit string and followed it up with his first eleven-digit
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.240]   string. It may seem trivial, but when the average person, including Steve at first,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.960]   can only remember seven, this is a fifty-seven percent improvement over average.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.880]   Steve was only getting started, though. He and Erikson continued their work together,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.040]   and by the end of the 200th session, he could reliably memorize strings of 82 random digits.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.880]   He didn't have any gift. He didn't have any special training. He simply practiced week
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.960]   after week in a special way, the same way that's created chess prodigies, world record holders,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   Olympic gold medalists, prolific writers, and any master of their craft that you're familiar with
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.240]   today. Anders Erikson devoted his life's work to studying this technique for effective skill
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.840]   development and coined the term "deliberate practice" to describe it. So just remember
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   those numbers, that at the time in the 70s, scientists thought you could only hold seven
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.160]   or eight random bits of information in your head at the time. Steve wound up consistently and
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.920]   reliably being able to memorize strings of 82 random digits. Interestingly, since that time,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.200]   memory experts have gone far beyond Steve's records. I don't know what the current records
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.280]   are, but they went far beyond his accomplishments, which were extremely fascinating. And Anders
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.200]   Erikson in his book "Peak" talks about that and talks about the process that Steve went through
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.760]   to do it. And basically, if I were to boil it down to its essence, he systematically worked
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.000]   at figuring out new ways to categorize and store the information. In Steve's case, as a research
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.280]   subject, he used baseball trivia as kind of the pegboard for his information. Other memory
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.360]   scientists have gone on and created other elaborate encoding schemes that allow them to encode the
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.720]   random digits in a very effective way. But Steve didn't have any training. There was no one to
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.160]   train him on it. He just sat down and kept on working at this thing and got enormously better
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.680]   because he had this personality trait to stick with it for a very long period of time.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.480]   Now, it was that essay that led me to go and try to find Erikson's book, which I found,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.200]   called "Peak, Secrets from the New Science of Expertise," published in 2017. I would strongly
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.840]   encourage you, if you're interested in this topic, to read that book and to start with it.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   I thought it was really, really well-created and fascinating, some of the insights that I learned
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.480]   from it, some of which I'll share with you right now. Here is the introductory blurb from Amazon.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.600]   "Anders Erikson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.800]   and memory mavens. 'Peak' distills three decades of myth-shattering research into a powerful
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.280]   learning strategy that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.680]   acquiring new abilities. Whether you want to stand out at work, improve your athletic or
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.560]   musical performance, or help your child achieve academic goals, Erikson's revolutionary methods
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.120]   will show you how to improve at almost any skill that matters to you." It's a great book. And I
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.440]   think if you could only read one of the three books that I'm going to talk about, I think it
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:58.800]   should be this one. And here was what I took away from the book. The first thing is simply that as
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:08.080]   we learn, we get better, and our ability to learn increases. Erikson spent his entire lifetime,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.760]   his entire academic career, I think at Florida State University, studying high performers.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.800]   And he came away from that career's research making statements similar to the idea that
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:29.680]   never in my life have I found a genius performer, a high-level performer to which I can't explain
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.200]   his long-term success and performance based upon the function of the application of what he calls
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.480]   deliberate practice, which we'll talk about in a moment, and doing deliberate practice for a
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.040]   sufficient amount of time. He goes through every proclaimed genius and virtuoso in history and
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   shows how we can understand this dramatically amazing overperformance based upon the use of
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.240]   the principles of deliberate practice and applying those principles for a sufficient amount of time.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.600]   I can't remember all of the specific examples, but they would include Mozart, they include Tiger
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.720]   Woods, they include all these different people that are just renowned as high performers. And
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:26.240]   he shows how they got that way most likely due to environmental factors and high amounts of the
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.880]   right kind of practice. One of the anecdotes that he told in the story that was so fascinating to me
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.560]   involved a discussion of something like perfect pitch. Here's a little bit of the story.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.720]   The year is 1763 and a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is about to embark on a tour around Europe
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.800]   that will jumpstart the Mozart legend. Just seven years old and barely tall enough to see over the
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.320]   top of a harpsichord, he captivates audiences in his hometown of Salzburg with his skill on the
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.560]   violin and various keyboard instruments. He plays with a facility that seems impossible to believe
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   in someone so young. But Mozart has another trick up his sleeve that is, if anything, even more
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.080]   surprising to the people of his era. We know about this talent because it was described in a rather
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.160]   breathless letter to the editor about the young Mozart that was published in the newspaper in
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.240]   Augsburg, Mozart's father's hometown, shortly before Mozart and his family left Salzburg for
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:32.160]   their tour. The letter writer reported that when the young Mozart heard a note played on a musical
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.000]   instrument, any note, he could immediately identify exactly which note it was. The A-sharp in the
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.680]   second octave above middle C, perhaps, or the E-flat below middle C. Mozart could do this even
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.080]   if he was in another room and could not see the instrument being played, and he could do it not
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   just for the violin and fortepiano, but for every instrument he heard. And Mozart's father, as a
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   composer and music teacher, had nearly every imaginable musical instrument in his house.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.160]   Nor was it just musical instruments. The boy could identify the notes produced by anything
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.560]   that was sufficiently musical. The chime of a clock, the toll of a bell, the achoo of a sneeze.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.400]   It was an ability that most adult musicians of the time, even the most experienced, could not match.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.440]   And it seemed, even more than Mozart's skill on keyboard and violin, to be an example of the
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.080]   mysterious gifts that this young prodigy had been born with. That ability is not quite so mysterious
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.760]   to us today, of course. We know a good deal more about it now than 250 years ago, and most people
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.920]   today have at least heard of it. The technical term is "absolute pitch," although it is better
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:47.360]   known as "perfect pitch," and it is exceptionally rare. Only about one in every 10,000 people has
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.560]   it. It is much less rare among world-class musicians than among the rest of us, but even
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.520]   among virtuosos it is far from normal. Beethoven is thought to have had it. Brahms did not. Vladimir
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   Horowitz had it. Igor Stravinsky did not. Frank Sinatra had it. Miles Davis did not. It would
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   seem, in short, to be a perfect example of an innate talent that a few lucky people are born
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.560]   with and most are not. Indeed, that is what was widely believed for at least 200 years.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.440]   But over the past few decades, a very different understanding of perfect pitch has emerged,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:29.120]   one that points to an equally different vision of the sorts of gifts that life has to offer.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.160]   The first hint emerged with the observation that the only people who had received this
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.800]   "gift" had also received some sort of musical training early in their childhood. In particular,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.440]   a good deal of research has shown that nearly everyone with perfect pitch began musical
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:52.720]   training at a very young age, generally around 3-5 years old. But if perfect pitch is an innate
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.800]   ability, something that you are either born with or not, then it shouldn't make any difference
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.400]   whether you received music training as a child. All that should matter is that you get enough
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.600]   musical training, at any time in your life, to learn the names of the notes.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.040]   The next clue appeared when researchers noticed that perfect pitch is much more common among
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.000]   people who speak a tonal language, such as Mandarin Chinese, Vietnamese, and several
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.480]   other Asian tongues, in which the meaning of words is dependent on their pitch.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.160]   If perfect pitch is indeed a genetic gift, then the only way that the tonal language connection
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.280]   would make sense would be if people of Asian ancestry are more likely to have genes for
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.320]   perfect pitch than people whose ancestors come from elsewhere, such as Europe or Africa.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.640]   But that is something that is easy to test for. You just recruit a number of people of
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.440]   Asian ancestry who grew up speaking English or some other non-tonal language and see if
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.160]   they are more likely to have perfect pitch. That research has been done, and it turns out that
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.480]   people of Asian heritage who don't grow up speaking a tonal language are no more likely
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.160]   than people of other ethnicities to have perfect pitch. So, it's not the Asian genetic heritage,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   but rather learning a tonal language that makes having perfect pitch more likely.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.520]   Up until a few years ago, this was pretty much what we knew. Studying music as a child was
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.320]   thought to be essential to having perfect pitch, and growing up speaking a tonal language increased
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.920]   your odds of having perfect pitch. Scientists could not say with certainty whether perfect
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.960]   pitch was an innate talent, but they knew that if it was a gift, it was a gift that
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.880]   only appeared among those people who had received some training in pitch in childhood. In other
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:36.080]   words, it would have to be some sort of use-it-or-lose-it gift. Even the lucky few people
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.160]   who are born with a gift for perfect pitch would have to do something, in particular some sort of
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.680]   musical training while young to develop it. We now know that this isn't the case either.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.240]   The true character of perfect pitch was revealed in 2014, thanks to a beautiful experiment carried
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   out at Ichionkai Music School in Tokyo and reported in the scientific journal Psychology of Music.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:08.240]   The Japanese psychologist Ayako Sakakibara recruited 24 children between the ages of 2 and 6
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.040]   and put them through a months-long training course designed to teach them to identify,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.360]   simply by their sound, various chords played on the piano. The chords were all major chords with
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.880]   three notes, such as C major chord with middle C and the E and G notes immediately above middle C.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.240]   The children were given four or five short training sessions per day, each lasting just a
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.600]   few minutes, and each child continued training until he or she could identify all 14 of the
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.360]   target chords that Sakakibara had selected. Some of the children completed the training in less
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.240]   than a year, while others took as long as a year and a half. Then, once a child had learned to
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:52.160]   identify the 14 chords, Sakakibara tested that child to see if he or she could correctly name
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.400]   individual notes. After completing training, every one of the children in the study had
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.320]   developed perfect pitch and could identify individual notes played on the piano.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:07.840]   This is an astonishing result. While in normal circumstances only one in every 10,000 people
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.600]   develops perfect pitch, every single one of Sakakibara's students did. The clear implication
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.880]   is that perfect pitch, far from being a gift bestowed upon a lucky few, is an ability that
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.240]   pretty much anyone can develop with the right exposure and training. The study has completely
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.480]   rewritten our understanding of perfect pitch. So, what about Mozart's perfect pitch? A little
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.280]   investigation into his background gives us a pretty good idea of what happened. Wolfgang's
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.560]   father, Leopold Mozart, was a moderately talented violinist and composer, who had never had the
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.520]   degree of success he desired, so he set out to turn his children into the sort of musicians he
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.680]   himself had always wanted to be. He began with Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna, who by the
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.440]   time she was 11 was described by contemporaries as playing the piano and harpsichord as well as
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.040]   professional adult musicians. The elder Mozart, who wrote the first training book for children's
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.080]   musical development, began working with Wolfgang at an even younger age than he had started with
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.960]   Maria Anna. By the time Wolfgang was four, his father was working with him full-time,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.640]   on the violin, the keyboard, and more. While we don't know exactly what exercises Mozart's father
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.440]   used to train his son, we do know that by the time Mozart was six or seven, he had trained far
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.240]   more intensely and for far longer than the two dozen children who developed perfect pitch through
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.840]   Sakakibara's practice sessions. In retrospect, then, there should be nothing at all surprising
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.520]   about Mozart's development of perfect pitch. So, did the seven-year-old Wolfgang have a gift for
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.920]   perfect pitch? Yes and no. Was he born with some rare genetic endowment that allowed him to identify
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.280]   the precise pitch of a piano note or a whistling tea kettle? Everything that scientists have
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.800]   learned about perfect pitch says no. Indeed, if Mozart had been raised in some other family without
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.520]   exposure to music, or without enough of the right sort of exposure, he would certainly have never
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.720]   developed that ability at all. Nonetheless, Mozart was indeed born with a gift, and it was the same
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:12.000]   gift that the children in Sakakibara's study were born with. They were all endowed with a brain so
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.960]   flexible and adaptable that it could, with the right sort of training, develop a capability that
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:24.000]   seems quite magical to those of us who do not possess it. In short, perfect pitch is not the
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.480]   gift, but rather, the ability to develop perfect pitch is the gift, and as nearly as we can tell,
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:40.880]   pretty much everyone is born with that gift. Now, the author goes on and, as I said, gives many
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:49.120]   interesting examples, but one of the most important ones to me was his demonstration of the fact
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.480]   that when you start learning, one of the most magical things is that when you start learning
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:01.280]   and developing in a certain area, you actually develop new physical traits, new physical
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:08.880]   abilities that make it easier for you to learn more. So, I would call this an example of what
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.760]   they call the Matthew Principle. Those who have will be given more, and those who have not, even
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:20.480]   what they do not have will be taken from them. Because when you do something, your brain actually
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:28.000]   physically adapts to that thing that you're doing. My favorite example of this was in the book Peak.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.120]   Erickson gives the example of London cab drivers, and he shows how, evidently, in London, there's a
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.720]   very—to be a London cabbie is not an easy thing. There's a significant training and apprenticeship
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.640]   program. There's a very significant set of tests that the cab drivers have to pass before they're
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:53.120]   allowed to be an official London cabbie, and the tests involve them learning, basically, the city
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.160]   like the back of their hands. And so, neuroscientists and researchers started to study
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.480]   London cab drivers, and they worked through all of the questions relating to the London cab driver's
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   ability. They discovered that the physical makeup of London cab drivers, in terms of their basic
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.840]   structure of their brain, how the gray matter of their brain is put together, is markedly different
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:25.280]   from a non-cab driver, and that the cab drivers all have this difference in their brain. So then
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.600]   they set out to say, "Well, are people with this difference in their brain actually just selecting
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   themselves to be cab drivers, or is it the cab driving itself and the navigational skills that
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.880]   are building this ability?" And so, they went on in the book, and they talked about all the studies,
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:50.640]   and they did all of the studies to answer all of the questions about what people's brains are like
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.960]   before they start being a London cab driver, and then what people's brains are like after they
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.040]   become a London cab driver. And it shows that their brains change for it. They did all the tests to
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   make sure that the science was good. And what the science demonstrated was that becoming a cab
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:15.920]   driver causes your brain to change and to adapt in terms of its skills of navigation. And he also
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.880]   cited other research that has been done showing the same thing that happens in other areas.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   Mathematicians' brains are different from non-mathematicians' brains. Musicians' brains
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.680]   are different than non-musicians' brains, even to the point of if you're a violinist,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.800]   your brain is different because you will use generally your left hand to control the actual
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   note placement. So, your brain is going to be different from someone else who is an instrument,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.040]   who's a musician, but doesn't use his left hand in playing his instrument.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.600]   And this is really powerful because it demonstrates that when we do something,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:57.520]   not only do we get better at it in the natural process of practice makes perfect, but rather,
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:06.320]   we become more physically capable of getting better at it. Our brains and our bodies adapt
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.200]   to the task that we are putting upon them so that we have more physical resources to
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.920]   apply to the specific task. And there doesn't seem to be a limit to it.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:25.680]   That concept is amazing to me. And to see him lay it out in a very systematic way,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.040]   really, I found extraordinarily persuasive, just enormously persuasive. And when he laid out
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.760]   the ideas of how to do it, then we see its impact in society.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.920]   Now, he spends a lot of time in the book talking about deliberate practice.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.480]   Later, after reading the book, I realized that I had been seeing the term "deliberate practice"
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.200]   in many other places, and I'd been seeing his research cited. I just wasn't cluing into it
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.640]   as I am now. And in essence, this is just my layman version of it. Deliberate practice is a
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:11.200]   little bit hard to define, but what I think of it is simply as a purposefully improving the things
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:19.440]   that you're not—purposely improving the things that were at the edge under expert coaching and
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.800]   expert supervision. So, let me give an example. We can divide practice into different kinds of
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.320]   practice. Anderson talks about, I think, naive practice and purposeful practice and deliberate
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:36.560]   practice. So, naive practice is what most of us do. We just kind of go through the motions when
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.880]   we're doing something, and we just do it the same way that we've always done it. We hit the golf
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.800]   ball the same way we've always hit the golf ball. And what is unique about naive practice is that
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.960]   you don't actually get better, or at least you don't get better in a measurable, predictable way.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.520]   The example I like to use of this is driving. By the time you reach, say, 30 years old, you've been
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.920]   driving a car for many, many years, and you've probably driven for many, many hours. You're
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:11.600]   going to continue in your life driving for many, many more hours and many, many years. But on the
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:19.760]   whole, just because you're driving your car more, your actual driving skills are not getting better.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.360]   The average 50-year-old is not a more competent driver than the average 20-year-old. They're kind
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.920]   of about the same. Why? Well, because when we drive, we're basically always on automatic mode.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.800]   We just get in and we go, and we don't change anything, and we're not actually getting better.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.320]   And so, this is what most of us do in most parts of our life. We just do the same thing. We play
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.240]   the game the same way we've always done it. We practice music that we already know how to play.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.960]   We cook and make the same recipes we've already had. We're not getting better because we're not
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.840]   improving or challenging ourselves. Once we reach that, what we perceive to be an acceptable level
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.440]   of performance, then additional hours of practice don't lead to any improvement.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:16.080]   So, then we could go to purposeful practice. And purposeful practice is
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:23.760]   closer to deliberate practice, where we are specifically trying to improve in a certain way.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   So, if we're playing music, we're trying to play a certain piece of music through
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.240]   without any mistakes multiple times in a row. Or we're trying to specifically work on a certain
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:41.360]   technique that is necessary for our ping pong game. And so, here we are actually getting better.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.960]   We're focusing, we're getting feedback, and we're genuinely getting better. And purposeful practice
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:57.120]   is effective at making us better, but it's not enough. What we need for true deliberate practice,
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:06.800]   the most important aspect, is we need to be improving in a field that is well-defined,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.720]   where the skills and the outcomes are known by the experts. The structure of the field is
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.760]   well-defined. And we need to have a teacher who can give us specific practice activities
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:27.600]   that will help us to cross over the roadblocks that are in our face. And the idea is that with
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:34.880]   these, we can focus on that specific core set of skills that is hindering our further practice.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.240]   And so, that's the core of deliberate practice. It really is something that can only be done
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.680]   in a field where the skills of success are well-known, and where we can hire and find
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.600]   an excellent coach. Otherwise, we're going to be just doing purposeful practice and
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.640]   making it up ourselves, just like the guy who was memorizing numbers made it up himself.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.760]   What I found so encouraging about this was that it was a broad-scale science-based affirmation
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.520]   of basically what most any motivational speaker has been teaching for many, many years,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.080]   that if someone else has done something, you can do it too, right? Anything you can do,
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.800]   I can do better. I can do anything better than you. Well, it's true if I follow the
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.120]   same practice. So, when we identify experts in a field, we figure out how they became
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.240]   that expert and what was it that made them so good, then we can design practice
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:34.640]   methodologies that will help us to improve. And those practice methodologies are always going
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   to keep us at kind of the cutting edge. The example that I remember, I think it came from
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:45.600]   the book, but that I think about, was a golfer. If you're a pro golfer, then one of the things
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:52.640]   that you're working on is your skill is the kinds of skills that very rarely will anyone else need.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.680]   So, I guess we go to Tiger Woods as an example, right? This guy that we all understand is an
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:06.800]   amazing golfer. When Tiger Woods is practicing, he's not sitting around and practicing his drive
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.880]   off of the tee. That's not where he needs practice. He has a perfect drive, he's practiced
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.320]   it a bazillion times, and there's no need for any further practice of that. But what a guy like him
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:25.360]   needs to do is practice the very extreme skills. So, in one of the books, it was talked about how
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:31.040]   a golfer will go out to a sandpit and will systematically sink balls into the sandpit and
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:38.160]   try to shoot very hard shots out of the sandpit. That's something and create just crazy stuff,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.240]   put the ball in, step on it, put it down under and do this. And those are skills that are really
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.840]   important, but they're really only important, say, once a year or once every couple of years.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.280]   But yet in that moment when you're playing the game and you've hit the ball into the sandpit,
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:02.320]   the fact that you've practiced this tiny skill hundreds or thousands of times means that there's
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:09.520]   a much greater likelihood that that one shot that you make once a year will lead to your having the
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.400]   winning score. And in the expert level, that's what it is. It's always these tiny little things
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.760]   that are at the very margin, but that's where your practice has to focus on. So, the concept
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:25.440]   of deliberate practice is enormously freeing and motivating because it means that I can put together
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   a way to improve that's appropriate for me. I can do anything that I want to do. I can build
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:40.320]   a practice strategy that allows me to accomplish anything that I'm looking to accomplish.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   The ultimate vindication of this would have to do, as a kind of a scientific theory,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:56.320]   it would really be vindicated if we could predict in advance who's going to be an expert and know
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.440]   that it's not kind of an accident that it happens. And the most powerful story that you'll hear
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.840]   repeatedly when you start getting into this area of research has to do with a man named
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.400]   Laszlo Polgar and his wife and three daughters. Let me read you a little bit of the story.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:17.600]   In the late 1960s, the Hungarian psychologist Laszlo Polgar and his wife Clara embarked on a
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.120]   grand experiment that would consume their lives for the next quarter century. Laszlo had studied
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:28.720]   hundreds of people who were considered geniuses in one field or another, and he'd concluded that
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:34.320]   with the proper rearing, any child could be turned into a genius. When he was wooing Clara,
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.680]   he outlined his theories and explained that he was looking for a wife who would collaborate with him
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:46.000]   to test his theories on their own children. Clara, a teacher from Ukraine, must have been a very
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.360]   special woman, for she responded positively to this unorthodox courtship and agreed to Laszlo's
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.720]   proposals for marriage and for turning their future children into geniuses. Laszlo was so
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.760]   sure his training program would work for any area that he wasn't picky about which particular one
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:07.120]   he and Clara would target, and the two of them discussed various options. Languages were one
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.840]   option. Just how many languages might it be possible to teach a child? Mathematics was
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.400]   another possibility. Top-flight mathematicians were highly regarded in Eastern Europe at the
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.360]   time, as the communist regime sought ways to prove their superiority over the decadent West.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.480]   Mathematics would have the added advantage that there were no top-level female mathematicians
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.040]   at the time, so assuming that he and Clara had a daughter, Laszlo would prove his claims even
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   more convincingly. But he and Clara settled on the third option. "We could do the same thing
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.320]   with any subject. If you start early, spend lots of time and give great love to that one subject,"
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.080]   Clara would later tell a newspaper reporter. "But we chose chess. Chess is very objective
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:54.000]   and easy to measure." Chess had always been thought of as a game for the male mind, with
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.560]   female chess players treated as second-class citizens. The women had their own tournaments
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.960]   and championships because it was thought it wouldn't be fair to put them up against the men,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.680]   and there had never been a female grandmaster. Indeed, at the time, the common attitude toward
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.520]   women playing chess was much like Samuel Johnson's famous quote, "A woman's preaching is like a dog's
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.560]   walking on his hind legs. It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all."
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:25.200]   The Polgars were blessed with three children, all of them girls. All the better to prove Laszlo's
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:33.120]   point. Their first daughter, born in April 1969, was named Susan (in Hungarian, Susana). Sophia
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.400]   followed in November 1974, and then Judith in July 1976. Laszlo and Clara homeschooled their
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.120]   daughters in order to spend as much time as possible focusing on chess. It didn't take long
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:51.280]   for the Polgars' experiment to become a tremendous success. Susan was just four years old when she
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.480]   won her first tournament, dominating the Budapest Girls Under Eleven Championship with ten wins,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:02.160]   no losses, and no ties. At 15, she became the top-ranked woman chess player in the world,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.720]   and she went on to become the first woman to be awarded grandmaster status via the same path that
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.680]   the males must take. Two other women had been named grandmasters after winning female-only
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.840]   world championships. And Susan wouldn't even be the most accomplished of the girls.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.120]   Sophia, the second daughter, also had an amazing chess career. Perhaps its highlight came when
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.640]   she was only 14, when she dominated a tournament in Rome that included several highly-regarded
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.640]   male grandmasters. By winning eight of her nine games and drawing the ninth, she earned a single
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:41.520]   tournament chess rating (that is, a rating based only on the games of that tournament) of 2,735,
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.240]   which was one of the highest tournament ratings ever for either a male or female player.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.320]   That was in 1989, and people in the chess world still talk about "the sack of Rome."
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:59.840]   Although Sophia's highest overall chess rating was 2,540, well over the 2,500 threshold for
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.400]   grandmaster, and although she had performed more than well enough in sanctioned tournaments,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.360]   she was never awarded grandmaster status, a result that was apparently more a political
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.320]   decision than a judgment about her chess prowess. Like her sisters, she never tried to make nice
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:20.160]   with the male chess establishment. Sophia was at one time the sixth-ranked female chess player in
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.960]   the world. Among the Polgar sisters, though, she could be considered the "slacker."
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:31.360]   Judith was the crown jewel of Laszlo Polgar's experiment. She became a grandmaster at 15
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:38.080]   years, 5 months, making her, at that time, the youngest person, male or female, to ever reach
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.360]   that level. She was the number one-ranked women's chess player in the world for 25 years until she
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.680]   retired from chess in 2014. At one time, she was ranked number eight in the world among all chess
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:56.800]   players, male or female, and in 2005, she became the first, and so far only, woman to play in the
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:03.520]   overall world chess championship. The Polgar sisters were all clearly experts. Each of them
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:09.120]   became among the very best in the world in an area in which the measured performance is extremely
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:15.040]   objective. There are no style points in chess. Your school background doesn't matter. Your resume
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.720]   doesn't count. So we know, without any doubts, just how good they were. And they were very,
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:26.320]   very good. And while some details of their background are unusual – very few parents
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.720]   are so focused on turning their children into the best in the world at something – they provide a
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:36.000]   clear, if somewhat extreme, example of what it takes to become an expert performer. The paths
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.440]   that Susan, Sophia, and Judith took to chess mastery are in line with the path that essentially
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   all experts have taken to become extraordinary. In particular, psychologists have found that an
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.360]   expert's development passes through four distinct stages, from the first glimmers of interest to
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.280]   full-fledged expertise. Everything we know about the Polgar sisters suggests they went through
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.240]   those same stages, if perhaps in a slightly different fashion because of how their father
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.120]   directed their development. And he goes on and talks about the four stages, which are starting
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.760]   out. In the starting out stage, children are introduced in a playful way to what will eventually
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.520]   become their field of interest. And at this stage, the parents of children who are to become experts
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.760]   play a crucial role in the child's development. For one thing, the parents give their children a
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.800]   great deal of time, attention, and encouragement. For another, the parents tend to be very
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:34.000]   achievement-oriented and teach their children such values as self-discipline, hard work,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.760]   responsibility, and spending one's time constructively. And once a child becomes
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.600]   interested in a particular field, he or she is expected to approach it with those same attributes,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.360]   discipline, hard work, achievement. This is a crucial period in a child's development.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.080]   Many children will find some initial motivation to explore or to try something because of their
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.280]   natural curiosity or playfulness. And parents have an opportunity to use this initial interest as a
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.960]   springboard to an activity. But that initial curiosity-driven motivation needs to be
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.080]   supplemented. One excellent supplement, particularly with smaller children, is praise.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.600]   Another motivation is the satisfaction of having developed a certain skill,
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.560]   particularly if that achievement is acknowledged by a parent. Once a child can consistently hit
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.360]   a ball with a bat, say, or play a simple tune on the piano or count the number of eggs in a carton,
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.520]   that achievement becomes a point of pride and serves as motivation for further achievements
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:35.280]   in that area. It goes on, talks about how practice is not such a big part of the initial stage,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.400]   but then in stage two, becoming serious. Once a future expert performer becomes interested
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.200]   and shows some promise in an area, the typical next step is to take lessons from a coach or
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.320]   teacher. At this point, most of these students encounter deliberate practice for the first time.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.840]   Unlike their experiences up to this point, which have been mainly playful activities,
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:02.400]   their practice is about to become work. One of the things that's most interesting about
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:09.360]   the concept of deliberate practice is how hard it is. It's exhausting. The world's greatest
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:15.760]   performers can only engage in deliberate practice, true deliberate practice, for very small quantities
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.480]   of time because that deliberate practice is so exhausting. So it really is hard work.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.120]   So what can parents do? Well, parents can help with motivation.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.200]   Judith has said that her father was the best motivator she had ever met,
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.680]   and this is perhaps the most important factor in the early days of an expert's development,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.160]   maintaining that interest and motivation while the skills and habits are being built.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:46.240]   Parents have an important role to play as well. Parents help their children establish routines,
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.160]   say, practicing the piano for an hour each day, and they give them support and encouragement and
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:59.200]   praise them for improvements. Some parents of Bloom's future experts had to resort to tactics
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:04.240]   like threatening to cut off piano lessons and sell the piano or to no longer take the child
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:10.160]   to swim practice. Obviously, all of the future expert performers decided at this juncture that
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.800]   they wanted to keep going. Others might choose otherwise. While there are various ways that
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.080]   parents and teachers can motivate children, the motivation must ultimately be something
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:25.120]   that comes from within the child or else it won't endure. And the author talks about other ways to
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   accomplish that. The third phase is commitment. Generally, when they're in their early or mid
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.840]   teens, the future experts make a major commitment to becoming the best that they can be. This
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:41.120]   commitment is the third stage. Now, students will often seek out the best teachers or schools for
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:46.000]   their training, even if it requires moving across country. In most cases, that teacher will be
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.320]   someone who has reached the highest levels in the field him or herself, a concert pianist-turned
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.680]   teacher, a swimming coach who has trained Olympic athletes, a top research mathematician, and so on.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.080]   It is generally not easy to be accepted into these programs, and acceptance means that the teacher
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:06.560]   shares the student's belief that he or she can reach the highest levels. Here, the author talks
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   about the benefits of starting young. In Bloom's study, all 120 experts had become their climb
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.760]   toward that pinnacle as children, which is typical among expert performers. But people
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.000]   frequently ask me what the possibilities are for someone who doesn't begin training until later in
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.080]   life. While the specific details vary by field, there are relatively few absolute limitations on
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.880]   what is possible for people who begin training as adults. Indeed, the practical limitations,
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.440]   such as the fact that few adults have four to five hours a day to devote to deliberate practice,
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:44.080]   are often more of an issue than any physical or mental limitations. However, expertise in some
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:51.120]   fields is simply unattainable for anyone who doesn't start training as a child. Understanding
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.720]   such limitations can help you decide which areas you might wish to pursue.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.680]   The most obvious performance issues are those that involve physical abilities.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.640]   In the general population, physical performance peaks around age 20. With increasing age,
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.000]   we lose flexibility. We become more prone to injury and we take longer to heal. We slow down.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.440]   Athletes typically attain their peak performance sometime during their 20s. Professional athletes
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.920]   can remain competitive in their 30s or even early 40s with recent advances in training.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.280]   In fact, people can train effectively well into their 80s. Much of the age-related deterioration
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:30.640]   in various skills happens because people decrease or stop their training. Older people who continue
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:35.680]   to train regularly see their performance decrease much less. There are master's divisions in track
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.320]   and field competition with age brackets up to 80 and beyond. And the people who train for these
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.920]   events do so in precisely the same way that people who are decades younger do. They just train for
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.400]   shorter periods with less intensity because of the increased risk of injury and the increased
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.520]   amount of time the body takes to recover from training. Now, in addition to the gradual
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.440]   deterioration in physical abilities that accompanies aging, some physical skills
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.600]   simply cannot be developed to expert levels if one doesn't start working on them in childhood.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:11.200]   The human body is growing and developing through adolescence up to the late teens or early 20s.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.720]   But once we hit 20 or so, our skeletal structure is mostly set, which has implications for certain
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.840]   abilities. For example, if ballet dancers are to develop the classic turnout, the ability to
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.800]   rotate the entire leg, beginning at the hip, so that it points directly to the side, they must
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.760]   start early. If they wait until after their hip and knee joints calcify, which typically happens
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.280]   between the ages of 8 and 12 years, they'll probably never be able to get a full turnout.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.440]   The same sort of thing is true for the shoulders of athletes, like baseball pitchers,
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.320]   whose sport requires them to throw a ball with an overhead motion. Only those who start training at
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.800]   an early age will have the requisite range of motion as adults, with the throwing arm able
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.000]   to be stretched well back behind the shoulder to produce the classic windup. And something similar
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.600]   holds true with the motion tennis players use when serving. Only those who start young have the full
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.040]   range of the serving motion. Professional tennis players who start young also overdevelop the
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.320]   forearm they use to handle the racket. Not just the muscles, but the bones as well. The bones in
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:18.240]   a tennis player's dominant arm can be 20% thicker than the bones in his or her other arm, a huge
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:23.280]   difference that allows the bones in the dominant arm to endure the steady jolting that comes with
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.640]   hitting a tennis ball that may be traveling as fast as 50 miles per hour. However, even tennis
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.240]   players who start later in life, in their 20s, still can adapt to some degree, but just not as
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.720]   much as those who start younger. In other words, our bones retain their ability to change in
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:44.000]   response to stress well beyond puberty. We witness this pattern again and again when we examine the
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.200]   relationship between age and the body's ability to adapt to stresses or other stimuli. The body
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.120]   and the brain both are more adaptable during childhood and adolescence than they are in
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.600]   adulthood, but in most ways they remain adaptable to some degree throughout life.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.360]   The relationship between age and adaptability varies considerably according to exactly which
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   characteristic you have in mind, and the patterns are very different for mental adaptations than for
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.800]   physical ones. Consider the various ways that musical training can affect the brain. Studies
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.440]   have shown that some parts of the brain are larger in musicians than in non-musicians,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.600]   but there are certain parts of the brain for which this is true only if the musician began
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.240]   studying music as a young child. Researchers have found proof of this, for example, in the
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.960]   corpus callosum, the collection of tissue that connects the brain's hemispheres and serves as
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.400]   the communications path between them. The corpus callosum is significantly larger in adult musicians
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.240]   than in adult non-musicians, but a closer look finds that it is really only larger in musicians
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.080]   who started practicing before they were seven. A different example a couple pages later. Consider
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.560]   what happens to the brain when it learns multiple languages. It is well known that people who speak
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:00.000]   two or more languages have more gray matter in certain parts of the brain, in particular the
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.160]   inferior parietal cortex, which is known to play a role in language, and that the earlier a person
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.680]   learned a second language, the more extra gray matter there is. To everyone else this is a desk,
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:19.360]   but to you it's an entrepeneur, your starting block. You're saying a desk? This is opportunity.

[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.240]   Thus, learning languages early in life takes place, it seems, at least in part,
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.120]   through adding gray matter. But a study of multilingual people who as adults studied to
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.640]   become simultaneous interpreters found a very different effect on the brain. These simultaneous
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:59.280]   interpreters actually had less gray matter than people who could speak the same number of languages
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.840]   but who didn't work as simultaneous interpreters. The researchers who carried out the study
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.080]   speculated that this disparity was because of the different contexts in which the learning took
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:13.440]   place. When children and adolescents learn new languages, it is against the backdrop of increasing
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.000]   gray matter, and so their learning the additional languages may occur through the addition of gray
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.480]   matter. But when adults continue their focus on multiple languages, this time with an emphasis
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:29.680]   on simultaneous translation, it is against a backdrop of pruning synapses. Fascinating to
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.600]   dig into. I hope I'm whetting your appetite on the book. I need to go back and reread it
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.840]   because it's just so good. And this leads to kind of the final question that the book addresses,
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:49.280]   which is, what about natural talent? Whenever I write or speak about deliberate practice and
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:55.360]   expertise, I am invariably asked, but what about natural talent? In my articles and my talks,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:01.280]   I always offer the same basic message that I have here. Expert performers develop their
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:07.360]   extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step-by-step
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:13.680]   in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts. Various sorts of practice can be
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.120]   effective, but the most effective of all is deliberate practice. Deliberate practice takes
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.920]   advantage of the natural adaptability of the human brain and body to create new abilities.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.880]   Most of these abilities are created with the help of detailed mental representations,
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.080]   which allow us to analyze and respond to situations much more effectively than we could
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.200]   otherwise. "Fine," some people will reply, "we understand all that. But even so, aren't there
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.680]   some people who don't have to work as hard and can still be better than everyone else? And aren't
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.560]   there some people who are born without any talent for something, say music or math or sports,
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.760]   so that no matter how hard they try, they'll never be any good at it?"
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.880]   It is one of the most enduring and deep-seated of all beliefs about human nature
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.320]   that natural talent plays a major role in determining ability. This belief holds that
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.480]   some people are born with natural endowments that make it easier for them to become
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.120]   outstanding athletes or musicians or chess players or writers or mathematicians or whatever.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:17.280]   While they may still need a certain amount of practice to develop their skills, they need far
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.840]   less than others who are not as talented, and they can ultimately reach much greater heights.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:27.600]   My studies of experts point to quite a different explanation of why some people ultimately develop
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:33.120]   greater abilities in an area than others, with deliberate practice playing the starring role.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:38.400]   So let's separate myth from reality by exploring the intertwined roles of talent and training in
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.120]   the development of extraordinary abilities. As we'll see, innate characteristics play a much
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:49.440]   smaller and much different role than many people generally assume. Now, you can go on and read
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:57.280]   about the magic of Paganini as his example, and Mozart and others, including he gives a story of
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:03.600]   the magical high jumper of Donald Thomas, cited in the book The Sports Gene, talks about various
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:10.720]   savants. But at the end of the day, the basic lesson that Erickson tries to teach is that
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:21.680]   genetic ability or talent, innate talent, is not the key factor that leads to the long-term outcome.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:28.880]   Now, this is not without controversy. In fact, I'm quite interested myself in these areas of
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:36.800]   controversy. I would say the two areas of the greatest controversy would have to do with innate
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.680]   genetics, especially related to areas like athletic performance, and as well as innate
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:51.360]   characteristics as measured by IQ. Now, there is an enormous and robust and very vitriolic debate
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:49:01.760]   around the topic of IQ. Is someone's natural IQ a determinative factor in life outcomes?
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.960]   This is one of the most hotly debated areas that I know of in the social sciences, where it's
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.480]   actually basically forbidden to debate it, because people say, "Well, if you categorize people based
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:20.640]   upon their natural IQ, then that's unfair, and it's not leading to the long-term outcome." So,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.920]   if you basically want to destroy your potential for a noted, illustrious career, start becoming
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.640]   an IQ researcher. I don't have the competence to actually assess this. I don't know enough about
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.080]   the literature. I don't understand it. I don't have the competence to hold a position on this,
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.640]   so I don't have a position on it. What's fascinating is if you start looking into IQ,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:50.160]   there are a number of studies that demonstrate how the enormous predictive value of somebody's IQ in
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:57.120]   terms of their long-term life outcomes, and we can see all kinds of evidence that IQ seems to be
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:04.160]   persuasive. At least constrained to this subject of genius, Erickson touches on this,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.920]   and he talks about the fact that the impact of IQ is measurable,
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   but not determinative of ultimate performance. Let me read you just a
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.320]   short example when he's talking about chess players. "Perhaps the best example we have of
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.920]   this comes from chess. In the popular imagination, great skill in chess is intimately tied to
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:37.760]   tremendous logic and intellect. If an author or screenwriter wishes to signal that a character is
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.080]   particularly brilliant, that character will be seated at a chessboard and will checkmate his or
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.040]   her opponent with the proper savoir-faire. Even better, this genius will come across a game
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.680]   already in progress and, after glancing at the board for a second or two, point out the winning
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.800]   line of play. Quite often the chess player is a quirky but brilliant detective or perhaps the
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:01.440]   equally quirky and almost equally brilliant criminal mastermind, or preferably both,
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.760]   so that the opponents can face each other across the board, matching wits and trading witticisms.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:12.400]   Sometimes, as in the climactic scene in the 2011 movie A Game of Shadows with Sherlock Holmes and
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:17.360]   Professor Moriarty, the two of them end up ignoring the chessboard altogether and just spit
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.840]   out their moves at each other like two boxers fainting and jabbing until one lands the knockout
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:28.480]   punch. But no matter the circumstances, the message is always the same. A mastery of chess signals the
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:34.400]   sort of deep intelligence that only a few are fortunate enough to be born with. And conversely,
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   playing chess brilliantly demands a brilliant mind. And if you examine chess-playing ability
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   in children who are just learning to play, those with higher IQs do indeed become better players
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.960]   faster. But that is just the beginning of the story. And it is the end of the story that truly
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:58.240]   tells the tale. Over the years, many researchers have examined the connection between intelligence
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.600]   and chess-playing ability. Some of the earliest work was done in the 1890s by Alfred Bennett,
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.320]   the father of intelligence testing, who studied chess players mainly in an attempt to understand
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:14.720]   what sort of memory was required to play blindfold chess. Bennett developed his IQ test as a method
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.520]   of identifying students who had problems doing well in school. And indeed, he succeeded,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.440]   as IQ tests are very much correlated with academic success. But since Bennett's time,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.920]   many researchers have argued that the IQ test measures general abilities that are correlated
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.280]   with success in virtually any domain, such as music and chess. These researchers thus
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:41.760]   believe that IQ tests measure some sort of general innate intelligence. Others disagree, however,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.560]   and argue that IQ is best thought of not as innate intelligence, but rather simply as what IQ tests
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.640]   measure, which can include such things as knowledge about relatively rare words and
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.520]   acquired skills in mathematics. Without delving deeply into that debate, I will just say that I
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:03.600]   think it is best to not equate IQ with innate intelligence, but simply to stick with the facts
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   and think of IQ as some cognitive factor measured by IQ tests that has been shown to predict certain
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:17.200]   things, such as success in school. It goes on and talks about chess then, and here is the relevant
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.400]   section. But these studies were done in young chess players, and while they found that these
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:28.000]   young players did have higher than average IQ scores, there was no clear relationship between IQ
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.200]   and how good a particular player was. By contrast, studies done in adults have generally found adult
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:38.880]   chess players to have no better visuospatial abilities than normal non-chess playing adults.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:44.640]   Research has also shown that skilled adult chess players, even grandmasters, do not have
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:50.640]   systematically higher IQs than other adults with similar levels of education, nor is there any
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.880]   correlation between the IQs of highly skilled chess players and their chess ratings. As strange
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.800]   as it seems to those of us who have grown up with the tortured but brilliant fictional characters
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:06.560]   who excel at chess, all of the evidence says that higher intelligence is not correlated
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:12.000]   with better chess playing among adults. Even stranger is the case of Go, which has been often
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.360]   referred to as the Asian version of chess. It talks about what the game is. While there's only
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.440]   one type of piece and only one type of move, putting a stone at an intersection point, the
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.840]   game is actually more complex than chess in the sense that there are far more different possible
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.880]   games that can be played, and indeed it has proved far more challenging than chess to develop
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   software to play the game well. Unlike the best chess playing computer programs, which can
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   consistently beat chess grandmasters, the best Go programs, at least as this is written in 2015,
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.360]   cannot stand up to top-ranked Go players. Thus, as with chess, you might assume that Go masters
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:55.920]   must have high IQs or perhaps exceptional visuospatial skills. But again, you would be
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:03.680]   wrong. Recent studies of Go masters have found that their average IQ is, if anything, below
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:09.040]   average. Two separate studies of Korean Go experts found an average IQ of about 93,
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   compared with control groups of non-Go playing Koreans matched for age and sex, which had an
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:19.600]   average IQ around 100. While the number of Go masters in the two studies were small enough
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.560]   that the below average IQs could have just been statistical flukes, it is clear that Go masters,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:29.680]   on average, score no higher on IQ tests than people in the general population.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:34.480]   Against this background, the three British researchers set out to resolve the conflicting
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.240]   results on chess players. Does a higher intelligence, that is, a higher IQ score,
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.880]   help one develop a better chess game or not? The researchers' plan was to do a study that
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:50.800]   took into account both intelligence and practice time. Earlier studies had looked at one or the
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:56.880]   other but not both. It goes around and explains how the research was identified. When the
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:02.080]   researchers analyzed all their data, they found results similar to those seen by other researchers.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.040]   The amount of chess practice that the children had done was the biggest factor in explaining
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:12.160]   how well they played chess, with more practice being correlated with better scores on the various
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.680]   measures of chess skill. A smaller but still significant factor was intelligence, with higher
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.280]   IQ being related to better chess skills. Surprisingly, visuospatial intelligence wasn't
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.840]   the most important factor, but rather memory and processing speed were. Looking at all their
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.560]   evidence, the researchers concluded that in children of this age, practice is the key factor
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:39.040]   in success, although innate intelligence, or IQ, still plays a role. The picture changed
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:44.160]   dramatically, however, when the researchers looked at only the elite players in the group.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:50.080]   These were 23 children, all boys. The show talks about their elite skills. Among these 23 elite
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.720]   players, the amount of practice was still the major factor determining their chess skills,
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:01.760]   but intelligence played no noticeable role. While the elite group did have a somewhat higher average
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:08.160]   IQ than the average IQ for the entire group of 57, the players in the elite group with lower IQs were,
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.080]   on average, slightly better players than those in the elite group with high IQ.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:17.680]   Stop and digest that for a moment. Among these young, elite chess players,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:22.640]   not only was a higher IQ no advantage, but it seemed to put them at a slight disadvantage.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:29.680]   The reason, the researchers found, was that the elite players with lower IQs tended to practice
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   more, which improved their chess game to the point that they played better than the high IQ
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.560]   elite players. Now, the author goes on and expands the actual research on this
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:47.760]   more, and it's so fascinating. But consider this. If you see yourself as, if you see or are,
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.440]   if you're genuinely not as skilled in an area as someone else is naturally in that area,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.920]   and if you practice more, there's a good chance that your additional amounts of practice
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.400]   can make up for the other person's innate advantage and superiority over you such
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.760]   that you can beat the other person. That's one of the most powerful, empowering ideas that I
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.520]   can imagine. Now, let's go on to a different section as we wrap up our discussion on this
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.720]   particular book, "The Real Role of Innate Characteristics." The results from the chess
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:26.480]   study provide a crucial insight into the interplay between talent and practice in the development of
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   various skills. While people with certain innate characteristics, IQ in the case of the chess study,
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:37.520]   may have an advantage when first learning a skill, that advantage gets smaller over time
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.240]   and eventually the amount and the quality of practice take on a much larger role in determining
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:47.760]   how skilled a person becomes. Researchers have seen evidence of this pattern in many different
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:54.960]   fields. In music, as in chess, there is an early correlation between IQ and performance. For
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.760]   example, a study of 91 5th grade students who were given piano instruction for six months found that
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:04.480]   on average, the students with higher IQs performed better at the end of those six months than those
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:11.360]   with lower IQs. However, the measured correlation between IQ and music performance gets smaller as
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:17.120]   the years of music study increase, and tests have found no relationship between IQ and music
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:23.440]   performance among music majors in college or among professional musicians. In a study on expertise
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:27.840]   in oral surgery, the performance of dental students was found to be related to their performance on
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:33.200]   tests of visual spatial ability, and the students who scored higher on those tests also performed
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.720]   better on surgical simulations done on the model of a jaw. However, when the same test was done on
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:44.720]   dental residents and dental surgeons, no such correlation was found. Thus, the initial influence
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.000]   of visual spatial ability on surgical performance disappears over time as the dental students
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.200]   practice their skills, and by the time they become residents, the differences in talent,
[00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:01.280]   in this case visual spatial ability, no longer have a noticeable effect. Among the people studying
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.440]   to be London taxi drivers that we discussed in Chapter 2, there was no difference in IQ between
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.920]   the ones who finished the course and became certified drivers and those who dropped out.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.080]   IQ made no difference in how well the drivers could learn to find their way around London.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.480]   The average IQ of scientists is certainly higher than the average IQ of the general population,
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.080]   but among scientists, there is no correlation between IQ and scientific productivity.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.400]   Indeed, a number of Nobel Prize-winning scientists have had IQs that would not even
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.160]   qualify them for MENSA, an organization whose members must have a measured IQ of at least 132,
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.840]   a number that puts you in the upper two percentile of the population.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.640]   Skipping down the discussion of scientists, a number of researchers have suggested that
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.960]   there are, in general, minimum requirements for performing capably in various areas.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   For instance, it has been suggested that scientists in at least some fields need an
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.800]   IQ score of around 110 to 120 to be successful, but that a higher score doesn't confer any
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.720]   additional benefit. However, it is not clear whether that IQ score of 110 is necessary
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.400]   to actually perform the duties of a scientist or simply to get to the point where you can be hired
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.720]   as a scientist. In many scientific fields, you need to hold a Ph.D. to be able to get
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.120]   research grants and conduct research, and getting a Ph.D. requires four to six years
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.760]   of successful postgraduate academic performance, with a high level of writing skills and a large
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.720]   vocabulary, which are essentially attributes measured by verbal intelligence tests.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.360]   Furthermore, most science Ph.D. programs demand mathematical and logical thinking,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.440]   which are measured by other components of intelligence tests. When college graduates
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.240]   apply to graduate school, they have to take such tests as the Graduate Record Examination, GRE,
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.160]   which measure these abilities, and only the high-scoring students are accepted into science
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.880]   graduate programs. Thus, from this perspective, it is not surprising that scientists generally
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.640]   have IQ scores of 110 to 120 or above. Without the ability to achieve such scores, it is unlikely
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.400]   they would have ever had the chance to become scientists in the first place.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.800]   One could also speculate that there are certain "minimum talent" requirements for such things as
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.960]   playing sports or painting, so that people who fall below those requirements would find it
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.640]   difficult or impossible to become highly skilled in those areas. But outside of some very basic
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.760]   physical traits, such as height and body size in sports, we have no solid evidence that such
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:30.080]   minimum requirements exist. We do know, and this is important, that among those people who have
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.680]   practiced enough and have reached a certain level of skill in their chosen field, there is no
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.880]   evidence that any genetically determined abilities play a role in deciding who will be among the best.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:47.600]   Once you get to the top, it isn't natural talent that makes the difference,
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.520]   at least not talent in the way it is usually understood as an innate ability to excel at a
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:02.800]   particular activity. I better stop. He talks about the dark side of believing in talent,
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.520]   which to me, I think, is the most important thing, and talks about where do we go from here.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.560]   The big takeaways that I took from the book is that we can really dramatically improve
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:20.880]   our training methodologies by applying deliberate practice. When I finished reading this book,
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.320]   I took several dozen pages of screenshots and sent them to a friend of mine who's a physician,
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.680]   and basically just pointing out how we can dramatically improve training programs for
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:40.640]   skills. When I take the modern science that is presented by this skilled researcher and I look
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.240]   around, what I see is enormous opportunities for improvement in how we teach and in how we train.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.600]   And I've tried to, this has been kind of one of my interests, is to say, how can I apply
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:00.160]   this modern knowledge that we have to how we teach and how we train? Because all of our
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.680]   training methodologies should involve the basic principles of deliberate practice,
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.960]   and this should be the case in how we teach reading, it should be the case in how we teach
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.400]   mathematics, it should be the case in how we teach sports, it should be the case in how
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   we teach anything. And indeed, I think that we can measure the impact of these ideas across many,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.600]   many fields. If you just look at the Olympics, which are just concluded here in 2024, and you
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.920]   take whatever discipline you're interested in and go back 30 years or 50 years, what you will see
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:39.680]   is that the Olympic performance of a previous competitor who got an Olympic medal in 1970
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.080]   today is basically the average performance of a high-scoring high school athlete, not in any way
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.720]   Olympic-level. And so we've pushed the envelope in so many things, especially physical endeavors,
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.000]   because of our ability to train more effectively. I think in mental endeavors,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.240]   we could argue both sides. One thing I've said in the past is that I said it's just embarrassing
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:17.520]   how we've failed so enormously in making advances in educational abilities. If you go back and you
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.400]   look at a Harvard College entrance exam from the early 20th century, and you compare the
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.160]   amount of knowledge needed by that, and you compare that to today, it's astonishing how
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:33.840]   ignorant our modern generation is. And so I have made the statement that we should dramatically
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:39.920]   improve how we actually teach, because if we're not producing more knowledgeable, more informed
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.320]   graduates today than we were back then, we're failing. I don't agree with that anymore, though.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:51.440]   I think I was wrong in saying that. I don't know how to quantify this. But as I thought about that,
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.640]   I realized that's not the case. Today, we're teaching a much bigger body of knowledge.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:04.960]   If you were to go back to 1900 or 1800 and look at the amount of knowledge that a Harvard entrance,
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.920]   an entering college freshman was expected to know, there was a much deeper level of knowledge,
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:16.720]   especially in the humanities, especially in the classical languages and things like that.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:22.640]   But I think today there's a much bigger body of knowledge that that entering student would know,
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.720]   because today there'll be much more advanced mathematics, much more advanced history,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.080]   much more advanced science. And so I don't think it was right when I previously made those
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:38.560]   statements. But I would love to see somebody quantify that and try to figure it out. Regardless,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.360]   the point remains that we should be incorporating the very best teaching methodologies in teaching
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.440]   these things. And if you're coaching someone, a young person or yourself, you always need to go
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.400]   out and find the best current teaching methodology, because we can and should find ourselves
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.840]   dramatically reducing the amount of time it takes to learn the subjects that we're teaching. And I
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:04.400]   think we can do this and we should do this. This is basically all of my interest in homeschooling.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:10.320]   I have enormously above average interest in these topics, enormously above average resources,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.840]   enormously above average research abilities. And so this is what I do. This is my hobby,
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:19.840]   is I go out and try to find this stuff. And I see good results with the areas that I have
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.520]   adapted this to, and I'm still working to create good results.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.800]   So let's leave the IQ question aside and let the researchers keep working on it. I think the most
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:36.480]   empowering thing that we can take from this book, Peak, and from other expert research is the idea
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:44.080]   that almost anybody with enough time and with the right practice methodology can become a top
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:50.400]   performer. I think this is true. I believe we have good scientific reason to believe that it's true.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.120]   Whether it's actually true, though, in the fullness of time, I think it's metaphorically
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:01.840]   true. I think this is a truth that is so useful to the common human experience that it's something
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:07.200]   that we should believe is true and let the scientists keep on working to prove its truth
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:14.720]   or prove its lack of truth. Nowhere in the book, Peak, does Erickson say that talent does not exist.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.600]   The researchers, as he described it, are open to the idea that innate talent does exist.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   What they say is that innate talent does not predict the outcomes for expert performance.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.840]   Rather, what does predict the outcomes for long-term expert performance is the amount of time,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.480]   the amount of high-quality practice that a person has engaged in in the relevant field,
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.360]   and the actual kind of practice, having the best coaches with the best techniques.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.840]   So I think it's useful for us to set aside the concept of innate talent and focus instead on
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:01.680]   believing that we, in the fullness of time, we have the right practice and the right experience
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.320]   over time. Now, the next book in the trio that I read was a book called Talent is Overrated,
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.960]   What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else by an author named Jeff Colvin.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.280]   Colvin is not a scientist or a researcher. He's a journalist. And yet, his book is really well
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.400]   written, and it goes through and tries to demonstrate exactly what the title says.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.440]   I'll read the blurb. "Why are certain people so incredibly great at what they do?
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.160]   Most of us think we know the answer, but we're almost always wrong. That's important because
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.960]   if we're wrong on this crucial question, then we have zero chance of getting significantly better
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:44.880]   at anything we care about. Happily, the real source of great performance is no longer a mystery.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:50.080]   Bringing together extensive scientific research, best-selling author Jeff Colvin shows where we
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.600]   go wrong and what actually makes world-class performers so remarkable. It isn't specific,
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:02.400]   innate talent, nor is it plain old hard work. It's a very specific type of work that anyone can do,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.360]   but most people don't. What's more, the principles of great performance apply to virtually any
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.640]   activity that matters to you. Readers worldwide have been inspired by this book's liberating
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.760]   message. You don't need a one-in-a-million natural gift. Better performance, and maybe
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.200]   even world-class performance, is closer than you think." I think this book is extremely useful. I
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.400]   didn't like it as much as Peak because I was more interested in the actual scientific research of
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.840]   Erikson, but I think it was very useful. And this book was published many years ago and has been
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.760]   updated, at least with one 10th anniversary edition. It's a good book. What I took away
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:44.960]   from the book was a broader application of concepts. He touched on a lot of things that
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.840]   Erikson himself didn't talk about. Erikson is cited many times in the book, as are many other
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   researchers. And he gave a lot more application of the book. Now, this is where I started to say,
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.720]   "Wait a second. I'm not sure we could go to this application. I'm not sure we should go to this
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   application." The most inspiring application that I found from Talent is Overrated was where the
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.760]   author talked about societal advances and inventions. And what he really took an axe to
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.800]   was the idea that inventors just sit around and come up with brilliant ideas. And he showed how,
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.160]   on the contrary, if you start looking at the history of inventions, most of the breakthrough
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:31.120]   inventions are simply a product of systematic plotting by people taking problems, working at
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:38.720]   those problems, thinking about previous solutions. And there is a basic evolutionary arc that makes
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.720]   sense with regard to most breakthrough inventions. That was what I really took from it that I thought
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.960]   was powerful. So I think that you can take a field that you're working in and you can make
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.200]   dramatic differences in it in a steady, plotting way. You don't have to wait for some kind of
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.640]   brilliant epiphany and flash of inspiration to cause your breakthrough idea to happen.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:04.560]   Where I wasn't on board with the ideas from Talent is Overrated is the author's absolute
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:13.520]   enthusiasm for the idea of causing people to specialize at an early age. So he gave examples
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:19.360]   of, well, if we need a tennis player to start at an early age, like the Williams sisters did,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.680]   then that's going to be amazing. We've created these great athletes, these tennis prodigies
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.800]   and these golf prodigies from all these people who started at an early age. We should do exactly the
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.200]   same thing in business. And we should be training and growing little marketing experts from three
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:41.600]   years old so that by the time they're teens, they're going to be prodigies. And Colvin expanded
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:47.920]   his discussion and his examples that he cited throughout his whole book into the world of
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:54.880]   business and into the world of broader achievement in society, maybe even in politicians.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.960]   Now, what struck me so wrong was this idea that we should have children specialize from such an
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.400]   early age. And I've thought about why did that strike me so wrong? On the one hand, I'm open to
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:13.520]   it. And I think that this is in many ways what has happened in previous civilizations. I've become a
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.680]   great respecter of the concept of aristocracy. Being raised in the democratic ideals of the
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:27.280]   U.S. American milieu, I grew up with a natural disdain for the concepts of aristocracy, monarchy,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:34.800]   things like that. Today, I appreciate those systems much more. If I could move to a monarchy
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.120]   or an aristocracy where the monarchs basically aligned with my values in life, I wouldn't even
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:47.040]   think twice about that. I don't see any huge particular value of democracy. Those are fighting
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:53.680]   words. Don't fight me on it. I'm testing that out, kind of still thinking. But I really question
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:00.080]   if broad-scale democracy is the right solution. I think if we — just let me defend this real
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   quickly because I know such fighting words. If we went back to a system like existed in the early
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   United States without universal suffrage, with some kind of — I don't want to call it a landed
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:19.920]   aristocracy, but let's call it a landed democracy — some kind of a democratic rule of the elites,
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:28.640]   democratic rule of the wealthy, democratic rule of something like that, perhaps that would create
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:36.320]   something better. Maybe we could go to broad-scale republicanism with a republic gathered together
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:44.480]   with some form of democratic system in the states. But I really wish we could get rid of popular
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.680]   elections for senators. I wish senators were simply appointed. I wish we could get rid of
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.440]   all of the popular primary system elections of elections in the United States. I don't see any
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:02.560]   value whatsoever of presidents being elected with a popular vote in a primary system. I would like
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:08.480]   to go back to a system of 150 years ago because the current one just seems utterly stupid in terms
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.960]   of the results that it is creating. And the dangers of populism are so enormous that it's just
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.720]   creating massive problems. So I'm not entirely opposed to democracy, but universal suffrage to
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.560]   me seems an absolute catastrophe. And when you put universal suffrage together with popular elections
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:31.520]   for the people's house, which has always been popular elections, and then also the Senate and
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:37.280]   also the presidency, including the primary system, this just seems like a total catastrophe to me in
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:43.680]   watching the American system. And so if you went back to a monarchy or aristocracy of some kind,
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.560]   and you look at it, the benefit of that was basically specialization from an early age.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.560]   And so if a monarchy is seeing itself as upholding a responsibility, I look at
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:04.560]   Queen Elizabeth, recently deceased Queen Elizabeth, and look at the sense of responsibility
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.240]   that she had, she served as a responsible monarch, a monarch with a vision. And if you went back and
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.800]   studied a little bit of aristocracies where we have access to them, they were expected to live
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.600]   by a code to kind of raise the human spirit. Now, obviously, those weren't perfect systems.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.080]   Obviously, they failed continually. But the point was, that may be an expression of basically early
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:32.560]   specialization. You don't expect the son of a king to go and pursue a scientific career.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.200]   On the contrary, you expect the son of a king to go and pursue a career in the humanities and a
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.640]   career in understanding political science and a career in statesmanship. And I would dearly love
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.920]   to see some actual statesmen emerge within my own home country of the United States as compared to
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.280]   a bunch of crude populist politicians. But leave that aside for a moment. My point was just to
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:59.200]   illustrate that perhaps this concept of being a prince or an aristocrat and being raised in this
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.720]   idea where your life course was charted out for you is actually an example of where we engaged in
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:11.040]   early specialization. And maybe it's not all a bad thing, but it really struck me as crass and wrong
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   to somehow say to an eight-year-old that we're going to train you to be the president of a
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:24.320]   corporation. And I don't know, I can't fully defend that belief. Is that a bad thing? No,
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.320]   probably not a bad thing, but it just still strikes me as wrong. And maybe that's just a
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.800]   cultural artifact. I don't know. I'm still thinking about it. But it's a convenient segue
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.800]   to then the next book, which was the third book in this kind of this trilogy that I read,
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   which was a book called Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World by an author
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.680]   named David Epstein. Now, I really enjoyed Range, and I'm not sure how to fit all these together.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:57.680]   Range, in many ways, was basically an argument against talent is overrated, as well as an
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.320]   argument against other things. It's an argument against grit. When you go through his chapters,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.680]   if you know a little bit about the space, you can basically understand each chapter being an
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.000]   argument against a certain book. And I felt his book was very well written. He gave great examples,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.920]   and he rebutted many of the ideas of talent is overrated, and by extension, honors Erickson by
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:27.360]   giving counter examples. On the whole, I didn't think he disproved anything, but rather provided
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:33.840]   more of a cautionary, hey, maybe hyperspecialization from an early age is not the only thing that
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.040]   matters. What I took away from Range was that there are other factors that are not included
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:47.600]   in exclusively this idea of hyperspecialization from an early age. Some world-class athletes do
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.400]   indeed specialize and become world-class from another early age. Some world-class athletes,
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.520]   on the other hand, don't specialize from an early age. And I think that most of us would nod our
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.640]   heads and say, sure, we can understand that. Somebody who has broad athletic ability could
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.720]   probably succeed in many sports. You don't have to just choose one sport and play it from the age
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:12.480]   of three onward. You could probably have a lot of overlap between these abilities, just like
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.720]   there's overlap in other things. If somebody has learned one foreign language, and they've learned
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:20.160]   it well, there's a pretty decent chance that they could learn another foreign language and learn it
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.840]   well. It's not like there's something magically different about French versus Spanish. They're
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.640]   just different expressions of it. So those cautions were good. What I thought was the
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:35.920]   most interesting in Range was where he talked about how maybe success in a certain area isn't
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:42.240]   always the key factor. So he talked a good bit about the problem of too much grit, for example,
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:49.840]   too much stick-to-itiveness. And he demonstrated how someone sticking to something for a long
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.560]   period of time could indeed be a predictive outcome for that person succeeding in the long
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:01.920]   run. But that doesn't necessarily mean that's the right outcome for the person's life success,
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:08.400]   that in general, trying different things is important to ultimately identify the area where
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.120]   you really want to focus. And I felt like this overview gave me some of the answers I was looking
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.040]   for with my frustration with talent is overrated and this idea of hyper-specialization, that,
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:24.160]   sure, we can see that hyper-specialization can produce a world-class genius, a leader in his
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:30.000]   field, but does that mean that that's actually a good thing? And we don't know, but we shouldn't
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.080]   artificially force people into a certain area without exposing them to the broad range,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.000]   pun intended, of options that are available. The other useful point that I drew from Range
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   was the distinction of what the author calls kind learning environments versus wicked learning
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.200]   environments. I think on my Friday show, I said friendly instead of kind. He uses the word kind.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:58.640]   The basic idea is chess is a great example of a skill that has to be studied and learned.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:03.360]   And so hyper-specialization, like Laszlo Polgar did with his children,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:09.440]   hyper-specialization can lead to an amazing outcome. But that's not because hyper-specialization
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:15.120]   leads to an amazing outcome in every endeavor, but rather because chess is a kind learning
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.240]   environment. That means that the rules are clear and you get immediate feedback on your decisions.
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:26.720]   The environment is very highly structured. And so people who become an expert at chess basically are
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.560]   learning patterns that can be recognized and understood intuitively and responded to quickly
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:37.360]   again and again and again. And all of those patterns are constrained to an orderly world.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:42.640]   All of the pieces have specific rules, specific things they can do, specific things they can't
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.840]   do. And so you can absorb the body of knowledge and develop broad recognition of all of the
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.960]   patterns of the chess game. Other games like golf, where we talk about Tiger Woods and what his
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.760]   father did to train him to be expert. Well, it's a kind environment. The rules are consistent and
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.000]   clear. You get immediate feedback from your results. And so your success in that environment
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.240]   comes from consistently repeating and refining your techniques. But that doesn't describe all
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:13.760]   learning environments. On the contrary, there are wicked learning environments. So doing something
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:19.920]   like being a stock market trader. Well, here we have an enormously wicked environment that's filled
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:26.320]   with complex and unpredictable variables. And the feedback that you get from your decisions,
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.680]   it doesn't necessarily occur immediately. Sometimes it can be just delayed or misleading.
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:37.360]   And what works in one particular situation may not work in another, which makes it very difficult
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.560]   to develop consistent expertise. Once your rules start working and you think you've got it cracked,
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.640]   well, all of a sudden now the market changes. Something changes dramatically. And the rules
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.560]   that worked for a certain amount of time don't seem to work so reliably in other examples,
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:57.200]   in other scenarios. Or he gives examples like emergency medicine or parenting.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:03.360]   If you're in emergency medicine, you have all kinds of situations that are very unpredictable
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.760]   and yet have enormously high stakes. And so what works in one outcome may not necessarily be the
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:16.240]   thing that works in another. And so due to the highly variable environments, what you do changes.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:22.640]   And parenting, there's no clear rules. And sometimes the feedback that you get is
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.320]   ambiguous. You're actually making a difference in the child's life, but the child won't say
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.400]   anything about it. Or it's decades down the road. And so it's hard to look at your three-year-old
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.840]   and say, I'm going to teach you the master list of rules that you need to know to be a great parent
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.760]   so you're going to be a world-class parent by the age of 20. No, that doesn't work. It works in
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:46.880]   chess. It doesn't work in parenting. So that's a really useful model to have in your mind to say,
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:54.560]   what's the difference among these things? And it's a good book because it challenges some of
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.560]   those things. Let me hear for your overall view on the book Range. Let me read this really great
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:06.000]   review from Amazon written by Todd Stark. And he gives the book a five-star review, and this will
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.600]   just be the best, most succinct way to get an idea of the content of the book. "This is a beautifully
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.680]   written and well-justified discussion of the various specific things that are not taken into
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.160]   account by the widespread cultural emphasis on early specialization for success and our popular
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:27.440]   model of performers in terms of domain-specific expertise. This takes the form of a single
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.360]   conclusion, which I would paraphrase as, we need to be able to play and explore widely and to color
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.680]   outside the lines for a while in order to become very good at solving the difficult problems we
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.480]   later encounter. But our cultural obsession with specialization pushes counter to that.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:48.000]   There's a constant tension of the author's confidence in his conclusion that generalists
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.120]   are uniquely valuable and desperately needed, and his recognition that he is fighting an almost
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:58.480]   quixotic uphill battle against powerful cultural trends and incentives for specialization.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:05.120]   What he means by specialization and the factors closely tied to it. One, head start, encouraging
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.560]   children from an early age to narrowly pursue things they seem talented at or have an interest
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:17.520]   in. Two, domain specificity, training with heavy emphasis on the specific narrow range skills we
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.640]   know we will need in the target environment and assuming far transfer of skills from other
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.480]   activities will be limited or non-existent. Three, disciplinary focus, viewing learning as
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.360]   consisting of accumulating facts and theories specific to a particular field or subfield of
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.760]   study in order to become highly skilled at working in that narrow field. Four, persistence, the idea
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.400]   that we should identify a passion early and stick with it no matter what because it's what we're
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:50.480]   good at and enjoy and so can become successful at it if we manage to persist. Five, fast and
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.120]   efficient short-term learning, the assumption that we are learning better when we feel familiar with
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.720]   the material quickly and that we are then learning more efficiently. Against those powerful and
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:05.680]   popular specialization factors, Epstein presents several compelling lines of evidence. One,
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:12.080]   domain specificity varies with kind versus wicked learning. The argument for early specialization
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:17.440]   and domain specificity is based on the observation that we need a long period of deliberate practice
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.400]   to accumulate the patterns and skills specific to performing in that specific area and that
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.040]   practicing or exploring other activities is unlikely to do anything helpful for our performance
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:33.280]   in our specialty. Epstein counters that on closer inspection, we find a crucial distinction between
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.280]   different kinds of domains and learning environments wherein some of them deliberate
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:42.320]   practice reliably makes us better but in others deliberate practice either helps much less or can
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.040]   even make us perform more poorly under some conditions. So not all domains or learning
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.240]   environments are equally specific and the head start is not equally helpful in all activities.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:59.040]   Two, creative performance comes from early exploration and interdisciplinary learning.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.200]   Given the domain specific view of expertise, we tend to assume that in order for someone to
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.480]   perform at a high level in any activity, since they need expertise, they need to specialize
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:14.320]   in that activity. Epstein counters that when we focus specifically on creative performance,
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.880]   we find that deep expertise can be invaluable but is not enough. In order to come up with truly
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.000]   novel solutions to problems, we need to make use of analogies that cross different domains
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.160]   while sharing deep structural similarities. That means being familiar with a wider range of ideas
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.040]   and ways of thinking than just those in our specialty. And so Epstein says creative
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.840]   performance is found more in people with broader backgrounds. Epstein argues that outstanding
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.800]   creative performance also tends to be associated with early exploration of different activities
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:53.440]   more than with early specialization. Three, the efficiency we perceive from narrow
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.960]   immersion is very often illusory. We tend to assume that when we feel more familiar with the
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.160]   activity or material that we are learning it. That's part of the strong intuitive appeal for
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.280]   immersion in an activity comes from. It feels like we're learning more when we're more immersed.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.960]   Epstein argues that the evidence from learning research shows quite often exactly the opposite,
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.640]   that the learning we think we're doing under conditions of immersion is either much less
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.400]   or much shorter lived than we assume. Robert Bjork's concept of desirable difficulty in
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.840]   learning and the evidence base behind it plays a central role in this argument.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.440]   This, Epstein argues, tell us that slow learning, which helps us make new connections between a
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.000]   wider range of experiences, is much more conducive to learning in the long run than
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.200]   fast efficient learning from immersion in a narrow subject matter.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:48.560]   Four, match quality is not necessarily the same as early passion. Part of the argument for early
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.040]   specialization is based on the assumption that people have certain interests and talents from
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.440]   early on. And if they can find something that matches them well and start early,
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.800]   they can align their passion with a successful career in that activity.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.680]   Epstein argues that what we know about lifespan development tells us that people's passions are
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.640]   not so fixed or narrow and finds a number of cases of exceptionally successful people who
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.440]   spent their lives exploring and trying different things before finding a match that was truly
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:21.600]   satisfying and successful for them. Range is an appeal to encourage exploration in our lives from
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:27.680]   early on, and for experimenting and experiencing broadly in our learning, even though it may seem
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:33.520]   to be inefficient or slow. Epstein does not deny the immense value of long, deliberate,
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.600]   specialized practice in "kind" domains, or the value of having deep specialized experience in
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.320]   some areas, but he has also made a passionate and well-argued case for making better use
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:48.720]   of a completely different dimension of performance, a dimension rooted in longer-term
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.760]   developmental outcomes, more exploratory or playful learning, and an ongoing search for
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:58.320]   ever-better matches between our interests and abilities and our activities. I think that's a
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:06.000]   great summary of the book. And in general, these books, to me, seem to merge beautifully, and not
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.440]   actually to be at odds, but more to be a measure of, "Here's the science in this application,
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:18.320]   and then here's how this gets put together." I worry that the book Range is enormously more
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:28.000]   popular than either of these other books. Range on Amazon has 11,420 ratings, Peak has 3,340 ratings,
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:35.680]   and Talent is overrated at 1,980 ratings. I think people are less served, generally,
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.480]   by the message in Range than by the message in the other books, because it seems to me
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.160]   that many people underestimate the value of being able to actually become a world-class genius.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:50.560]   Maybe it's just the circles I'm exposed to, but I hear a lot more people that believe in the
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:57.200]   existence of innate talent and ability as being the determinative factor in someone's long-term
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.320]   outcomes than anything else. You hear this in the IQ perspectives, you hear this in discussions of
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.800]   genetics. People believe this to be the determinative factor, and I don't see the
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:14.800]   evidence for that position being raised. In addition, people underestimate the value of
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:19.200]   deliberate practice. The concept of deliberate practice and the ability to apply it is life
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:24.560]   changing, because it means that you can genuinely develop yourself to be the leader in your career.
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:32.320]   I took away from these books a huge emphasis on my incorporating a deliberate practice routine.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:37.280]   I've basically rested on a lot of my laurels from younger in my life and younger in my career,
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.400]   and I haven't seen some of my skills actually increase in the last
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:47.440]   five years because I'm just engaging in continual naive practice, and I realized I need to be
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:54.320]   continually focused on deliberate practice. I really do. That's an empowering message.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:59.040]   I would like that message to get out into our culture much more than the message from Range,
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.240]   because what it seems like I perceive from Range is that many people who are not familiar with
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:09.120]   these other aspects of research may simply go out in the world and say, "Well, you don't need to
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.960]   focus at all. You don't need to focus on getting better. You just need to go out and have a variety
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:19.680]   of experiences." And I'm in favor of the outcome, but only when it's balanced against the benefit
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.680]   of specialization and benefit of focus. I haven't touched yet on the discussion
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:31.840]   of physical talent and physical abilities. David Epstein wrote another book that I have not read
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.400]   called The Sports Gene, Inside the Science of Extraordinary Athletic Performance.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:43.280]   I have been wanting to read this book very much because it seems to me that if genetic ability
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:50.240]   is the key determining factor, then we should be able to see that generally in sports,
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.520]   more so than in other areas like cognitive ability, where we have the ability to measure
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:03.280]   and we know that the brain adapts, and we should see it in sports. Do we see it? I don't know. I
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:09.120]   hear a lot of people very loudly advocating that we absolutely see it and that your genetic base
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:15.760]   is the key. And it seems obvious to me that genetic base is going to have a significant factor
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.840]   in many areas, but I also am not sure about the other. So, I'd like to get around to that,
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.040]   but I haven't done it yet. Let me tell you what I think we should do as a result of
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:33.120]   what I've described in these books. Number one, I think we should believe ourselves
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:40.880]   and instill the belief in our children and all around us that I can and you can become
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.920]   world-class in any area that you care about enough to really focus on and engage in deliberate
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:53.520]   practice for enough time. The amount of time varies. One thing that's interesting is I used
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.680]   to read Malcolm Gladwell's books, and he has in his book, this book, "Outliers," where he talks
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.040]   about the so-called 10,000-hour rule. And that 10,000-hour rule has become basically commonly
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:10.640]   accepted wisdom in our culture, as best I can tell from "Outliers." But Erickson, whose research was
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.760]   the basic foundation of that 10,000-hour rule, very politely tries to demonstrate how nobody
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:22.240]   understands the 10,000-hour rule because the research of the 10,000-hour rule came from
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:29.120]   Erickson's application of his research with violin players. But Gladwell, as best I can tell,
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:36.000]   arbitrarily selected 10,000 hours because that was a number that was discussed in the research
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.960]   showing that the elite performers had accumulated 10,000 hours by a certain age, but it's a totally
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:46.960]   arbitrary number. To be a world-class performer in some fields may require many more than 10,000
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.880]   hours, and in other fields, it may require much less, just depends on the field. So there's
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.880]   nothing magical about 10,000 hours being the key that separates an expert from a non-expert.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.120]   But what is right and useful about 10,000 hours is that you're going to need hours of practice.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.880]   And this is the same thing that I say in the few areas that I am an expert in,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.680]   is it's just a matter of the time you put into it. So when I teach someone about language learning,
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.320]   I focus on the time. If you spend the time with the language, you're going to do it.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.920]   And that's the key factor. Now, there's good technique and bad technique. There's things
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.480]   that can get you better, faster results and less fast results. And so that's an expression
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.840]   of deliberate practice in the world of language. But at its core, the key thing is you're going
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.080]   to get better at it when you are engaging in it for a significant amount of time.
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:37.520]   So we should trumpet this from the rooftops that you can be a leader in a field if you have enough
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.320]   time and you put in enough practice. The cool thing also, I've adapted this to a couple of
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.600]   other applications. Just this weekend, I was talking with a friend and I was talking about,
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.400]   we've got the 10,000 hour rule, which is what you might need to be a world-class performer. Sure,
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:56.240]   maybe so. That's a lot of hours that you need to put into an area. But you can create other
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.040]   versions of this rule. I heard of somebody talked about, and I found out not many people were
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.360]   writing on it, but I found it enormously motivating, the concept of a 100-hour rule
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.800]   that you could probably be in, say, the top 5% of a field if you just did 100 hours a year.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:17.040]   100 hours a year comes out to two hours a week, so call it 20 minutes a day. If you do something
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.400]   for 15 or 20 minutes a day at 100 hours a year, you're never going to be the top person in a
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.720]   field, but you'll probably be in the top 5%. You can at least develop a skill that's going to
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.960]   dramatically change your life. And so even if you're not going to become an expert at everything,
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:36.000]   learning some things and becoming expert at more things just through applications a small amount
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.760]   of time is a big deal. And then you could even craft other rules from this. I was describing
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.920]   the benefits of when I learned to salsa dance. And I had less than 20 hours of instruction in
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.400]   salsa dancing, and it transformed everything in my life. I took one class in college that was
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.720]   Latin dance, and just 20 hours of instruction that I then went on to practice more was totally
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:06.000]   transformative in my life. I'll save those stories for another time. But the experience of that 20
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   hours impacted me enormously. And I think there's lots of things like that, that you don't actually
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.040]   need hundreds of hours. You don't need 100 hours a year. You just need a couple dozen hours of
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.800]   exposure to various things, and you'll gain something from it. So I'm firmly in the camp of
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.440]   the generalist being valuable, but the message we need to teach people is just to say that you
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:33.120]   can do it. So try, get started. I think where we can see this the most obviously has to do
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:38.960]   with academic subjects, and that was the context of Friday. I can't find any evidence that there's
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.240]   any innate difference in innate ability for people who are good at math and people who are not good
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.400]   at math, or innate ability for people who are good at writing and who are not good at writing.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.960]   I can't find it. If it exists, tell me. I've looked for it. I haven't done an exhaustive
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.560]   search, but if you know of it, find it. I can't find any evidence that any innate ability for
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.080]   academic subjects in school counts. On the contrary, I can find lots of evidence that
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:10.880]   fit all of the model of Erickson's book, Peak. It had to do with motivation, has to do with
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:16.720]   the time spent, has to do with interest and how that interest is cultivated that indicate it.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:24.240]   I don't see why every person, every student is not capable of being very good at mathematics,
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.800]   is not capable of being very good at writing, is not capable of being very good at history,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:34.000]   and not being capable of being very good at science. I don't see any reason why every student
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.840]   can't perform very well in all of these areas. I don't see any reason why you have to specialize
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:47.040]   in the early years. It seems self-evident to me that poor performance in any one of these areas
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:53.280]   has much more to do with teaching methodology, bad pedagogy, uninspiring teachers,
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:58.960]   inconsistent practice, the wrong kind of practice than it does with anything else.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:05.840]   So, what's the foundation of a good educational plan? I think reading is the foundation of a
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.720]   good educational plan. If you go back and listen to my series on how to invest in your children at
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.680]   an early age, I go through a lot of the arguments. Number one is exposure to verbal language.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.560]   Children should be surrounded by lots and lots of language. In so doing, they will gain lots of
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.600]   words that they will know, and they will gain lots of general knowledge about the world.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.160]   Then, when they are readers, we want to help them to read very extensively. That comes from
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.880]   inspiring interest. So, when a child is highly motivated to read, he or she is going to read
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:44.800]   very widely. That reading widely is going to allow the child to have broad general exposure
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:51.680]   to the world, huge vocabulary, and to absorb the structures of written language, which are
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:57.920]   different than the structures of colloquial verbal language. That is likely to cause the child to
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.560]   naturally be skilled with writing. So, if we pull writing apart into its component parts,
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:11.760]   writing consists of two basic elements. The ability to use words to take abstract thought
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.640]   and convert it into concrete words, and secondarily, the skill of actually putting
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:22.080]   down sentences on paper with the physical act of writing, proper orthography, proper grammar,
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.200]   things like that. Well, that's very trainable if we pull it apart and train it. If a child has a
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:35.200]   broad bank of literary knowledge, then the child is likely to be a skilled writer. And creativity
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:41.120]   grows over time, and writing skill grows with practice. And so, every child should be a great
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.520]   writer through lots and lots of practice. What about other subjects? Well, math is the obvious
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:51.440]   example. To me, mathematics is obviously something that everyone is capable of with the right kind of
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.080]   practice. So, what is often missing in people who are bad at math? Well, first, they've often
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:02.560]   probably missed out on motivation. Nobody's come along and inspired them about mathematics. They
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:07.200]   may not have understood the subject in a way that is applicable, which is why I think we should do
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:13.760]   more narrative math and less worksheets and just kill and drill worksheets. But even if we're doing
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.800]   worksheets, we should do them consistently in modest doses, not to overwhelm the attention
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.960]   span of the child, and do them much more consistently. Math, the way that it's taught
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:27.680]   in the context of the school year with enormous breaks for summer, is just a catastrophe,
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:31.920]   because these are skills that need to be practiced every day. And so, if we take this skill and we
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.680]   do math six days a week, 20 minutes a day, 30 minutes a day, an hour a day, and growing over
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:43.920]   time, how can a child not be good at mathematics? And especially if we get individualized instruction
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.080]   where we're always teaching to exactly the thing that the child is needing to learn,
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:55.120]   and we're not going too fast. And so, the child is not getting lost with a class that can grasp
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:59.920]   a concept faster than he can, but rather is just going at his own individual pace.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.320]   So, I don't see why any child shouldn't be very skilled with mathematics. It all builds
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.040]   systematically, and if you do the work day by day, year by year, then you're going to wind
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:15.520]   up with the necessary skills and the fullness of time. What about history? Well, same thing,
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.240]   interest. Interest, narrative, spending time with the subject. Why are so many students bad
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:25.200]   at history? Well, because you sit down in ninth grade and you're handed a stupid, boring,
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:30.160]   sawdust textbook to read, and you have no context for everything. But if you've spent 10 years
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:36.080]   before that reading stories of the past, then you have all these different pegs to hang things on,
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.480]   so you can hang the facts and the dates onto people that you've lived with for years. You've
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.920]   read their stories, you've read the historical fiction, you've read their biographies,
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.400]   you've read the narratives that involve them. And so, these are living creatures,
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.960]   living people with whom you have a relationship. So, now, facts and figures and meaning and all
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.320]   of that can easily be absorbed in that context. Same thing with science.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.600]   Why are people bad at science? Well, again, it's just because you're handed a textbook out of the
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:07.200]   blue in 10th grade that's about biology and said, "Learn this." But it's all new vocabulary,
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:13.680]   and you have 100 and, call it 150 or 160 days to absorb all this vocabulary. You don't have any
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:20.000]   framework to hold it on. But in my model, if you've read great scientists, their biographies,
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:23.280]   and their stories of how they invented things, and you've spent all your time with all these
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:28.080]   wonderful living narratives that have engaged you with the context, and you've spent your time
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.520]   studying through and you're doing it over the course of years rather than trying to do it all
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.440]   in one year, then it should be pretty doable for you to do really well on your A-levels or get a
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:42.720]   five on your AP biology exam because you've sat with the information for so long. And it's not
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.240]   just try to stuff down your head. So, there's a whole world of learning science that I'm not even
[01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:55.440]   talking about here. But at its core, I think we can expect any child to learn effectively and to
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.640]   be skilled in all of these areas. This should transform how we teach children. This should
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:08.480]   transform every aspect of what we do. To apply generalization, I think children should have a
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:14.160]   general education. The model should be general and then allow them to self-select into the areas that
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.440]   are the most interest. If we know that certain skills are actually going to have a physical
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:25.680]   impact on the body and the brain, we should stress those skills. And from an academic perspective,
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:30.160]   children should do math, not because they're going to use it, but because it makes them smarter.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.800]   It grows gray matter in their brain. When I read Peek, I found all the math bits. I read it to my
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.800]   children. This is why we do math, guys, because it grows your brain. It literally adds gray matter
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:43.200]   to your brain. So, you do math so that you're smarter. And when you're smarter, because you've
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:48.160]   grown the gray matter in your brain, you're more capable of doing better math. So, 10 years from
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.000]   now, everyone's going to say, "Well, math just comes easily to you." Yeah, it comes easily to
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.360]   me because it didn't come easily to me in the beginning, but I built gray matter in my brain
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:01.120]   that made it come more easily to me. So, we know that math ability impacts IQ. We know that doing
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.280]   math makes you smarter. It grows your brain. So, therefore, we should do math consistently
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:11.120]   and over time. I call math, basically, mathematics, the barbell for the brain.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.640]   And by a little speech to my children, I read a book one time on how to teach math to young
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:20.800]   people, and the author made a big point. Don't tell people that they're going to use math. So,
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.000]   don't tell your ninth grader, "Yeah, you definitely need this geometry because you're
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.320]   going to use it." That's a lie. You know he's not going to use it. Why do you do math? Because
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:34.480]   it makes you smarter, and in the same way that a barbell is infinitely adjustable for any body.
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:40.400]   You can put a barbell on a 99-year-old old woman's life on her back and teach her how to squat it,
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.240]   and you can find a barbell exercise that's appropriate for her, and it will help her to
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.440]   grow muscle and get stronger. You can put a barbell and load it up for a 30-year-old powerlifter at
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:56.720]   the peak of his career with 800 pounds on it, and the barbell is the tool that allows you to add the
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.760]   necessary appropriate stress with the desirable difficulty to the human body. That's what's so
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:07.200]   powerful about a barbell. Well, mathematics, I see, is the same thing. It is an appropriate tool
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.360]   that you can work through with a five-year-old that is going to allow the five-year-old to
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:19.600]   learn at an appropriate level, and to the 55-year-old double PhD in theoretical mathematics,
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.800]   he's still sitting there doing math, thinking, and getting his brain smarter. Math is infinitely
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:31.360]   scalable. So it should probably be the core academic skill that is applied to everyone
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:35.680]   because it's infinitely scalable up and down. And in the same way that with a barbell,
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:41.120]   we can add an ounce to the bar and get you just a little bit stronger, or we can add 10 pounds
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.720]   to the bar, the student can go through math very slowly or very quickly, depending on current
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:51.200]   ability and what the math is that we're doing right now. So the reason we do math is to make
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:57.920]   you smarter. Why do we do music? Well, music makes you smarter. It grows your brain. It allows you to
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:03.600]   access the aesthetics of the world in a different way. So we should all study music, learn music.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:08.000]   Music is one of those other things that we know it increases IQ. So we should practice and learn
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.960]   music. Incidentally, when I talked about this a long time ago, I mentioned that I was going to
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:19.280]   be testing a bunch of apps. I am profoundly persuaded now of the value of modern apps
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:24.560]   for teaching music as a great thing. SimplyPiano is the one that I've tested the most. It's
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:30.880]   fantastic. I think it's best used with a teacher, but it's fantastic. I could go on and on. It's a
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.440]   good example of deliberate practice. So consider these. I'll skip that for now. But music is
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.640]   something that all students should learn because it is helping their ability. It's making them
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.440]   smarter. Other artistic expressions, same thing. Drawing, painting, these are things that are
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:50.080]   important. They're aesthetic disciplines that help you to see the world differently, and they
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:56.640]   will change how your brain works in a positive way, give you a more diverse array of abilities.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:02.480]   Language, same thing. Language makes you smarter. I'm not aware of any evidence that reading
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.040]   increases IQ, but I think reading absolutely makes you smarter in the common sense of it.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:11.120]   It's got to increase IQ, but I just don't know. I haven't read anything of that being the case.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:15.120]   But reading is how you learn about the world. It makes you smart. It makes you understand how the
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.720]   world works, which is the definition of smartness, not just being able to do well on an IQ test.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.680]   And so being widely read is an important component, and that should be in your native language.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.520]   But then in addition to being widely read, you should be working your way
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.240]   up systematically. All students should be working their way up the scale of complexity
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:40.080]   and difficulty. If you are actually a reader who reads a lot and doesn't just read fluff for the
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.400]   brain, then when you get to things like an SAT exam, it's a joke. You never have to study for
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:49.600]   that stuff. It's just a joke because you're reading complex novels, complex material,
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.480]   philosophy that has difficult ideas, historical analysis that has difficult vocabulary,
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:00.800]   very complex writing styles. That's what you should be reading, growing up to it little by
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:05.520]   little. We also know that foreign languages make your brain bigger, grow your gray matter in your
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:11.040]   brain. So you should be doing this in multiple languages and systematically just working your
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:17.200]   way up the structure because it's making you smarter. Now, take this student who's just being
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:26.960]   gently led up this structure through a dozen or 15 years of education and now bring it to a specialty.
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:31.600]   And I think this is the right model where you're going to have all of that generalist background
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:37.280]   that then gets applied to an area of special interest where you really go deep, but yet you
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.040]   didn't go too deep too early. That's the takeaway. That's what we should be doing.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.720]   The other thing I didn't talk about, though, was physical ability and athletic ability.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:51.120]   I believe the same basic concept applies. When I was younger, I had this stupid idea that somehow
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.160]   some people are just born athletic and other people aren't. It seems fairly obvious to me
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.000]   that some people are naturally more athletic than others are. I see this in family members. I see
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.840]   this in myself with comparison. I have a brother who is just always naturally athletic. I was always
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.000]   naturally clumsy and uncoordinated. But then what happens is we tend to funnel people
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.600]   into different pathways based upon this basic natural ability.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.160]   And a friend of mine who is a physical trainer, he was explaining, he was like, "Children,
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:26.640]   why don't some children move?" Well, they don't move because it doesn't feel good to move.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.720]   Why doesn't it feel good to move? Because they don't know how to move oftentimes. And so moving
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.120]   to them doesn't feel good, so they don't want to do it. Well, they don't do it,
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.840]   and then it feels worse and worse for them. Whereas for the children who know how to move,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.400]   then they know how to move, so it feels good for them to move, so they move more.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.600]   And as they move more, they get better at moving, their skills of knowing how to move increase with
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.560]   practice, and they just naturally move more and they become athletic. And so this particular
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.440]   trainer friend of mine, when we talked about how to train children with athletics, a big focus of
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:04.880]   his was teaching movement skills, teaching people how to move. Because if you can teach a child that
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:09.760]   doesn't move a lot how to move in a way that doesn't generate pain, but instead generates
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.800]   pleasure, then he's more likely to move more. In hindsight, I look at them and say, "Duh,
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:20.240]   obviously, that should be the key." But what that means is that we need good physical training for
[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:25.680]   young people, consistent environments where they're training constantly. And a lot of that
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:30.160]   should be done in the context of play, but there should be focused training for children so that
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.360]   their play can be better. So this is the area I know the least about from my own personal ignorance,
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:41.920]   but I'm trying to engage in it and try to build it. And a lot of this, I think, should be generalized
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:47.760]   movement patterns, not sport-specific movement, but generalized movement patterns and strength
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:53.040]   building. As best I can tell, the dominant theory of physical education in the United States today
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:59.520]   seems to be that if you play sports or play, then you'll learn how to move. And that's not the only
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:04.160]   way to approach it. There's a fascinating pathway you can go down. If you look at the infamous
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:09.040]   example of La Sierra High in California in the 1960s, where you had this high school implemented
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:15.760]   this school-wide athletic training program, PE program, for all of its students, where they
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:24.320]   focused on teaching strength rather than teaching sport. They created some of the most high-performing
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:32.560]   sports teams, and they created a student body of young men and young women that was beautiful,
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:38.240]   flat-out beautiful. I'm using that word very intentionally. If you go back and you look at
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:45.440]   the videos and you see just an entire student population of beautifully muscled, strong young
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:50.000]   men, beautifully coordinated, strong young women, you see the men more than the women in the old
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:57.520]   videos. That's what we want. And unfortunately, with the death of President Kennedy, all of that
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:02.400]   basically disappeared in the American system, and it's all disappeared in the wake of sport.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:08.400]   And we've got a bunch of fat slobs that are ugly high school students instead of beautiful in what
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.040]   should be the most beautiful part of their life. There's people working at it, and we should be
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.880]   supporting them. But at the very least, we owe it to ourselves and to our children to teach them
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:22.080]   movement patterns, teach them strength, so that their later specialization with sport will come
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.640]   into play. And we've got great science in that world. It's just not spreading across to the
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.760]   general population. So I believe that we can and should be advancing ourselves and as a culture
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:41.040]   and as a civilization. We could fix all of these problems. We just lack the will to do it.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.600]   We don't care to do it. We haven't persuaded our neighbors that they should care. And we have
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:53.920]   enormously dysfunctional systems. So what I've done is I've just withdrawn from all of that,
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:59.840]   from the system, and I've said, "I can do it better, and let me prove it." And that's what I'm
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:07.280]   myself working on. I don't mean to sound arrogant or kind of bragging, but it's important sometimes
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.080]   to say things in advance before you do them. In the way that what Laszlo Polgar, if he had just
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:23.280]   had three daughters who were really skilled with chess, and he didn't set out in advance and say,
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:30.560]   "This is what I'm going to do," his story would not be nearly as impactful. So I'm telling you
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:34.880]   the same in advance while I'm in it. But I don't believe there's any limit on human performance.
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:42.560]   I believe that every person is capable of getting better, and that most people are capable of
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:47.120]   extreme high performance if they have the right environment, the right inputs, and the right
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.320]   coaches teaching them. And so I'm doing my best to do that in my homeschool, to do it on an
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.600]   academic level, to do it on a physical level, to do it on an ideally social grace level. I think
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.400]   that's the hardest, but I'm working at it. That's where I've had the most failures. But I believe
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:10.080]   we should create, we should be able to create superhumans in terms of having the qualities and
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:16.640]   characteristics that we desire. If elite schools for years have been able to do this, I have a
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.280]   great interest in this. I've gone and studied as best I could find the curricula of the world's
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:25.280]   elite boarding schools and things like that. There's no question that these schools have
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.880]   succeeded in producing very high performing students. So we need to understand that.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.680]   And I wish I could go and snap my fingers and change the whole government school system in
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.920]   the US, but I can't do it. But what I can do is I can experiment in my own house,
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:45.200]   and I want to encourage you to experiment with your children and find the best science that you
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:51.520]   can, use your intuition to filter that science to the specifics of your children, teach them,
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.000]   and then let's compare notes on what's working, what's not working. Let's figure out how we can
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:01.920]   do that so that our great-grandchildren can do so much better. I see myself as the patriarch
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:08.560]   of a dynasty. I see you as the patriarch of a dynasty, the matriarch of a dynasty. I see you
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:13.920]   as having a very important role to play in that. And what you're doing today in your household,
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.120]   based upon your philosophy of learning and of genius performance and knowledge and all of that,
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.760]   the family culture that you're building will impact your great-great-grandchildren
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:29.600]   as it should. So, you should be thinking about that. You should be eating healthy today,
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:35.280]   not just for yourself, but you should be eating healthy today so that you can set the example in
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.120]   front of your children, so that they'll be healthy, so that the epigenetic long-term outcome
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.600]   of your great-great-grandchildren is superior. We need that kind of superiority in the human race.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.040]   And don't ever let the fact that other people may not be able to do what you do
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:57:00.960]   to cause you to pull back. The world is served in no way by your playing small,
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:08.240]   by your shrinking back. The world is served by your playing hard and well so that you become
[01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:13.360]   strong and so that your family becomes strong so that you can reach out a hand to those nearby who
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:21.760]   are weak and lift them up. I shouldn't go down this path. What angers me so much about
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:33.440]   our current philosophical argumentation is that it seems like a substantial number of our
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:40.160]   neighbors want to basically destroy high performance due to jealousy. They want to
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:44.960]   tear down the wealthy due to jealousy. They want to tear down the smart and the beautiful because
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.800]   not everybody can be smart and beautiful, and we need equity across population. This is the most
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:58:01.360]   destructive thing possible. Jealousy of another person is sin. It is absolute sin, and it is
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:10.480]   one of the most damaging long-term things. Being covetous of what someone else has is totally
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:14.560]   destructive, and it's totally sinful, and it destroys your society. I've looked for this
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:20.240]   anecdote years ago. I read an anecdote. I thought it came from The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman,
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:25.680]   but I went and searched the book one time and I couldn't find it. But the author of the book was
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:31.840]   giving an example, and he was giving the example of the difference between the United States,
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:37.440]   the culture of the United States of America, and the culture of the Middle East. And he was
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:42.560]   showing how children in the Middle East, well, children in the United States look up to the man
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:50.880]   who has a house on the hill, and they're taught, "Hey, Johnny, someday you, if you work hard enough,
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:56.960]   you yourself can have a house on the hill like that man has." Whereas the children in the Middle
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:02.880]   East are taught, "Muhammad, someday, if you work hard enough, you can blow up that house on the
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:09.040]   hill." And there's just such an obvious example of that metaphor, as obviously offensive as it
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.440]   is to so many people. It's such an obvious truth that if you teach your children that the goal is
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:18.800]   to go out and blow up and destroy the houses on the hill, you're going to be left with a totally
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:24.080]   raised neighborhood that's nothing but destruction and poverty and misery. But if you teach your
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:29.040]   children to build houses on a hill, and that they too, if they work hard enough, can build a house
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:33.680]   on the hill, you're going to have a neighborhood that is full of beautiful houses on a hill.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:39.680]   What do you want? Pick it. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:44.320]   So, with your children, don't teach them to hold back. Teach them to be as absolutely
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:51.520]   high-performing as they're capable of being. And whenever they run up against a genetic potential
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:56.080]   or an intelligence potential, just kind of ignore it and say, "That's all right. I can keep studying."
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:02.160]   I myself feel this all the time. I feel stupid. I know that I'm smarter than a lot of other people.
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:06.640]   I'm not saying this in a self-deprecating way. Sometimes I listen to stuff, I listen to people,
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:14.800]   and I just feel dumb. And I say, "How am I ever…? What do I know? I feel utterly stupid."
[02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:21.920]   But I remind myself with the philosophy that that's okay. I'm not responsible for the intelligence
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:26.240]   that God gave that man over there, I'm just responsible for my own. And if I'll just keep
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:31.200]   on working at it, I can probably learn in 10 years from now what that guy's saying today that I don't
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.320]   get, I'll probably get it if I keep working at it. And that's the power of philosophy.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:41.520]   You should cultivate this philosophy in yourself and in your children, because regardless of what
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:47.200]   the science says or what the science doesn't say, it's a useful, functional philosophy that will
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:53.440]   put you in a position of having better outcomes. And then remember, "To whom much is given,
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:01:00.640]   much is required." If you are given intelligence, you're not given that so you can go out in the
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.200]   world and puff up your chest and say, "Well, I'm just so much smarter than you, and here's
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:10.640]   my MENSA membership." You're given that so that you can serve your fellow man. You have to use
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:15.280]   your gifts and your talents and your abilities and your intelligence and your athleticism and
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:22.080]   your strength to help others who are weak. If you were given much, if you are privileged,
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:27.920]   you are going to be held accountable to that. I am enormously privileged in my life,
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:34.720]   and I'm going to be held accountable for that based upon how I use my skills and my gifts to
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:43.200]   serve others. The same for you. If you grew up wealthy, you have an obligation to steward that
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:50.480]   wealth for the benefit of the poor. If you grew up in a loving household with two parents who
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:58.400]   loved you and made an amazing life for you, you have an obligation to use that and spread it in
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:03.760]   the world. You have an obligation to open your mouth and talk about it to help others to have
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:10.240]   the same results. If you're intelligent, you have an obligation to use your intelligence for the
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:17.840]   good of mankind. Your ambition should be to be a Nobel Prize winner so that the whole world can
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.400]   benefit from the work of your hands and the work of your mind. I hope that's a good place to leave
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:29.920]   this subject. I would encourage everyone to read these books. I've just touched on the foundation.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:34.800]   I really like the order that I read them in. I like reading "Peak Secrets from the New Science
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:41.840]   of Expertise" by Anders Ericsson first, followed by "Talent is Overrated" by Jeff Colvin. I think
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:46.800]   those two could be swapped out either way. They're compatible. And if you wanted to skip them,
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.880]   skip one of them. They're very good. They're just different. But my favorite of the three was "Peak,"
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.760]   then "Talent is Overrated," and then "Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" by
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:01.920]   David Epstein. All of them available in audio. All of them are available pretty cheap on Kindle and
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.960]   paperback. They're super cheap, and they're well worth your time. And it's important that you have
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:10.880]   a good scientific foundation for these beliefs. And I hope that I've inspired you to check it out.
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:16.240]   Hope I've inspired you to take these things and do them. I just want to close by saying,
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:24.800]   the world needs you and your genius. The world needs your children and their genius.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:32.320]   We're all in this together. Your work is important. So get at it.
