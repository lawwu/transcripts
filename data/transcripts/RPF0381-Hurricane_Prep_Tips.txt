[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.680]   building a plan for financial freedom in ten years or less.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.680]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.080]   Today is Tuesday, October 4, 2016, early in the morning on Tuesday.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.000]   And as things stand presently, there is another hurricane, a relatively large one, Category
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.920]   4, headed in the direction of the United States.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.360]   Presently, this hurricane, Hurricane Matthew, is inundating Haiti and Cuba with rain and
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.200]   certainly very high winds.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.280]   Men and women down there are facing a very difficult circumstance.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.840]   But the cone of uncertainty certainly has much of the eastern seaboard of the United
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.480]   States in its sights, including where I live here in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   We'll see, time will tell whether it moves towards us or not, but at this point, it's
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   certainly important to go ahead and take some preparations.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Today I have plans to share with you some simple, cheap, and very practical steps that
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.400]   you can take for hurricane preparations.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.160]   I was born and raised in Florida, so hurricanes are nothing new.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.040]   My parents spent a number of years of their life in the Philippines long before I was
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.160]   born, back in the '70s.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.280]   And so they went through various typhoons there, so I've grown up in a family that's
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.440]   relatively comfortable with dealing with tropical storms.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.480]   For those of you who are not in hurricane country, I know hurricanes can often seem
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.720]   a little bit overwhelming and seem like, "How could you handle them?"
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.240]   In my opinion, they're one of the best types of natural risks to face just because of the
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880]   advance warning.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000]   Earthquakes don't generally give as much advance warning as hurricanes do.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.920]   Tornadoes don't generally give as much advance warning as hurricanes do.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.080]   And hurricanes are relatively simple to prepare for.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.240]   They are usually not that big of a deal in the sense of when compared to other disasters
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.980]   that can be more acute.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.520]   The reason hurricanes are a big deal is because of their large size, that when they come through
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.080]   your state, your city, your county, they can devastate a massive region.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.360]   And so they're generally a major hassle to deal with.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240]   But today I'm going to walk through some hurricane preparations for you.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.840]   And these are things that I believe are simple and practical.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.760]   This show is not intended to be an exhaustive resource for you, but just some things that
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.160]   I have found to be useful and practical in the past.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.780]   As we sit at the moment here on, again, Tuesday, October 4, we don't know what the actual course
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.000]   of this hurricane will be.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And the tendency that we generally seem to have as humans is to wait until the last minute
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.320]   to prepare.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.600]   Unfortunately, that's a bad move because that's when it's the hardest to prepare.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.920]   You see people rushing out right when the storm's about to hit and trying to put gas
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.260]   in their car and trying to get milk and eggs and bread from the grocery store and things
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.920]   get wiped out.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920]   You want to avoid that.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.440]   And a good secret of life is a good point to be well prepared in life is to move in
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.320]   a counter cyclical way.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.660]   So if you've prepared for hurricanes when it wasn't hurricane season, the stores were
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.920]   filled and there's plenty of options around and you can stop shop around and get the best
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.120]   deals and you can lay the things by that you need to be ready for a hurricane.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360]   If you wait to the last minute, you're in competition with everybody else.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.560]   Prices change.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.380]   Supplies run low and they can face significant problems.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.400]   So the best time to prepare is always before the fact.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.240]   Hopefully, I'll be able to get this show out to you in about an hour and this will be early
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.400]   enough that you can still take a few simple precautions.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   The other aspect of preparation is you want to make sure that the things that you do are
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.560]   going to serve you even if a storm doesn't come.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   If you rush out and buy 10 loaves of bread and then the storm doesn't come and all your
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   bread goes stale and moldy, then you'll be a little bit frustrated with yourself.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.980]   By the way, buying bread in advance of a hurricane is not necessarily a good idea.
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.600]   And if you do buy bread and it's starting to go stale and moldy, put it in the freezer.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.960]   That's the way you keep bread to last longer.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.720]   But you want to make sure the things that you do are reasonable, rational and not a
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.860]   knee-jerk reaction to fear.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.300]   So let's talk about hurricanes and these simple preparation items will be specific to hurricanes
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.880]   but I think will be very practical to you no matter what type of natural disaster that
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.160]   you face.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.440]   With regard to hurricanes, there are two problems of the hurricane and this is the same again
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.960]   with most natural disasters.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.200]   There's the acute problem, the time during the actual storm, which is a relatively short
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.540]   period of time.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.160]   And then there are the after effects of the storm.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.540]   The acute problem is high winds, a significant amount of rain, the risk of flying projectiles
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.840]   coming through your window, etc. and invading your home and just simply the physical danger
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.980]   of that.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.160]   If you are living in a strong modern structure, generally you're not going to have much of
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.240]   a problem.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.280]   If you're not in a strong modern structure, your best course of action is to leave.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.440]   It's that simple.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.300]   Hurricanes devastate people who live in mobile homes or who live in old poorly built houses.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.080]   Generally not that big of a problem, people who live in newer modern well-built structures.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   If you live in a mobile home or if you live in a similar physically weak structure, you
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.560]   need to leave.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.860]   And it's the very best most important thing that you can do.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.800]   Do not even consider trying to wait it out.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.220]   Leave.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.020]   And this is definitely one stroke in favor of living in newer modern residences.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.080]   As much as I wish building codes didn't exist from a political personal freedom perspective,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.680]   it is certainly easy to appreciate them when you live in a structure where a big storm
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   is coming.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.360]   That's the major design of them.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   And that's the time where you can appreciate them the most.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.400]   During the acute problem of a storm, storms are generally fairly short-lived.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.360]   We're talking, depending on the speed of the storm, 10 to 20 hours.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.880]   And basically it's usually just a lot of rain, a lot of wind.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.160]   It's rather fun and kind of exciting if it's your first time.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.840]   It's a little old after a while, but basically the wind pounds your house and you get tons
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.480]   of rain and watch stuff fly through the air.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   It's interesting.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.880]   After you've done it once, you don't really want to do it again.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.040]   But the after effects are the harder time.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.000]   And these things are usually more of a nuisance than they are acute problems.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.100]   If a tree branch comes through your window and the flying glass breaks into your house
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.920]   and you wind up with your kids walking on it and cutting themselves, that's an acute
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   problem.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   But the big problem is just simply the power outages and dealing with it.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.880]   Power outage is the biggest hassle that most people face.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.560]   And so most of our preparations for something like a hurricane are simply preparing for
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.880]   being without power from anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.200]   Now, the amount of time that you're without power will largely depend on where you live
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.280]   in relation to the power grid.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.640]   After a hurricane or a similar event, the power crews come in.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.640]   Here in South Florida, they have a well-oiled machine.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.040]   Our local power utility is Florida Power and Light.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.760]   And they have this stuff down to an incredible science.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.780]   They have disaster response teams.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.640]   They have all the stuff mapped out.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.680]   They recruit power crews from all over the Southeast.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.080]   Same thing when there are problems up in Carolinas, the FPL crews go up there and they come in
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.560]   and they start with the biggest number of people first.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.200]   So if you live on a main line or if you live in an area where there are lots of people,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.080]   chances are your power can come back pretty quickly.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   If you live in a more remote area or where you're not on a main line, there's just a
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.780]   few hundred people on your line, chances are you're going to be waiting until the end.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.080]   By now, you should probably know that.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.680]   If you've lived there a while, you should know that.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.120]   If not, you may or may not be able to figure it out.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.340]   But most of the preparations that we need to do for hurricanes is simply to prepare
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.920]   to be physically safe during the acute event during the storm and to prepare to do without
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.480]   power and utilities after the storm for a period of time.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.240]   So let's walk through some very simple preparations that you can make.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.960]   The first most important need that you need to attend to is communication.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.840]   Your ability to communicate with others and your ability to have information to know what's
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.320]   the best thing to do.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.880]   Information and communication should be your highest priority.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.280]   And you should start with your cell phone.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.520]   Cell phone is your most important communication asset.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.040]   Now I'm a long time amateur radio operator.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.600]   I got my license when I was – I'm sorry, I don't remember exactly but I think I was
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.080]   10, 11, 12 years old, something like that.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.880]   And I spent years participating in the local emergency communication organizations.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.320]   They call it the – there's an organization they call Amateur Radio Emergency Services,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.400]   ARIES, and then there's another one called RACES.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   But these are the organizations that do disaster preparedness.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.760]   When I was younger, I would deploy to the Red Cross shelters during the hurricanes and
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.820]   serve as a communications operator where you go and set up your communications.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.680]   In the amateur radio space, there's a long time idea that amateur radio – when everything
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.800]   else fails, amateur radio works.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.040]   And that is true to some extent.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.840]   But it used to be much more true than it is now.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.320]   It used to be that in the past, the phone lines would go down and basically people couldn't
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   communicate for days and days and days.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.560]   But cellular technology has completely changed all of that.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.200]   Now in the early days of cellular technology, when a hurricane or a storm would come through,
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.000]   that would mean that the network would be down for a long time, many days if not weeks.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   And so in those cases, radio was even more important than it is now.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.880]   Today, however, the mobile phone companies have really done an amazing job of preparing
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.060]   for acute events like storms.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.760]   What they actually do is they have these units they call – I think they call them CALS,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.480]   cellular on wheels, acronym is CALS, where they bring in these mobile cellular trucks
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:41.080]   which are a mobile cell station all in self-contained with a power source, antenna, radio abilities.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.600]   And they bring these things into a disaster area and they'll reignite the network very,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.880]   very quickly.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.360]   And so if you look at past storms, the biggest one was Hurricane Sandy, and you compare the
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:58.120]   response time of the mobile networks and how quickly they came back online, it is dramatically
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.720]   better than it was in the past.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.920]   That's not to say that the cell phone system can't go down.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.560]   And that's not to say that there's no place for things like radio.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.640]   But for most people, the idea of getting into radio is going to be far bigger – far much
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.120]   – too big of a hassle for you to really want to really engage in.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.360]   And your cell phone is your best tool.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.120]   It may not work during the acute event and it may not work during the first little bit
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.480]   of time after the event, but it will work better than it's ever done in the past.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.480]   And the mobile phone companies do a great job of bringing the networks back quickly.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:37.120]   Incidentally, if you're interested why radio is still important versus a cell phone, radio
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:44.400]   is the way that you can communicate with other people without a centralized network that's
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.560]   being maintained by somebody else.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:52.760]   So cell phones and internet connectivity through the cell phone is a far superior technology
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.400]   to radio signal during a time when the grid is up, to use a generalized term.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.560]   You can communicate and put a picture on Twitter and somebody on the other side of the world
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.120]   can see that instantly.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.320]   That is powerful.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.240]   And cell phones are – and mobile technology, because of the connection to the network,
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.520]   is just – the ability to communicate is unparalleled.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.920]   It's unparalleled by anything in the radio world.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.280]   However, the disadvantages of things like a cell phone network is that you have to go
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.460]   through a gatekeeper.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.680]   You have to go through a centralized infrastructure and that infrastructure can either fail or
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.900]   it can be controlled.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.000]   So if you're depending on Twitter to organize your political resistance campaign in a closed-off
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.600]   totalitarian state, the state has the ability to shut off Twitter to some extent.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.000]   Now, you can work around that.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.140]   You can tunnel in with a – hide your IP and mask your IP and come in through a virtual
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.760]   private network into the gateway in the country and you can work around it.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.920]   There's – I mean VPNs in China are tremendous and people all over the world in the past
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.160]   when Netflix wasn't allowed in Europe, people would tunnel in with a VPN from the United
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.960]   States and there are ways around things.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.160]   But you're still dependent upon an internal infrastructure.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.720]   But the way that radio technology works is you can work from point to point.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.400]   So if I set up a long-range – it's called a high-frequency antenna with an amateur – with
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.720]   a ham radio, I can set up a radio in my backyard with string of wire across my yard and I can
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.960]   reach out to somebody and talk to somebody 8,000 miles away or 12,000 miles away if the
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.680]   signal propagation is effective and I can do it on a few watts of power where literally
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   you can speak from one side of the United States to another or around the world on just
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.360]   a couple of watts of power if you use the right technology or you can do it with hundreds
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.000]   or thousands of watts of power.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.400]   And because you can communicate person to person, there's no need for any centralized
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   infrastructure.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.960]   One of the great things about radio is it's possible to do many of the digital things
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.320]   that other people can do over a radio signal.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.160]   You can send email over a radio signal.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   You can communicate with digital modes of communication.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.520]   You can do texting.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.680]   And there is better and better integration all the time between the mobile device and
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.840]   the radio signal.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.360]   So radio does still have its place.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.240]   But for the sake of the vast majority of you, which I probably lost going through all that,
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.480]   don't worry about it.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.240]   Just dig into – just use your cell phone.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.240]   And it will work well very quickly after the storm if it goes down at all.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   The key to your cell phone is you got to keep it charged.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.280]   And if you want indications of how important this is, watch the news.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.640]   Either watch the news after this Hurricane Matthew event or consider back to your past
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.240]   news exposure from Hurricane Sandy or other large storms.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.320]   And what you see is that the number one thing that people want access to is a strip where
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.560]   they can plug in their cell phone charger.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   Walk through an airport.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   What do you see?
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.800]   People are plugging in their cell phones.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.960]   The ability to plug in and charge a cell phone is one of the primary things that you should
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.040]   plan for.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.140]   But the best way to do this is not to walk around aimlessly around your neighborhood
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.400]   looking for somebody who has a generator and carrying your little dinky little three-foot
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.920]   cell phone extension cord with you to plug it in.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.840]   The best way to do that is to maintain a battery backup system for yourself.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.520]   And the very best technology here is to own a few of the lithium battery backups, the
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.280]   larger battery packs.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.840]   Now, most of you have probably seen these as a freebie given away at something like
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.880]   an event where they give away this little square, little battery pack that goes in your
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.060]   pocket.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.920]   That stuff is fine, but I recommend that you buy one that's much bigger.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.400]   I will link in the show notes to a couple that I own.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:43.640]   I own one that's called a Comashi 15,000 milliamp external battery power pack portable charger
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.440]   with powerful dual USB.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.360]   I also own a RavPower 13,000 milliamp external battery pack.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.480]   And the reason I own these is because they were cheap.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.300]   The best deal is this Comashi one.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.540]   It's on sale right now on Amazon Prime for 17 bucks.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.640]   And it's a 15,000 milliamp external battery power bank.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.080]   So let me explain what this means.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.840]   If you look up your cell phone battery rating, you'll get a number that is rated in milliampere
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.840]   hours.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.880]   So my iPhone 6S Plus is rated for about 2,700, 2,800 milliamp hour batteries.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.440]   When you get those little freebies that you get at a show, those are great.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.000]   But if you check the label on them, you'll usually see that they're rated for about 2,200
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.240]   milliamps.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.200]   So they're not even a full charge as compared to your cell phone.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.840]   They're not even a full charge.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.280]   And they're not even a...
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.040]   They don't charge at a high voltage.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.280]   And so they're very slow to charge.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:46.320]   If you've ever plugged one in, they just grow very, very slowly.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.160]   If you buy a real battery backup power bank, like the one I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.280]   it's 17 bucks and it's rated 15,000 milliamp hours.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.880]   So that's in excess of about five full charges for your phone.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.160]   If your phone were at 0% and you wanted to bring it back to 100%, you can do that about
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.320]   five times completely from this charger.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.920]   And more importantly, well, also importantly, the charger has a very high output...
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:21.200]   Has a high output port where it'll do this charging very quickly.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.600]   And so if you do nothing else to prepare for a hurricane or if you do nothing else to prepare
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:32.440]   for life, you should own one at least, or preferably a few of these battery backup banks.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.160]   You can get them as high, if you look around online, you can get them as high as 20,000,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.320]   22,000 milliamp hours.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.960]   The balance that you're always...
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.120]   The thing that you're always trying to balance between these is how physically large the
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.200]   battery is and how much you actually need.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.460]   So I would recommend that if you don't own any battery power banks, you buy a diversity
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.640]   of sizes.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.040]   And that way you'll always have one available to you to take in whatever form it is.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.480]   So you might have a large 20,000 milliamp hour pack that you carry when you travel.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480]   That's what I do.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   I carry a few when I travel.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.800]   And that way, if you're sitting on an airplane or sitting in the airport and there's no power
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.360]   packs, you know that you basically have a very large battery pack.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.200]   You can use your phone the entire time.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.880]   If you watch movies, read books, listen to stuff, whatever you're doing while you're
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.660]   traveling, you can do that and you can still arrive with a phone that's at 100%.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.720]   When I'm traveling, for example, I was at FinCon 16 last week.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:31.640]   The entire time I was there, I kept my 15,000 milliamp hour battery pack in my back pocket.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.840]   And it's about the size of a second phone.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.160]   But it fits easily in the back pocket.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.880]   I stick my cord in there and then I charge up my phone a couple times throughout the
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   day.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.080]   Because when you're at an event like that, you're constantly using your phone.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.300]   You're constantly running it down.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.580]   And so it's very nice and very comforting to always know that it's in its high range
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.720]   of charge.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.080]   It can be really damaging psychologically, if nothing else, if it's actually to your
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.040]   business or if you need it.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.000]   There's an emergency and you need to access the mapping function.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.580]   You need to access the communication functions.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.580]   Something happens.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   You had a car accident.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.840]   Now you need to talk on it to get help there.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.640]   All of a sudden, you've been using the battery all day.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.040]   You didn't plan ahead for your battery backup and you're down to 10%.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.280]   That's not so fun.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.500]   And so carrying a battery backup system with you will be the best thing to do.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.320]   And this is the best thing to do for hurricane preparations as well.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.520]   So for you and for all the members of your household who have a phone, you should have
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.980]   a battery pack.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.620]   These are lithium ion batteries.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.300]   They work really, really well.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.960]   They maintain their charges really well.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.140]   They charge up right from a USB port.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.620]   And so you just need to make sure that you have these and you charge them up.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.460]   The best resource for this area of keeping your cell phone charged is Stephen Harris's
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.460]   website, which is cellphone1234.com.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.100]   I've mentioned him on the show in the past.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.220]   He's actually appeared on the show in the past all the way back in episode 85 where
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.140]   I interviewed him on how to really save money on utility bills.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.900]   Stephen is an energy expert.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.340]   That particular show was not well received because of the way that he conveys himself.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:12.340]   He comes across as somewhat arrogant and pompous, but he is a true expert in the area of energy.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:20.000]   And years ago, I found his preparation classes, his hurricane preparation classes, and I instantly
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.080]   recognized the excellence of his theory when it comes to this area of emergency preparations.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.440]   And I'll mention and link a couple of his websites that are incredibly valuable.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:37.300]   The best thing about his ideas, specifically with regard to emergency preparations, is
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.420]   they're much similar to the way that my ideas function in the world of finance, that
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.500]   everything is multifunctional and everything relates and everything is sensible.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.100]   So when he goes into emergency preparations, he doesn't approach it in a single way where
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   it only works in this one way.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.620]   Everything works together.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.900]   And I found that his engineering prowess is fantastic.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:05.740]   And so I've built many over the years, many of my own hurricane preparation plans around
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.000]   the ideas and topics that he has taught and that he discusses.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.940]   So I will link in the show notes and mention as I continue through my outline here more
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.220]   of his resources.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:21.060]   But he is without question one of the best resources on this area.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.860]   So your first need is communication.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.280]   That's the first thing you should prioritize.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.260]   That starts with keeping your cell phone charged.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:33.500]   If you do not have a highly functional car charger for your phone, which I'm sure the
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.700]   vast majority of you have, but get one.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.980]   Again, don't get one of the cheap ones, dollar ones from the gas station.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.260]   Get a good one that charges at a high voltage so it'll charge the phone quickly.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:49.900]   But most of you will use that as your primary source where if you need to charge your phone
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.240]   up, you put it in the car and you run it off the car battery.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.580]   More about that in a moment.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.300]   But keep your communications functional.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Charge your phone up.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:07.140]   Get some battery backups for your phone and make sure that you are prepared to keep your
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.500]   line of communication functional.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.100]   The next basic need that you have is cash, currency.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.940]   You need $20 bills, $10 bills, $5 bills, and dollar bills.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.300]   So if you don't have currency in your wallet or in your house, make sure that you go out
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.660]   and get some.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.020]   Because when something like a hurricane comes through, often the power disappears.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.500]   The items are often available if you've got currency, if you can hand over stacks of green
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.760]   money.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.140]   So make sure that you have stacks of green money.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:44.780]   Again, the items are usually available, but often because the power is down, the company's
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.860]   credit card processing system isn't working, the phone line isn't connecting, so they can't
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.900]   run your card.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:55.260]   But if you have stacks of currency, you can make the majority of your problems go away.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.500]   In addition to stacks of currency, have access to larger amounts of money.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.660]   So when you're preparing for a storm, pull out your debit cards, pull out your credit
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.700]   cards, make sure that you have all of them ready.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.340]   Make sure that you have access on different networks.
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.160]   If you have an American Express and a Visa or MasterCard, make sure that you have access
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.900]   to the cards with large credit lines, things like that.
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.220]   If you need to evacuate your family and you need to get on and you need to buy all of
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:24.140]   a sudden a bunch of plane tickets or a bunch of gas, or you need to buy hotel rooms and
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.500]   things like that, that's where you want to have easy access to money.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.020]   This is the role of debit cards, credit cards, and stacks of cash.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.940]   If you're like me, where you keep your checking account balances pretty lean in preparation
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.040]   for the storm, it might be good to go ahead and transfer over some money from your savings
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.540]   accounts into your checking accounts.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:48.140]   Make sure those accounts have a nice cushion in there during a storm or during the preparation
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.780]   for a storm or afterward.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:53.740]   You'll probably fall a little bit behind on your budgeting system.
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.320]   You might not be writing down every dollar, tracking it perfectly.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.620]   You might not do that.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.340]   So transfer over enough money into your checking account so that you have a comfortable cash
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.980]   cushion to where if you're spending money on things that you need to spend money on,
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.080]   you're not so concerned with it.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.460]   You need to always be prepared to leave and evacuate.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.820]   Anytime there's an acute crisis, you should consider seriously simply leaving.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:24.780]   Getting away and getting out is often the best course of action.
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:31.900]   If you're going to leave, you probably will want to leave early in order to beat the rush.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.100]   So if you're preparing for something like a hurricane, the time to pack is now.
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.020]   Or if you're not ready to pack, at least make sure that you've got lists written down.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.140]   What are the things that you're going to need to take with you?
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.940]   Simple examples, I have dogs.
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.900]   So if I'm going to travel, first I need to be prepared to travel to some place where
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.560]   my dogs will be able to be taken with me.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.620]   Hurricane shelter won't work because the hurricane shelters will not accept pets.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.660]   So I'll need to have a different plan that's going to work for my dogs.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.220]   And I need to do things like remember the dog food.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.500]   And if all of a sudden you decide late at four o'clock on Thursday afternoon, the storm
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.340]   scheduled to arrive on Thursday night, you're like, "No, I got to leave."
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.800]   You're rushing around your house and you forget things like dog food or you forget things
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.100]   like diapers or you forget things like toys and entertainment for the kids.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.820]   And now you've got cranky kids, hungry dogs, and no diapers to put the kids in.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.940]   So make sure that you have a plan in place to be prepared to leave and to evacuate.
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.220]   And this is the same for all of us, no matter any circumstance.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.020]   I should be able to walk up to your house, bang on the door and say, "Listen, you've
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.660]   got to get ready to leave.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:45.960]   There's a riot that's coming down the street or there's a gas leak at the plant next to
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.160]   us, or there's a chlorine leak," or whatever it is.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.860]   Usually, it's those types of things that need to...where you got to leave right away.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.300]   Get in your car and go.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.360]   And five minutes later, you should be able to have your family loaded up in the car.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.000]   You should be able to have the basics that you would need pre-prepared, pre-staged to
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.920]   be able to get you out, get you to a hotel, have the things that you need to be somewhat
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   comfortable for the next few days.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.080]   You should be prepared to do that and be able to leave in a few minutes under those circumstances.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.880]   Well, the way that you do that is you have a couple of bags packed.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.380]   You have a bag with some simple clothes, with some simple food, some granola bars.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.760]   You have some bags packed with a flashlight.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.020]   You have your bags packed with something like a battery charger, ready to go with an extra
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:37.960]   cable for your phone and for all your family's phones so that if you run out and your phone
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.920]   was at 20%, you have a battery.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.240]   You're not stuck without a phone charge.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.040]   Most important line of communication.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.600]   You might have a couple of cheap of those Motorola FRS radios, family radio service
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:54.080]   radios in there so that you can communicate if you and your spouse are carpooling and
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.240]   you're driving two cars where you can easily communicate between the two cars while you're
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.800]   evacuating.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   Things like that.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.400]   You should be prepared to leave and evacuate.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.200]   Now, generally, you're going to have more time than five minutes.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:09.280]   And so you should have these lists pre-made of what you would need if you had an hour
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   warning.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.520]   So for me, if I had an hour warning, there's going to be a lot more things that I'm going
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.880]   to load up and take with me than if I have five minutes warning.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.120]   So make the lists now.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.600]   If you've never done this, sit down, use the opportunity of an impending storm, and use
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.140]   it as a way to guide your thinking and say, "Okay, it's hurricane time.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.440]   What do I need to make sure that I have things covered?"
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.080]   Reference some of the lists and things that are easily available from the various emergency
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.200]   disaster response agencies, and that will also be helpful to you to make sure you don't forget
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   anything.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.960]   Also, reference your packing lists.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.720]   One suggestion for those of you who ever travel is make sure that you always have a master
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:55.560]   packing list which contains everything that you might ever need for traveling.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.600]   I did this 10 years ago, and if I ever need something that I don't have on a trip, I make
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.840]   sure it's on there.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.480]   But what it means is by having a master packing list, when I sit down for a trip, I just print
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.680]   out the master list.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.440]   I go through it, and I can pack in about 20 minutes, and I never forget anything because
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.240]   anything that I could ever possibly need is on that master list.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.040]   I use that master list to jog my memory, and I decide I'm going to a warm place where I
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.180]   don't need all this winter stuff, but if I were going to a winter place, then I would
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.480]   need this stuff.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.760]   Or I need to make sure that I have my chargers.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.120]   I need to make sure that I have my dental floss.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.660]   I need to make sure that I have a backup pair of glasses, et cetera.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:36.420]   So make sure that you have a master packing list, and use the next couple of trips that
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.840]   you go on to create that list, and then keep note of what you use, what you don't use,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.880]   and then you customize it for each trip.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.320]   But when you're doing something like this, you should reference your master packing list
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.060]   and figure out what you would need for a trip, and then figure out what you would need for
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.560]   something like an evacuation.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.920]   For an evacuation, I would add food and water to that list, dog food, dog leashes, dog collars,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   et cetera.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.160]   I generally have lots of food and water on my master packing list.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.000]   But the point of these lists is to get you ready to leave quickly and early.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.120]   If you think about when people evacuate for emergencies, again, the problem is when you
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.920]   get stuck with everyone else.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.040]   So think back to Texas, back to that disastrous hurricane, I forget the name of it, that hit
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.520]   before Katrina did.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.700]   And now people ended up sitting on a Texas highway for 12 to 18 hours, and they sat there
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.680]   and they ran out of gas sitting there on the highway because they were stuck in traffic.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.560]   If you think you're going to leave, go early and beat the rush.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.600]   Now to be prepared to go, you need to have a destination in mind.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.280]   So first, think about friends and family.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.440]   And hopefully you have a network of friends and family that would extend beyond your own
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.240]   city and your own county.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.200]   And just think about can you go and visit them.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.720]   If you're going to visit friends and family, you'll find number one, that's probably going
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.980]   to be cheaper because you won't be incurring large hotel bills.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.400]   And it'll also be more fun.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   So instead of sitting in a hotel room and stewing for three days, which might lead to
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.240]   you're not wanting to leave and evacuate quickly, you may just enjoy having a visit with a friend.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.680]   Thus, you can have a great little mini vacation by staying with friends and family and you
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.440]   won't have as big of a reason not to go because you're looking forward to actually being able
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.200]   to go and stay with friends and family.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.680]   So consider, and if you've never done this before, or if you're preparing for a hurricane,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.960]   sit down and look at a map and say, "Where are the friends and family located that I
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   know that are within a few hours of me?"
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.400]   For example, here where I live on West Palm Beach, I think about friends of mine that
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.200]   live on the West Coast of Florida.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.520]   That is generally, it's a couple hours away, about three hours away.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:45.800]   That's generally far enough away that I can be way away from any effects of a storm.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.500]   I have friends and family that live in Central Florida.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   It's a little bit closer.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.260]   Sometimes the things that would affect Eastern Florida or Southeastern Florida will also
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.340]   affect Central Florida, depending on something like the track of a storm.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.540]   Then I can go northward.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.300]   So I have friends and family up through the north that I could get to in a few hours.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.180]   So plot those things out on a map, whether that's physical or mental, and consider where
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.220]   you would go.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.820]   Then when you do something like look at a hurricane track, that will inform your decision
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.540]   of who to contact and which direction to go in.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.940]   You want to be away from the hurricane track and you want to be away from the potential
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.900]   changes of a hurricane track.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.060]   Something like Hurricane Matthew, which looks like it's going to be continuing, coming up
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.900]   the Eastern seaboard, I would not choose to go north to evacuate.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.860]   I would go west or southwest.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.420]   Generally wouldn't go south because if things change, you're stuck down in the worst part
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.660]   of Florida to be stuck in.
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:44.420]   But west gives me lots of options and I can still go south or north if I need to.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.940]   Friends and family, plot them out.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.940]   Hotels also work.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.780]   One thing that might be a good thing to do is if you think you're going to evacuate,
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.820]   sit down, look at a map, figure out where you're going to head to and make a couple
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.500]   of hotel reservations.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:02.020]   Try to find something that would be an enjoyable, inexpensive place to stay rather than last
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.100]   minute and you're stuck at some flea bag hotel on the side of the interstate.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.580]   Why not stay at a place with a pool where your kids will have something to do when you
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.740]   have that option?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.580]   So think it through, plan it through, and make a couple of ideas as far as what you
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   can do.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.220]   Next, fill up all the gas tanks on all your cars.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.260]   This is always the easiest way to store gas.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.860]   It is to have gas in your car.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.660]   A good habit to get into as far as simple preparations is to keep your gas tank mostly
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.660]   full.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.100]   When my gas tanks start to get to about a half a tank, I start looking around for gas.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.620]   I have a few gas stations that I regularly frequent because they are consistently the
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.140]   lowest priced.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:45.180]   Here in my region of the country, Racetrack almost always has the cheapest gas.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.740]   They have the best customer service.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   They have beautiful stations.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.940]   They're well lit.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.260]   And so I generally almost always go to a Racetrack.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   That's what I do.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.260]   But for you, you probably know what the gas stations around you are.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.060]   And so make a habit of keeping your gas filled with...
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.780]   Excuse me, your car filled with gas.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.980]   Most vehicles will have a range on them of about 400 miles.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.320]   And if you're filling up your gas tank around a half a tank, you'll usually almost always
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.820]   have a range of about 200 miles.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.300]   And 200 miles will get you out of the problem areas for most disasters.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.820]   It'll at least get you to where you can get more gas.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.300]   So don't be one of these people who runs your tank down to an eighth of a tank and then
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.660]   starts looking around.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.340]   If you get down to a half or a quarter or a third, make sure at that point in time you
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.340]   go ahead and fill up.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:38.400]   It'll buy you some good peace of mind in life to build that and develop that as a habit.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.620]   One benefit of having extra gas tanks and fill up all your cars is that if you stay
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.280]   put and you need gasoline, you can always easily siphon the gasoline out of your gas
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   tank.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.120]   All you need to do is just stick a little piece of tubing down.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.240]   You can start a siphon manually, just with your mouth, a gravity-fed suction siphon.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.600]   Be careful, a mouthful of gasoline is not fun.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.320]   Or you can have a little hand pump made up.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.760]   And if you are one who has a generator and has gas set by for your generator, a siphon
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.000]   should be a standard part of your equipment.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.160]   Go ahead and get some extra water and food, but do it sensibly.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.500]   Best way and cheapest and simplest way to store water is to get cases of water bottles
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.560]   at one of your big box stores, Costco, Sam's, BJ's, etc.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.560]   Especially if you live in a house or you live in an apartment like I do, this will be just
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.240]   your simplest way to do it.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.000]   I primarily have two aspects of being able to provide water for my family.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.760]   One is cases of water bottles and two is a water filter.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:41.200]   At Costco right now, you can buy trays of Kirkland brand water bottles.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.600]   I think they come 40 water bottles to a pack and they're half a liter each, 500 milliliter
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   bottles.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.560]   Costco sells those for about $3.68.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.120]   Let's just say $3.70.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.280]   If you actually look at the numbers on it, there are 5.26 gallons in a case of those
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   water bottles.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.960]   That comes out to be about 70 cents per gallon.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.000]   The most important thing is that these water bottles are in a very convenient form of water.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.720]   I'd much rather have stacks of these cases of water in 500 milliliter bottles than I
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.160]   would have gallons, jugs of water or five gallon jugs of water because they're much
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.360]   more convenient and able to be accessed little by little.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.320]   They're easily able to be distributed.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.280]   If you just have five gallon bottles of water, that's great to be able to store a lot of
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.280]   water simply.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.560]   That'll be the cheapest way if you have five gallon jugs or gallon jugs or soda bottles
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.200]   that you filled up from the tap.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.160]   That'll be cheap, but it's inconvenient for you to be able to give away five gallons at
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   a time.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.800]   But if your neighbor needs water and you have lots of these water bottles, then you have
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.400]   little bottles of water that you can pass along to them.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.560]   The other thing I like about storing water in this methodology is that it is compact
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.200]   and efficient from a spatial perspective.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.500]   So I have in my pantry, I have a shelving unit, one of these robust, strong shelving
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.640]   units that you can buy.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.580]   They're not too expensive.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.160]   But on the bottom of it, I just have stacks of these cases and I have 60 gallons, 60,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.660]   70 gallons of water.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.640]   This just sits there and I always have water available.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.940]   And then the great thing is because these are in a convenient form, they're very convenient
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.020]   to rotate out after a few years.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   Water doesn't go bad.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.300]   When you're talking about things like this for emergency preparations, I'm not going
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:25.060]   to worry too much about the risks of plastic toxicity in water or things like that over
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.060]   time.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.540]   They're very convenient to rotate them out and you can go ahead and get new ones and
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.740]   use them for your picnics or your camping, et cetera.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.620]   So buying flats of these water bottles, although it's not the cheapest thing to do, I don't
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:42.300]   consider 70 cents a gallon and $3.68 to have five gallons of individual half-liter water
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.540]   bottles set by.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.660]   I don't see that as a major problem.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:53.380]   But the other aspect, especially to me living in an apartment, is having a water filter.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.100]   And in our household, we use a water filter that's called a BERKEY, B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.740]   It's very popular.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.000]   Many people have them.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.500]   But what they are is a gravity-fed filtration system.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.660]   And there are no moving parts.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.660]   There's no pumps.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.940]   It's not hooked up to the taff or anything like that.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.900]   So it's very, very simple technology.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.880]   It's got a hopper on the top and you pour the water in and gravity pulls it through
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:20.420]   some filters that are carbon or I don't remember what they're made out of.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.220]   I think they're carbon filters.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:27.580]   And you can add on there additional filters that filter out the fluoride and the chlorine
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.500]   from the water filtration from the water as well.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.760]   So if you live in a city and you're on a city water system and you want to filter out
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.460]   the chlorine from the water and/or the fluoride, then you can add these water filters as well.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.260]   So all of the water that we drink goes through the BERKEY system.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.400]   They're not cheap to buy.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.580]   They're expensive to buy.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.000]   But the cost per gallon is extremely low.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.100]   And the great thing about it is on a day-to-day basis, this will remove, number one, the chlorine
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:58.740]   and the fluoride and also it will remove any potential toxins that get into the city water
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.740]   supply.
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:03.900]   So that way if you get a boil water notice for your area, it's not as damaging to you
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.900]   as it may be to some other people because you've already been filtering the water.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.380]   But another big aspect reason I have it is because it's part of our disaster scenario
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.600]   where let's say that we have a hurricane system and the city water grid is down and I run
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.660]   out of bottled water because living in an apartment, it's hard for me.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.060]   I don't choose to put 50-gallon drums of water down in my basement.
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.060]   I don't have a basement.
[00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.460]   I don't have any place where I can do that.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.020]   If I lived in a place where I had a basement, I would keep 50-gallon drums of water in the
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.620]   basement or outbuilding shed, et cetera.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.700]   If I lived in a place where I could have a stock tank, I would do that.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.580]   If I could have a pond, I would put in a pond.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.060]   But living in an apartment, that's just simply not sensible or practical.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.900]   The risk of my ever needing those things is very, very low and the cost of doing it is
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.820]   much too high.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.060]   But it doesn't mean I still don't need a plan.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:57.520]   So the Berkey is something where if I run out of bottled water, I can literally pour
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.340]   pond water into it and it will make the pond water safe to drink.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.540]   So I have a wagon, a little cart that can be used.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.900]   I know where my closest water sources are for the canals to my house.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.020]   I've got buckets so I can take some buckets and I can put them on my wagon.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.260]   I can go get water out of the pond.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.860]   You pre-filter the sediment out a little bit, put a fabric, use some t-shirts or coffee
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.860]   filters or whatever.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.500]   T-shirts are usually fine.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.940]   Filter out any large sediment and you pour it through the water filter.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.520]   It'll come through gravity fed and it'll render the water safe to drink.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:37.800]   So by using some storage and then some filtration, you wind up with an essentially unlimited
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.700]   water supply for your hurricane preparations and disaster preparations.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:48.100]   Now again, for a hurricane, this is usually not going to be relevant.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.460]   You're going to have the water back in a few days, a week, something like that and there
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.860]   will be options available to you.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   But that's one.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.360]   So a couple of ideas for you of simple practical preparations that are useful in a day-to-day
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.500]   scenario and also useful in a disaster.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.860]   Also prepare for food.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.140]   The key with food is to remember that for a hurricane, you should focus on things that
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.580]   are simple and that are easily consumed.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.400]   We're not talking about the zombie apocalypse and the end of the world as we know it.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.780]   You don't need a bucket of wheat berries to grind up and bake bread in your solar oven
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.940]   for a hurricane.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.900]   Just a little bit of junk food, crackers and whatever junk food that's pre-prepared and
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.220]   pre-packaged and doesn't need refrigeration is perfectly fine and perfectly adequate.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.660]   There are lots of things that you can do that will be uncooked options and this would be
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.660]   ideal.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.380]   Peanut butter and jelly work great for a hurricane.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.020]   They're good, they're tasty, they fill you up.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.900]   They're great.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.580]   Now the thing you see that people do when hurricanes are coming is they rush out and
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.580]   buy a bunch of bread and a bunch of milk.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.340]   Bread and milk don't work all that well for hurricane preparations.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.020]   First of all, milk goes bad if it's non-refrigerated.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.220]   You're likely going to lose power so you're going to lose refrigeration.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.780]   Now your milk is going to go bad.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.260]   Bread molds quickly.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.340]   So my suggestion to you is instead of buying bread, buy tortillas.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.760]   If you go to your store, they sell these at all the grocery stores, you can buy the large
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.060]   packages of, in my area, the brand is Mission.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.200]   Mission flour tortillas.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.140]   These things last weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks without molding.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.540]   They're way cheaper than bread and you can make a great peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.060]   out of them.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.860]   They're delicious just to eat on their own.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:27.860]   Unlike bread, I don't care so much to eat whole wheat bread on its own without something
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.580]   on it, but I don't mind eating a tortilla on its own.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.700]   You can put some salt on it and you can cook it up and fry it up so it's crisp and that
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.380]   makes it a little bit interesting and different.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.120]   You can use it as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.620]   You can put meat and cheese on it.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.340]   They're very, very flexible, very, very cheap.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.780]   They last a long time.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.220]   So think about doing something like that.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.640]   If you're at the grocery store and you need to get some food, look at the tortillas instead
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   of the bread.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.720]   That's what would be my suggestion.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:55.000]   Milk doesn't work very well because of the refrigeration, but if you want to have milk,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.780]   for example, your family eats breakfast cereal, then you can go ahead and buy cereal.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.420]   Cereal's not going to go bad.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.580]   You can buy milk, but don't buy milk in the gallon jug from the refrigerated section.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.140]   Look for what's called UHT milk.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.020]   UHT milk stands for ultra high temperature pasteurized milk.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:18.580]   The brand name in the United States is a brand name called Parmalat, P-A-R-M-A-L-A-T.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.060]   Comes in these white bottles with blue lettering on it.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.740]   You may or may not be able to find it in your area.
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.980]   Sam's Club sells these by the case.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.100]   Costco doesn't, so I have my parents buy the stuff for me from Sam's Club because they're
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.460]   still members there.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.140]   Costco doesn't have it, but you buy the stuff by the case.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.260]   UHT milk is what most of the world lives on.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.180]   Refrigeration is difficult in many parts of the world.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.000]   This ultra high temperature pasteurization is the methodology that they use to be able
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.020]   to have access to milk on the grocery shelves.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.460]   This milk comes in these little, what are they called?
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:51.460]   I think Tetra packs.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.300]   These little cardboard boxes that are foil lined, kind of like boxed wine.
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.140]   Comes in a box similarly.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.420]   You buy this milk and it's shelf stable.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.460]   It'll last for months and months at room temperature.
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.740]   You can set aside a couple of cases of this stuff and then you can use it.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.020]   It comes in small containers that are very practical and usable.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.780]   For a family and cereal, you'll be able to use up a bottle of the milk for breakfast.
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.540]   Once you open it, it does need to be refrigerated, so you need to drink it quickly.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.700]   These are very practical emergency preparations.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:26.860]   It's a very simple way for you to have milk on hand because they come in small containers.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.860]   You can drink them up in one sitting or breakfast and lunch.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.860]   You can have the entire thing.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.860]   It tastes great.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.920]   It doesn't need any refrigeration.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.700]   Most of us in the United States would prefer to have a nice cold glass of milk versus a
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.060]   warm room temperature glass of milk, but it's milk.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.740]   It tastes like milk.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.500]   Don't make any claims as to the health benefits of it.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.820]   It ain't no raw milk, that's for sure.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.940]   You can do your own research on that.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.060]   But for something like a hurricane, it can be a great comfort food.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.820]   It doesn't require refrigeration.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.740]   You can set aside a couple of cases of that and you can use it over time.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.580]   You'll use it at some point.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   We use this.
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.180]   In my family, we don't really drink milk.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:10.140]   Oftentimes, we're cooking and we don't have milk on hand to make the recipe, but I keep
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.780]   a couple of cases of the Parmalat, the UHT milk.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:15.700]   That way, when I need milk, we'll go ahead and grab it.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   I'll use it in the recipe.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.700]   I've got the milk and you can go ahead and work from there.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.440]   Another way to do milk is powdered milk.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.620]   If you're unfamiliar with powdered milk, I grew up drinking some powdered milk from time
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:31.600]   to time because powdered milk is an excellent way to save costs.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.900]   But you can set aside some powdered milk and this is also useful for those of you who cook,
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.940]   which hopefully is all of you, and you want a way to keep some milk on hand that doesn't
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:44.460]   require you to have it refrigerated in the refrigerator.
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.620]   Powdered milk works really well as well.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.900]   Doesn't require refrigeration.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:54.220]   But when thinking about food, think about cheap, uncooked options, boxes of crackers,
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.660]   pre-prepared meals, et cetera.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.960]   Just go around your big box store or Publix and just think about what could I have on
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.100]   hand that doesn't require refrigeration.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.820]   Buy some extra fruit so you have something tasty, et cetera, and you can get yourself
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.660]   through a week with no power pretty simply, even if you don't have any method way to cook.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.420]   Now, hot food is really nice to eat.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   But you need a way to cook it.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:20.660]   So you need to consider a way to be able to cook in the wake of a power outage.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.400]   I have an electric stove.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.220]   So my electric stove is useless.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.900]   And an electric stove requires a tremendous amount of electricity to operate.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.100]   So it's just simply not going to be practical.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.460]   For the majority of you, your primary way to cook should be your simple gas barbecue
[00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.840]   grill that's probably on your back porch.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.380]   So if you have a gas grill, you should make sure that you have your propane tanks filled
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.980]   up and that you always have a couple of extra propane tanks on hand.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.860]   Generally, FYI, it's cheaper to fill your propane tanks than to swap them out.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.580]   You'll get a larger amount of gas at a cheaper price.
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.860]   The major time that you swap them out is just simply if you need to upgrade an old tank
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:02.020]   to a new tank.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.260]   You can go ahead and do that through the swapping procedure.
[00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:08.580]   But go ahead and take your propane tanks down to the local gas station or U-Haul dealership
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.240]   or wherever, camping store, wherever in your area they refill propane and have those things
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   filled up.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   Keep those set by.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.460]   If you have a grill, you can cook most of the things that you want to cook.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.980]   You can grill your meat, which is the first thing to do.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.320]   If you lose power, consider grilling your meat.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.740]   Come back to that in a minute.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:35.380]   And also, many of your gas barbecue stoves will have a side burner that's a propane
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.380]   burner.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:41.140]   You can put a pot on that and cook a nice pot of rice or any other hot food that you
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.460]   have, beans and hot dogs, whatever it is that you have set aside in your canned food stores.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.500]   You have that little side burner on there that can be helpful.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:52.660]   One thing I make, one recommendation I make to people is if you have a grill, consider
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.780]   buying a griddle for your grill.
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:01.740]   A while ago, I got turned on to griddle cooking and I have a portable propane grill.
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.540]   It has three burners on it.
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.580]   It's called a Camp Chef Pro 90.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.460]   It has three propane burners on it.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.100]   And I have a large griddle that sets on top of it.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.740]   And this gives me, like in a restaurant, a large griddle surface that I can use to cook
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.860]   all kinds of food for large groups of people.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.140]   But in my research for that, I've discovered that there are companies that will make a
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.980]   custom-sized griddle for your barbecue grill.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:27.820]   And I've turned a few people on to this and all of them have been very satisfied with
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.820]   it.
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:34.340]   But what it is, it's a sheet of carbon steel or steel that you put down on your grill and
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.980]   it turns your grill surface into a griddle, which is useful because now your propane grill
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:44.580]   will be very efficient for you to be able to make eggs, bacon, pancakes on.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:48.460]   If you want to have a nice Saturday morning breakfast outside or you want to cook for
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.260]   a lot of people, it's also useful for you to be able to make a stir fry or make fried
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.700]   rice and all these things on.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.860]   And it can be useful as part of your emergency preparations.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.820]   If you're facing a storm next week or this week, you're not going to be able to get a
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.180]   griddle made in time.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180]   But consider that.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:06.940]   Do some research online for a griddle that'll go on top of your propane grill.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.940]   Very, very useful.
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.060]   Also, it's good to have a backup.
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.740]   So many of you will have a camping stove of some kind.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.580]   I have one of those little Coleman stoves, two burner Coleman camping stoves, and I just
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.940]   keep a supply of little two pound propane tank bottles set by.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.980]   So that way, you've got a couple of backups, got a couple of ways to be able to cook.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.900]   If you have a charcoal grill, make sure that you set aside some bags of charcoal.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.180]   Charcoal grill work great, but set aside some bags of charcoal.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:37.340]   If you have the need to cook, incidentally, and you make sure that you can cook very efficiently
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.840]   with a small amount of charcoal.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.460]   So if you have a few bags of charcoal set by, then you can use that.
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.940]   If you don't, you can use it in a grill or whatever, and you could just put a pan or
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.940]   a pot on top of that.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.180]   In much of the world, you go around, you see that people make their business.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.740]   One of the businesses that you see is street food.
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:49:01.180]   The way that many people do it is they take a wheel from a car and they use that wheel
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.740]   and turn that into a little mini charcoal grill.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:08.420]   Use a few pieces of charcoal, light it up, get it going, and you can cook in a skillet
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   over that.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.940]   You can roast over that.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:14.140]   A little bit of charcoal can work very, very well.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.780]   If you lose power, a couple of things you want to consider.
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.260]   Start with keeping your refrigerator and your freezer closed.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.120]   And when you're in the middle of a storm, this is your best thing to do.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.340]   Keep things closed.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.860]   Also, if you've lost power, consider doing something to help with the insulation for
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.540]   your refrigerator and your freezer.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.220]   Consider some blankets or sleeping bags around them.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.500]   Wrap them up to keep the cold in and the heat out.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:43.060]   One thing that you can do if you have a freezer especially, or if you have a refrigerator
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:47.260]   and you're heading into a storm, make sure that you go ahead and put in things that are
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.540]   very dense, things like a gallon jugs of water.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.260]   Leave a little bit of room on top so they can freeze, and you can go ahead and freeze
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.780]   these gallon jugs of water in your freezer.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:02.060]   And that will serve as a cooler and it'll keep your freezer cold for a longer period
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   of time.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.460]   In a minute, we'll talk about how to keep your freezer cold without power.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.180]   But for now, if you assume that it's just simply going to ... you're not going to have
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.980]   power, then just try to keep it closed.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.060]   Minimize the opening and closing of it.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.300]   Don't allow the kids to go in there.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.420]   Just do it one time real quick, in and out.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.900]   Get your stuff and do it all at once.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.140]   That will be very helpful to you.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.180]   If you feel like you're going to lose food, start by eating all the food that's going
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   to go bad first.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.940]   So eat your ice cream.
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:30.660]   Get out the big bowls and eat the ice cream before it melts.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.860]   Start grilling your meat.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.780]   If you lose power, bring out the meat and start grilling it little by little.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.060]   That's where you can have a nice big barbecue, throw a big barbecue for the neighbors if
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   you have too much meat.
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.180]   But don't let stuff go bad.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.920]   Grill it and share it.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.220]   Other people will be happy for it.
[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:51.300]   And that's the best thing to do with it in the wake of a storm, is don't let it go bad.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:59.220]   If you are looking at things and you're considering things, don't be stupid and just start throwing
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.540]   things away because they simply got warm.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:07.540]   Remember, cows are not kept at 12 degrees Fahrenheit when they're alive.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.500]   Things don't spoil instantly.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:14.300]   You'll start to hear food safety regulations and things shared around that says, "Okay,
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.180]   if your food has been above 40 degrees, you got to throw it out," or whatever the number
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.060]   is that's being used.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.540]   Don't do that.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.620]   Use your common sense and use your eyes and your nose.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:28.820]   So look at things and think about what is this good or is this not.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.420]   Trust your nose and trust your eyes to tell you if something is good or something is not.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.340]   If something is spoiled, you'll know it.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.380]   If you're concerned about something being spoiled, just make sure that you cook it well
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.380]   enough.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.400]   And remember that people throughout history have been eating all kinds of things that
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:48.060]   are not perfectly refrigerated and they've figured out how to get through it.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:52.100]   So cook things well if you're concerned about it and trust your eyes and your nose.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.260]   Throw away something that your eyes and your nose tells you is bad.
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:58.100]   Don't just follow an arbitrary rule.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:02.220]   When you're cooking things, I meant to say this a moment ago under the cooking section,
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.780]   it's helpful to conserve energy.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.600]   So if you only have a little bit of gas, for example, you don't have three backup propane
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.260]   tanks and all of a sudden you've got one that's only half full and you're concerned about
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.260]   it.
[00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.980]   Think about efficiency with your cooking.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.400]   So cook with an efficient pot, for example.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:23.540]   Use a pot that's a heavy material and very, very thick and very efficient so it'll retain
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   the heat.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.140]   Use that instead of a thin and flimsy pot.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:31.580]   Consider using something like the hay box or straw box method of cooking.
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.660]   The idea here is if you want to cook something, you can heat up your pot to the appropriate
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.580]   temperature, get it hot, and then you put it into an insulated container.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.380]   The historical one that used to be done with a hay box where you take a box and you wrap
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.500]   it up with straw.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.980]   You put your food in there, cover it with towels and blankets.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:51.240]   And the insulating properties of that keep the food warm and help it to keep cooking
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:56.220]   without you continually putting more power into it and using up your fuel and your energy
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.220]   reserves.
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:59.380]   Today, you can easily substitute a cooler.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:05.500]   So if I only had a little bit of fuel, first I would cook with a big pot and I would make
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.500]   a big pot of rice.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.780]   I've got canned beans set aside.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.620]   I just need to cook a big pot of rice.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.660]   So bring it up to the temperature.
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   Make a big pot.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   Bring it up to the temperature.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:18.300]   And then as soon as I've got it boiling with rice, I would put it into a cooler and wrap
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.300]   it up with towels, close the lid on the cooler, stuff the whole thing full, get the insulation
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.980]   as best as possible, and then leave it in the cooler to do all the cooking without leaving
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.260]   it on the heat and using up more fuel.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.860]   And if you keep it insulated, you'll be able to get more cooking done using this methodology.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.780]   It'll take a little bit longer, but it'll use far less fuel.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.900]   So think about conserving fuel.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.420]   Now here's the simplest way to prepare in advance to keep your house functioning without
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.620]   power.
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:46.380]   And that's simply to use your car to power your house.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.500]   Again, I learned this from Stephen Harris.
[00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.860]   And after years of having generators and dealing with generators, I realized the ingenuity
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.860]   of his solution.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.860]   The idea is this.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:59.620]   Many people buy generators, and generators are great.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   Generators have their place as part of your emergency backup systems.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.860]   The challenge with generators, especially as regards something like a hurricane, is
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.740]   people don't maintain the generators properly.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.100]   They don't run them regularly.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.960]   So the carburetor has fuel in it.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.780]   The fuel varnishes, and the generator becomes unusable because they didn't run it regularly.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.460]   People don't treat the gas in it.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.180]   So the gas goes bad and damages the generator.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.740]   Most people don't store fuel for the generator.
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.620]   It's completely absurd to see how many people will go and buy a $500 generator and one five
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:35.620]   gallon can of gas, which won't even last them, maybe last them a few hours.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:42.540]   Far better to have a $50 generator and $450 of gas than a $500 generator and five gallons
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.900]   of gas, whatever that money winds up being.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.220]   So generators have their place, and they're certainly great to have, but they don't necessarily
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.340]   need to be the first step for many people.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:57.420]   And here in South Florida, my power grid is very, very stable.
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.580]   I don't have the problems that some of you have in other parts of the country where power
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.060]   goes away regularly.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:06.560]   So I no longer – actually, I do have a new generator on my camper van, which is part
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.340]   of my backups.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:10.700]   But for a while now, I haven't had a generator.
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:18.420]   I got rid of my generators when I sold my other house to downsize into an apartment.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.120]   And so the major plan that I've had is just simply to use a power inverter.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.340]   So if you look at your car sitting in the driveway, you can picture that car as a generator
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:30.740]   because you have an engine and you have an electrical system that creates electricity,
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.700]   feeds a battery, and that engine is something you've paid thousands of dollars for.
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.980]   It's probably something that's in excellent shape or it's well-maintained.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.940]   It's got a nice gas tank that's pretty big that's attached to it.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.760]   You've got a really great generator sitting in your driveway already.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:50.460]   You don't need to trot down to Sam's or Home Depot and buy yourself a generator unnecessarily.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.740]   Start with the one that you have sitting in your driveway.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   In order for you to use that generator, however, you need to buy something called an inverter.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:01.360]   An inverter, you'll picture this, many of you, as something that you plug into the cigarette
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:06.140]   lighter that allows you to plug your household appliances in in the car.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   Useful travel tip.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.460]   You can't usually do this with a cigarette lighter, but you can do something like if
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:12.620]   you have an inverter hooked up where you've got enough voltage, you can do something like
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.220]   use a crockpot in the car.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:18.020]   So a good way to save money while you're traveling across the country is set up a crockpot
[00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.540]   or other similar slow cooker in the car, and you can cook a hot meal while you're driving
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:23.540]   down the road.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:26.980]   And then instead of stopping and spending $40 at a fast food restaurant, you can pull
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.460]   over to the rest area on the side of the highway, and you can have a nice hot cooked meal right
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:36.700]   there from the crockpot that cooked while you were driving down the road in your car.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.940]   So an inverter is a way of accessing the battery's energy and turning it into alternating current,
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.820]   110 volt alternating current, which is the system that your house works on if you're
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:49.620]   in the United States.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.620]   What you need is the type of inverter that doesn't plug into the cigarette lighter because
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.940]   the voltage that you can access out of the cigarette lighter is very low.
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:59.620]   What you need is the type of inverter that you can access because you plug it in directly
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.060]   to your battery.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.340]   You connect it with a couple of clamps onto your battery.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:08.740]   And one of these inverters, you can get an 800 watt or a 1200 watt.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:09.740]   I have a couple of them.
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:11.460]   I have one 800 and one 1200 watt.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:16.900]   These inverters will be very useful and you can use them to run a little at a time the
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.420]   different things that you have in your house.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:24.300]   So you can use this to actually run something like your refrigerator and your freezer.
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.980]   The way that you want to do this is when you're running something that has a high current
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.780]   draw, you want to keep your car on during that period of time so the alternator is charging
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.780]   the battery.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:39.540]   So you park your car in your driveway, you plug on your clamps, the clamps from the inverter
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:43.380]   onto the battery, and then you run an extension cord into your house.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:47.340]   What you should do is you plug in your refrigerator and run it for a short period of time, an
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.820]   hour, something like that.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.000]   Let it get down to temperature and then you unplug it again.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.020]   Keep it closed, keep it insulated, but you keep it unplugged.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:58:00.380]   Then you can turn your car off for another four, five, six hours, something like that.
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:06.820]   Then go ahead and plug it back in, turn the car on, plug the refrigerator on, and go again,
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.180]   cool it down again.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:13.220]   Using this methodology, you can keep your refrigerator, your freezer cold and functioning
[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:17.420]   using simply your car for many days if you have a full tank of gas.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.020]   Turn it on, run the car for an hour, cool it down, and you're good to go.
[00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:24.180]   Now, you should also be able to run some other things.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:28.620]   So if you think about what you need in the wake of a power outage, your needs are very
[00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:29.620]   basic.
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.780]   You need some lights, you need a fan here in Florida because it's very hot and humid
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.180]   after hurricanes.
[00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:38.020]   That's usually the worst, no air conditioning and no fans.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.140]   You need some simple fans.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:44.100]   You need the ability to charge up your cell phone, perhaps to charge any other batteries
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.460]   that you use as well.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.060]   So you can do that with the inverter.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.860]   You don't have to run the car for that.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:54.340]   You can just simply use the inverter and drain the battery down a little bit.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:57.500]   Make sure that you don't drain it down too much, but you can use it to drain it down
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:59:02.440]   some and run the car every few hours in order to charge the battery up.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.180]   This is the best way to keep your house going without you needing to go out and buy a several
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.180]   hundred dollar generator.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.340]   Very, very simple.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.740]   Anyone can start with this.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.700]   I will again link to Stephen Harris' information on this.
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:19.060]   He has an entire audio show that he recorded on the Survival Podcast about how to do this.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.060]   He's the expert.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.500]   I'm just giving you the idea.
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.820]   Those of you who are technologically savvy can take it and run with it just based upon
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.220]   what I've said here.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.580]   I'll link to a couple of inverters.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.020]   I have a Cobra inverter.
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.420]   I'll link to that in the show notes and I'll also link to Stephen Harris' websites where
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.740]   he links all the stuff.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:39.340]   He is way more detail oriented than I am about going through and researching this stuff.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:42.260]   It's not my area of interest.
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:46.940]   This is a good way for you to start and just simply cycle this on and off.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:52.180]   You can with a full tank of gas, you can be fine probably for four or five days, maybe
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:57.540]   even a week without just using your car to keep things going.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:02.820]   Stephen Harris says that the calculation that most cars can idle for about 24 hours on one
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.820]   tank of gas.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:08.140]   If you figure that let's say you're idling your car for about four hours a day, first
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.220]   thing in the morning when you wake up for an hour, middle of the day, another time mid-afternoon
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.340]   and the last thing at night before you go to bed.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.980]   If that's 24 hours a day, that gets you through six days of idling your car just with the
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.860]   gases in the gas tank, let alone any extra gas.
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:24.860]   Really great option.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:25.900]   Very, very practical.
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.220]   You don't have to buy a generator.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:31.340]   That'll get you through the vast majority of things like hurricanes.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.140]   If you're preparing for a hurricane, now's the time to charge up your batteries.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:39.840]   I use rechargeable batteries in all of my kids' toys and all the flashlights, things
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.180]   like that.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:45.460]   Whether you have some of the newer battery technology, if you have a newer flashlight
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.420]   or whether you just have AA's.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:53.140]   I try to standardize everything, flashlights, toys, et cetera, in my house on AA's.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.460]   AA's have a good amount of energy in them and I use rechargeable Panasonic Eneloop batteries.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:03.740]   This is a nickel metal hydride battery that lasts and can be charged a couple thousand
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.900]   times.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.780]   Way better than some of the old rechargeable battery technology.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.980]   They're not cheap to buy, but they last.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.240]   So I use these in flashlights, headlamps, et cetera.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.060]   So get out the battery charger, charge up all the batteries, get ready to go in case
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.780]   you need all these flashlights.
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.020]   Your kids will be using the flashlights a tremendous amount.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.680]   They're lying around in the dark to read books and to play with games.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.160]   So this is the time to charge up batteries, charge up phones, charge up Game Boys, charge
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.100]   up all of these things.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.920]   Charge up your car batteries if you got the chance.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.460]   One little financial tip for you is if you keep your battery regularly charged on your
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.700]   car, that will help your car batteries to last.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.660]   Now most of the time we're just simply driving around and the more you drive, that'll be
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.660]   good.
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.540]   The thing that kills the life of a battery is being discharged all the way and then having
[01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.820]   to be charged up again.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.920]   So if you want to maintain the life of your battery, you want to keep it charged as the
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.180]   highest point possible.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:59.540]   Now of course you own the battery to use it, but the premise and the fundamental basis
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:04.700]   of battery life is keep the battery charged up to the highest point possible.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:08.880]   So if you want to help your car batteries to last a little bit longer, the mechanics
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.700]   say that one of the best things to do is to keep them consistently charged.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:17.980]   What you want to get is a smart battery charger, an intelligent battery charger that clamps
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.240]   onto the battery and charges it up.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.360]   One brand that is really, really great is a brand called CTEK.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.020]   C-T-E-K, I'll link to it in the show notes.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:31.680]   But the CTEK battery charger is these very small intelligent chargers and if you put
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.780]   one of them on your batteries once a month and charge it up once a month, that will help
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.160]   your car batteries to last longer than they otherwise would.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.160]   Well if you have a battery charger like that, make sure that your car batteries are all
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.560]   charged up.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.040]   Incidentally, one of the things that Stephen Harris teaches that I think is a really great
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:53.520]   idea as well is setting aside a simple – using a deep cycle battery and using that in your
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.880]   house as a simple battery backup system.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.080]   I'm waiting for all of the Tesla batteries, Elon Musk's batteries to work really great
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.140]   and be in every household.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:07.080]   But until then, one deep cycle battery set aside and kept charged up can do a tremendous
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:13.780]   amount for your household utility with lights and a little bit of fan and et cetera.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:20.680]   Set aside in a closet, it can be tremendously useful to you in times of power outage.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:26.320]   So those are some very simple, very practical ideas for you with regard to preparing for
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   a hurricane.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.720]   Now, finally, I'll close with this.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.640]   If you're not in the path of Matthew, which many thousands of you are simply because you've
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.200]   got basically the entire eastern seaboard and you got a category 4 hurricane coming,
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.800]   who knows, but that affects a lot of people living on the eastern seaboard of the United
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   States.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.960]   But if you're not in the path of Matthew, make sure that you think about a scenario
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.800]   like the one I've described.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.320]   Anytime you see disaster strike other people, think about it and then prepare for that same
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.640]   disaster to hit you.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.040]   If you're at a funeral for somebody's loved one that died, then you should be thinking
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.180]   about what would happen to my family if I were the one that were dead or if my wife
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.120]   were the one that were dead or my kids were the one that were dead.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.480]   How would we get through that?
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:18.160]   And what would I need to do now to make that circumstance a little bit easier?
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.720]   So think about that.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.720]   If you see somebody who's facing a hurricane, think about, "Well, if I faced a hurricane,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.940]   what would I need to do?"
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.240]   Take these ideas and think about them in your own application.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.640]   If you see somebody whose house burns down from a house fire, think about that.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.580]   If you see somebody who's flooded out like the people in Iowa right now or the ones in
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:39.400]   Louisiana a few weeks ago, think about how would that affect me.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.320]   Sit down and at least go through the mental exercise of jotting out some notes for a plan
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.600]   because these things are always weathered better if you've prepared in advance.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:54.680]   And use the impetus, the motivation to increase your own levels of preparation for the circumstances
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.520]   that life throws at you.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:03.560]   And if you do this, one of those most powerful beneficial aspects of it is that you will
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.720]   be prepared in such a way that you can go out and help others.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   Because no matter how great this show hopefully was for you, there are many hundreds of thousands
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.320]   of people who will never come across or seek out information like this.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.160]   And those people need a helping hand.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.040]   My heart aches for the people in Haiti.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:28.760]   Having been to Haiti and traveled there, I can understand firsthand how utterly devastating
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.160]   it is for people there.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.680]   Or in Cuba, same thing.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.320]   This storm will be utterly devastating for them.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.840]   And it will be devastating in terms of loss of life, but it will be also devastating in
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.960]   terms of loss of lifestyle.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:50.120]   Because when a storm goes through, dealing with the after effects, it just goes deep.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.720]   So if you are prepared and if you're strong and you're coming from a place of strength,
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.160]   then you'll be able to reach out a helping hand and help your neighbors.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.620]   If you've got plenty of water set by and you have a water filter, you won't be looking
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.480]   at your store of water and thinking, "Is it going to last?"
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.440]   You'll be able to go across the street to your neighbor and say, "Here's a case of water
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.720]   bottles."
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:16.520]   If you've got a battery charger in your back pocket and your neighbor's wandering around
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.600]   with their cord desperately looking for an outlet to plug in, you can just say, "Hey,
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.360]   here, plug in here."
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:29.200]   So one of the major reasons for you to be prepared for natural disasters, events like
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:34.720]   this, et cetera, is that you'll be able to reach out a helping hand to somebody else.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:41.060]   And that'll build a relationship, that'll build community, and that'll build strength
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:45.540]   and resilience in your neighborhood.
