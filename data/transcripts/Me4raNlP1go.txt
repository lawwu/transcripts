[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   I would like to call your attention this morning to two portions of New Testament Scripture.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   The first is in the Gospel according to St. John, in the first chapter, verses 12 and
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   13.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.320]   "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.840]   them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.240]   flesh, nor of the will of men, but of God."
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.920]   And again in the epistle to the Hebrews, in chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to verse
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   29.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.920]   Verses 23 to 29 in the 11th chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.320]   "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.000]   saw he was a proper child, and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.760]   daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.240]   treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.080]   By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured as seeing
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.340]   him who is invisible.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.680]   Through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.640]   the firstborn should touch them.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians, as saying
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.480]   to do, were drowned."
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.400]   Now those who attend here regularly will realize why I am putting those two portions of scripture
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.520]   together.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.880]   We are primarily and fundamentally concerned about that statement in the first chapter
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:18.120]   of the Gospel according to St. John, where we are reminded that the Son of God, the eternal
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.200]   Word, was made flesh in order that we who believe in him might have the right and the
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.160]   authority to become the children of God.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.760]   And we are concerned about that.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.280]   We have gone into the meaning and the content of it, and we are concerned at the moment
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.360]   on this aspect of the question.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720]   We are meant to know this.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.400]   We are meant to enjoy it.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.760]   It seems to me that the greatest need in the Church at the present time is that people
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.880]   who claim to be Christian should be sure and certain of their salvation and of the fact
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.720]   that they are the children of God.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.280]   The New Testament itself gives great attention to this.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.480]   There is a sense in which it can be argued that all the New Testament epistles were rarely
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.960]   written with that end and object in view, to give people certainty and assurance in
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.840]   order that they might fight the good fight of faith, might worthily represent their Lord,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.120]   and might enjoy the blessings of salvation as they did so.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.600]   But now we are turning to this eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, because here
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.200]   the author, having outlined the great doctrine of assurance in the early chapters of the
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.440]   epistle, comes now to give them some practical help and comfort and consolation by holding
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.920]   before them some of the great figures of the Old Dispensation, the Old Testament.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.640]   And his object is, as I say, in order to give them some practical help and encouragement.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.960]   He is saying this in effect.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.400]   He says your position as Hebrew Christians is a very difficult one, but there is nothing
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.960]   new about this.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   God's people have always had a difficult time in this world.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   They have always been pilgrims and strangers.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   They have always had to fight the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.800]   So that what is happening to you, he says, is nothing new.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.320]   And then he takes them one by one and he holds them up before them, as if to say, now then
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320]   look at this man.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.960]   Here is a man like yourself.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.720]   He was a man of like passions.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   He was flesh and blood.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   He was heir to all the difficulties.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.620]   But look what he did.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.960]   What enabled him to do so?
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.440]   And he tells us that in every single case the explanation was their faith.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.280]   All these men triumphed by faith.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.320]   He says in the second verse, by it, that is to say by faith, the elders obtained a good
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   report.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   And by faith he means this assurance.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.440]   Faith he says is the substance of things hoped for.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.840]   It is the evidence of things not seen.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   In other words, it is of vital importance that we should understand that this is a great
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.760]   chapter on assurance of salvation.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:44.200]   Not a vague uncertain belief, not a mere hoping, but an assured certain knowledge of the things
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.200]   which they believe.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.000]   Now then, that has been the case with all the examples that we have looked at hitherto.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.280]   And now this morning we come to this particular case of Moses.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.680]   And you will have noticed as you have read this chapter that the two men to whom the
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.320]   greatest amount of space and attention is given are Abraham and Moses.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800]   And that of course is not a bit surprising.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.040]   Abraham was the father of the nation.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.600]   As Abraham is described in the New Testament as the father of the faith and the father
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:30.920]   of the faithful, so that it is natural that he should be given the prominence which we
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.920]   have already seen as we have considered his case.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.720]   And the other I say is Moses.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   And he is of great importance because he is the great law giver.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.040]   The one to whom God gave the law that he might give it to the people.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   And of course he is a pivotal character in the whole story of the children of Israel.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.600]   These are the two outstanding men.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.160]   The third, the possible third, is David, and references made to him later on.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.880]   Now these are the men in particular to whom the Hebrews always looked back.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.840]   Abraham our father, and Moses the great law giver, the one who led them out of the captivity
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.520]   of Egypt into the new and the promised land of Canaan.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.800]   So that it is not surprising that he takes up the case of Moses and that he deals with
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.640]   it in a fair amount of detail.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.600]   Now I again must impress upon your minds this important principle.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.320]   The man is not rarely concerned about the details of these people's lives.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   That's not what he's interested in.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.720]   He is rarely interested in the thing that made them what they were.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.280]   And that is this whole question of assurance.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.200]   And this, he tells us, is the whole secret.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:02.600]   Now oftentimes this chapter gets misused because that vital principle has not been borne in
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   mind.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.280]   Take for instance what we were dealing with last Sunday morning, where we were dealing
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.280]   with the trial of Abraham when God called upon him to sacrifice his son Isaac.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.720]   How often has that been dealt with in this sort of way, as an appeal and an exhortation?
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.080]   Have you sacrificed your Isaac?
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.120]   And great pressure is brought to bear upon us to sacrifice our Isaac.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.380]   And we are told if only we do that, then we shall have this great blessing.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.680]   But that, as I am trying to show, is a complete misunderstanding and an utter misuse of this
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   chapter.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's really the other way around.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.680]   The way in which this chapter puts it is this.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:56.320]   It was because of their faith and their assurance that these men were able to do these things.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.060]   It was because of his assurance that Abraham was able to offer up his Isaac.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.840]   So you don't start with the offering up of the Isaac.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.340]   The thing to concentrate on is to get assurance, to make certain of your faith.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.760]   The teaching is that if you have the faith of Abraham, if you have the assurance that
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.960]   Abraham had, then if ever you should find yourself called upon to offer your Isaac,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   you'll be able to do it.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.440]   You don't start by offering your Isaac and then get your blessing.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.120]   No, no, you get your great blessing first, and then you're able even to face the test
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.440]   of having to offer up your Isaac.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   Now that is the way to look at it.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.680]   And it is tragic that so often it has been entirely misunderstood, and people spend their
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.120]   lifetime in trying to offer up their Isaacs in order that they may get a great blessing.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.840]   That's to reverse the teaching of the entire chapter.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:58.640]   Now we shall see that same thing emerging in the case of Moses, which we are now examining.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.960]   The thing therefore that we must be concerned about this morning is the assurance of Moses.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:12.640]   Because it was on the ground of this assurance that he was able to do the astounding things
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   that he did.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.040]   Very well, let's look at it like this.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.760]   What did he do?
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.480]   Well, we are told here of some of the things he did.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.400]   You'll find the great story given in the book of Exodus, one of the greatest stories
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.880]   not only in the Bible but in the whole of literature.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   What did he do?
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.360]   Well, here are some of the things, let me just note them.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:44.080]   We are reminded here that he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.520]   And what that means is this, that up to a given point he had been called the son of
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.140]   Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.960]   You remember how he was born at a time when the edict had gone out that all the male children
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.580]   born to the Hebrews were to be put to death.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.800]   Only this little child was born.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.400]   And we are told here that he was hid for three months of his parents because they saw that
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   he was a proper child, which means that he was a very beautiful child.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.120]   They looked at this newborn babe and they saw what a beautiful child, we can't possibly
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.200]   put him to death.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.120]   So they hid him, you remember, amongst the reeds and the rushes and the river.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:29.280]   And there he was discovered by the daughter of Pharaoh and she brought him up, sent him
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.720]   to his own mother to bring him up, but she regarded him as her own son and so did Pharaoh
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.280]   and so did everybody else.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.040]   He was known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.120]   She adopted him, gave him all the privileges and all the wonderful prospects.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.980]   There was never a man who had a more shining or glorious career ahead of him than this
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.280]   man Moses.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:12:00.920]   But what we are told here is this, that at a given point, when he was come to years,
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:07.360]   and actually that means when he became forty years of age, for forty years he had been
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.520]   known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter and had enjoyed all the privileges of the palace
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.600]   and all the associated power with all the same glorious prospects ahead.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.880]   At the age of forty, he suddenly renounced it all.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.760]   That's what it means.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.360]   He made a great decision and he is no longer going to be known as the son of Pharaoh's
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   daughter.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.360]   What else?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:39.600]   Well, he is going to identify himself with people who are nothing but slaves in an abject
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.760]   condition of slavery and of suffering.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.360]   That's what it means, that he lays aside all that belonged to him and identifies himself,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:57.720]   becomes one of this people of Israel who are in this terrible position of slavery.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:05.120]   And of course, in addition to that, as you noticed, he even risked his life.
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:12.000]   He suddenly found one of these Egyptians abusing one of his own fellow countrymen and he suddenly
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.760]   decided he must do something about this.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:20.160]   He slew the Egyptian and buried him in the sand, but unfortunately it was seen and observed
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.520]   and so Moses had to escape for his life.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:29.960]   The point I am emphasizing is that he risked his very life for the sake of his people.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.840]   Not only gave up his great position, but even risked his life and he became a humble shepherd
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.080]   in the land of Midian.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.040]   It is very difficult for us to take this in.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.560]   How a man from all the learning and the pomp and the show of the palace of the Pharaoh
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:53.760]   should suddenly become just a humble shepherd, looking after a flock of sheep, moving them
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.160]   from one pasture to another, and a mere nobody in a foreign land.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.240]   It is a remarkable thing, but he humbled himself to that and went on doing that.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   But here is the next thing I want to emphasize.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.680]   It is something that we do not always realize.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.920]   He then decided to leave that happy life of a shepherd.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:26.480]   I say it was a happy life because it was a life of safety, a life of comparative ease,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.160]   a life which did not involve him in any trouble.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.280]   It is a simple life, that life of a shepherd.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.440]   But at a given point, you remember, this man left all that again and took upon himself
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:47.880]   at the behest of God a life that was to be full of risks and of dangers, a life demanding
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:54.680]   constant thought and meditation and the facing of the most difficult and involved problems.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   Now, I am emphasizing this for this reason, that sometimes, you know, it is more difficult
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.000]   to give up a life of ease than it is to give up a great position.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.320]   It depends upon your temperament, of course, and upon your nature.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.280]   But these two types of men are in most of us.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.720]   The greatness and the pomp may appeal to us, but then we may be lazy also, and we say anything
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.760]   for an easy life.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.600]   You have given up that life, that first life, you have taken up this second, and, well,
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.120]   you have decided, "I am going to spend the rest of my life here."
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.280]   Perhaps, after all, it is much better.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.000]   It is an easier life than the life of the palace, and I am not involved in these high
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.120]   decisions.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.720]   I can just go on looking after these sheep and meditating, writing poetry if I feel so
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   disposed.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.360]   What a wonderful life this is, not the life of a city, but the quiet life of the country.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.080]   But suddenly the call comes to get out of that, and that can be much more difficult
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   than the other.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.520]   But Moses responded to that also.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.560]   He enters into one of the most difficult and involved and trying lives that a man has ever
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.560]   lived.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.080]   Let me hurry with this list of the things he did.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.160]   The next thing we see him doing is defying the great Pharaoh.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.640]   He was even risking his life by going back at all, but he did not stop at that.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.920]   He stood up to him.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.960]   He spoke to him.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.340]   He defied him.
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.160]   He uttered the message of God to him without any fear whatsoever.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.480]   We are told here that he did not fear the wrath of the king.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   What boldness!
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.560]   And he was a meek man, the meekest man of all, the Bible tells us.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.760]   A naturally nervous man, a man who was diffident, lacking in self-confidence.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320]   The record makes it quite clear.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.080]   But he stands boldly before this mighty Pharaoh and is not afraid of him.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:50.220]   Not only that, he kept the Passover, killed the lambs, you remember, and painted the blood
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.680]   upon the dog posts and the lintels, and marched out the people of Israel, though he knew that
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.400]   they would be followed by the hosts and the chariots of Pharaoh.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.840]   Out they went.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.120]   And what is still more amazing to me about Moses is this.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.000]   Not merely that he defied the might and the power of a Pharaoh and all his hosts, but
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.880]   that he was able to do it with the mob that he was leading, with the children of Israel
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.240]   who were always ready to grumble and complain, always wanting to be turned back, always losing
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.800]   hope and whimpering and crying, the fickleness of the children of Israel.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.240]   Moses led them out in spite of these two difficulties.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.360]   And the final thing that is put before us here is this, that he led them through the
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.360]   Red Sea.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.600]   By faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.960]   It was the faith of Moses, not of the children of Israel.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.160]   You remember that most dramatic incident, I think, in the whole of the Bible.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.720]   He has led them out, and on they go, and suddenly they find themselves in this position, mountain
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.360]   on one side, mountain on the other, peer higher up, Baal Zephiel.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.600]   In front of them, Red Sea.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.520]   Behind, Pharaoh and his hosts.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   What can they do?
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.120]   Absolutely hemmed in, shut down, impossible.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:20.360]   But it was at that tremendous moment that Moses was able to obey the command of the
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:27.600]   Lord, which was, "Speak to the children of Israel that they go forward."
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.680]   And he gave the command, and on they went through the Red Sea.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:38.400]   Well, now, there is just a list of the things that this man, Moses, did.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.120]   We are reminded of these details.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.560]   But now let's follow the method of the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, and let's
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.640]   see why he gives us these details about Moses.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.480]   Well, this is what he's doing.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.160]   There I've told you of what Moses did.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.600]   But let me put secondly this.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.880]   What was it that made him do it?
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.480]   What made him do all this that he did?
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:11.840]   And here we are told in a very interesting and most important manner.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   And this is, of course, the essential teaching of this whole chapter.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.640]   He didn't do it as the result of obeying an intuition.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.400]   He didn't do it because he had some odd feeling or instinct.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.720]   He didn't plunge into action with some sort of hunch.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.880]   No, no, that's not Christianity.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.320]   What made him do all this was the result of a very definite process.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.280]   It's put here in two very vital words.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.000]   Here they are.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Choosing.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.600]   Choosing, rather, to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.000]   of sin for a season.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Then the second word, esteeming.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.160]   Esteeming the reproach of Christ.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.560]   Greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.240]   the reward.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:09.440]   Choosing, esteeming, deeming, calculating, counting.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.560]   The apostle Paul uses the same word exactly when he talks about himself in Philippians
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:20.680]   3, where he says, "Whosoever things were gained to me, them I count at loss for Christ.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   Yea, and I do count all things but loss and as dunk."
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   He's counting.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   He's esteeming.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920]   He's deeming.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   He's calculating.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.400]   He's working it out.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.640]   Now then, there is the key to this whole matter.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:42.320]   In other words, to put it in the form of principles, there are two great principles here.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.600]   The Christian is a man who is always in the position of considering two alternatives.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:53.880]   Now, this is a very important point because it's a very valuable test that we can all
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.000]   apply to ourselves.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.200]   When I say two alternatives, of course I'm speaking in an ultimate sense.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.600]   Everybody is in a position now and again of either this or that.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.160]   I don't mean that.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:13.880]   I mean that there are two big possibilities always before the Christian, and that is only
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.400]   true of the Christian.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.280]   The man who is not a Christian doesn't know anything about these two alternatives.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.400]   He only knows one thing.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.720]   He only knows the worldly view of life.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.400]   Of course, there are many possibilities in that, but that's not what we are concerned
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   about.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.080]   They're all of the world.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.160]   They belong to that realm and to that category.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.640]   He may be in difficulties which of two cars to buy, which of two houses to buy.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.200]   It's all right, but it's, you see, it's all in the same realm.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.640]   But the Christian sees two ways.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.520]   He's looking at two gates, a straight gate, a wide gate, a narrow way, a broad way, a
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.600]   way that leads to life, a way that leads to destruction, a spiritual way, a carnal, worldly,
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   earthly way.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:15.040]   The Christian is always aware of the two great possibilities in life.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.400]   In other words, he can see that there are two big, total possibilities for him, which
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.400]   cover the whole of his life and his every activity.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:33.480]   Now, you see how Moses was face to face with the two possibilities constantly.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:41.360]   Son of Pharaoh's daughter, the life of the people of God, remaining here as a shepherd
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:48.960]   in the wilderness, enjoying life, getting through with it, the call of God.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.440]   And you see, it involved him in a total decision.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.320]   The whole man and all his circumstances and everything were involved.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.280]   Now, here are the two things that stand out, as they do with all these other men, and as
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.120]   they always do with every Christian.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:11.240]   The Christian is a man, then I say, who is always facing these two calls, these two possibilities.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.920]   God and the devil, heaven and hell, the spiritual life, the worldly life.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   He is aware of this, and he is always having to esteem and to calculate and to reckon.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:31.600]   But the second principle is that the Christian always evaluates everything in the light of
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   the gospel.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.440]   That's his standard.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.680]   That was the secret of Moses.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.280]   I say, he doesn't do these things on intuitions.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.040]   He doesn't do it on impulses.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.360]   When he slew that Egyptian that was maltreating his fellow countrymen, it wasn't a sudden
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.080]   spasm, as it were.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.240]   This was the end of a long process that had been going on.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.360]   He'd been working it out, and the hour has come to strike.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.560]   He's got to act, but in the light of the process that had been going on.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:05.320]   So the Christian, I say, has a standard by which he can evaluate everything.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   And what is the standard?
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.480]   Well, it's shown here very plainly.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.560]   It is this gospel, it is this message, it is this revelation of God.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.880]   And you see, that enables him to see through the world.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.840]   He's got a test that he can apply to everything, and it comes out like this, "Choosing rather
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:38.880]   to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season."
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   Sin.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:45.920]   In other words, when he looks at all the life of the palace and all the pomp and ceremony
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:52.080]   of a pharaoh, and all that might become so true of him, he doesn't just merely see
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.080]   that.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.340]   That is put immediately into the light and the context of this revelation of God concerning
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.600]   himself and men and life and glory.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.700]   And what had appeared at one time to be so attractive and so wonderful becomes sin.
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:19.840]   It becomes disobedience of God, to live for that, to make that your life, your everything.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.200]   It becomes sinful.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.980]   It's going against this other thing, and your own conscience and everything else within
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.300]   you condemns it.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.280]   So he saw that it was sinful.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.640]   And in the same way, he had the great insight to see that it was only for a season.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.960]   Oh, how easily we could spend our time on this this morning, the pleasures of sin, for
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.120]   a season.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.600]   And they only do last for a season.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.720]   The whole trouble in the world this morning is that men and women don't realize that.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.600]   This isn't life wonderful.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.440]   I'm enjoying it, never had it so good.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.840]   I'm drinking more than ever.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.320]   I'm buying more food than ever.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   I've got a better car than ever.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.200]   Religion, nonsense, rubbish.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.040]   Pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.280]   They don't stop to see that.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   They don't know that.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Why?
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.560]   Well, that's because they're not Christians.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.560]   But the Christian knows.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.080]   He's got this other view.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.320]   He's got this higher understanding.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:26.520]   And he knows that all that is going to vanish, that although he's a pharaoh, he's going
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.560]   to die and crumble into dust in the grave.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.840]   Pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.480]   He sees through it all.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.680]   This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.400]   Very well, he does that.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.560]   But he does another thing.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:52.080]   He's got this understanding, this positive understanding of the Christian life.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.360]   You see, the two things always go together.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.880]   You see through the world, but you also see the other.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.680]   And here, he's able to see exactly the meaning of suffering.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:10.360]   Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, esteeming the reproach
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.520]   of Christ, greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.320]   Now, that's a tremendous statement.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:24.400]   He says, "There is more treasure for me in the reproach of Christ than in all the
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.840]   treasures of Egypt."
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.160]   Now, that means something like this.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.200]   He's able to look upon suffering in this life and in this world in an entirely new
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   manner.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   He says, "If I do this, it will involve me in the reproach and in the suffering which
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.800]   is inherent in the life of these people, but it's all right," he says.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.400]   "I can see that there's value in it."
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.320]   He sees what this man elaborates in the twelfth chapter, where he says, "Whom the Lord
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:02.400]   loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he calleth."
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:08.840]   He can see a healing value in suffering and in trials and in troubles.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.520]   In other words, when troubles and trials come, he doesn't just lie down on the ground and
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.000]   grumble and complain, as the children of Israel so often did.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.320]   No, no, he's got a higher understanding of it all.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.200]   He says, "All this is the result of sin.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   This isn't God, this is the devil.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.960]   This is because men have disobeyed God.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.000]   But God, through it all and beyond it all, has got a great purpose with respect to me.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.120]   He can even use that for my good."
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:40.440]   I have learned in whatsoever state I am therein to be content, says the Apostle Paul, and
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.920]   that Moses had discovered the same secret.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.880]   But listen, there is more.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:54.000]   He says that there is even a privilege in this, "esteeming the reproach of Christ."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.440]   "Greater riches than the treasures in Egypt."
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:04.640]   No, that means this, this term, "the reproach of Christ."
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:12.160]   It means that we are treading in the same steps in which Christ has gone before us.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:18.320]   If ever a man suffered reproach in this world, it was the Son of God when he became man.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.800]   He was despised and rejected of men.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.080]   That's the summing up.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.520]   He suffered reproach and ignominy.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   And the Christian is a man who sees that he is having the great and the high privilege
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.640]   of being like his master.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.200]   So the Apostle Peter makes a great appeal to us when we are in this kind of position.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   He says, "Be like him.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.920]   Walk in his steps."
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.160]   When he was rebelled, rebelled not again.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:56.040]   When he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself unto him.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.320]   And the Apostle Paul puts exactly the same thing.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.240]   He says, "Don't grumble and complain.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.160]   When you find yourself in this trouble, unto you it is given on the behalf of Christ not
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.200]   only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake."
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   It's a high privilege.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:18.560]   "Count it all joy," says James, "my brethren, when ye fall into diverse temptations."
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.600]   So that this man, he says, "I do that.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.720]   I'm not going to be troubled by the reproach.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.520]   I'm walking in the line.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.720]   I'm following him, the reproach of Christ."
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.760]   He regards it as the highest honor.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:39.280]   And so we find that some of the early Christians, when they're finally face to face with martyrdom
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:46.360]   and are being thrown to the lions in the arena, they thank God that at last they've been accounted
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.360]   worthy to suffer shame for his namesake.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.840]   The early Christians used to say this, that the final crown of glory that a Christian
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.560]   was allowed to wear was martyrdom.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.160]   Death for Christ was a crown.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:10.480]   As the athlete is crowned who wins the game, he has the final crown of glory, martyrdom,
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.520]   the reproach of Christ.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.120]   And you see, the other principle is, of course, the recompense of the reward.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.760]   The Christian is able to see that.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:25.080]   And so these are the things that enable him to live this kind of life.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.200]   Now that was exactly what operated in the case of Moses.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720]   We've seen the things that he did.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.200]   Yes, but this is what's important.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   What made him do it?
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.320]   And there's the answer.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.280]   He sees the two ways.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.360]   He sees the glory of this way.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.920]   And so the other becomes simple to him.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   And he does it and he goes forward.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.720]   But I want to put a third principle before you because, as I'm trying to show, it is
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.480]   the most important of all.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.840]   What was it that enabled Moses to do these things?
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.720]   I'm not asking again what made him do them.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.200]   I've told you what made him do them.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.960]   It was the calculating.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.160]   It was the choosing.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.760]   It was the reckoning.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   It was the esteeming.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.120]   Yes, that's the thing that made him do it.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.240]   But what enabled him to do it?
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.920]   It's one thing to see these things theoretically, but here's a man who did them.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.160]   Here's a man who acted on them.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   What's the secret?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.440]   And here is the vital thing.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   The answer is assurance.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.940]   Assurance.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:44.560]   You see, here we see the difference between an intellectual assent to the truth and a
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.240]   living by the truth.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:54.720]   And the only thing that can ever enable a man to live as Moses lived is assurance.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.680]   Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.800]   There was no uncertainty.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   That's why Moses was able to do what he did.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.160]   You don't start then by trying to imitate what Moses did.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.760]   No, no, the thing you must get at is the assurance that Moses had.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.880]   Now then, let's look at that.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.000]   How did he get his assurance?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.440]   Here's the most important question.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.800]   And the records make it fairly plain and clear to us.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.360]   I have no doubt that he got it at the beginning from his own mother.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.840]   You see, his father and mother had faith.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   They're included in the list here.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.920]   By faith, Moses, when he was born, was in three months of his parents.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:44.600]   That's the faith of the parents, because they saw that he was a proper child.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   And they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:34:02.360]   And it seems quite clear that as she brought him up, Amram and Jugahbed brought him up,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:09.160]   they told him who he was and why they'd acted as they'd done.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.200]   They told him this great thing that was the secret of the children of Israel.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   They're slaves at the moment in Egypt, it doesn't matter.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.920]   They know this story.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.400]   Every Israelite was taught it, and they knew it, and she taught him.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.600]   He was brought up in it, so he knew.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.560]   Though he was called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, he knew this other thing.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.720]   It was always with him, as I say.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.520]   I don't know, but it's not difficult to speculate that there was something beyond
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:40.880]   that, that God was speaking to him and God was dealing with him over and above this when
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.480]   he began to grow and became a young man.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.920]   And God began to deal with him in a more direct manner.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.480]   We're not told that, but it's inevitable, it seems to me, from the whole teaching of
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   the Bible.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.920]   But let me come to something about which we are absolutely certain.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   The burning bush.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:07.480]   There he is one afternoon, just taking the sheep round to the other side of the mountain,
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.520]   the back side of the mountain, as it's called.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.840]   He'd done this many times before.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.200]   He wasn't expecting anything.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.480]   He'd settled down into this life of a simple shepherd.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:25.000]   Suddenly, he beheld this bush that is burning and which nevertheless is not consumed.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.400]   And he was on the point of examining this great mystery when the voice came to him out
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.280]   of the burning bush, the voice of God.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.680]   And God spoke to him.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.300]   And he knew it was God.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.960]   This is assurance.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.720]   This is not believing theoretically in God somewhere in the heavens.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.720]   It's God addressing him.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.160]   "Take off the shoes from off thy feet.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.080]   Stand back."
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.840]   In the presence of God and hearing the voice of God.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.080]   That gives assurance.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.240]   That gives certainty.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.680]   There's immediacy there.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.640]   That's not deducing things from Scripture.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   He hadn't got any.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.720]   There were no Scriptures.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.480]   God dealing with him, speaking to him directly, manifesting himself, and then proceeding to
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.400]   give him the covenant, telling him what he proposes to do.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.760]   And of course, as you read the story, you will find that there are many other occasions
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.520]   when God met him and spoke to him.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:22.480]   It was to him in particular that God gave this great name Jehovah.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.200]   I am that I am.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.680]   He hadn't given it in that specific manner before.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.920]   He'd used it.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.760]   But it was through Moses that he gave this great covenant name of himself to the children
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.160]   of Israel.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   And he stated the terms of the covenant and opened before them what he was going to do.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   This gives assurance.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:50.000]   Now you see, it's only as you understand this that you see how Moses was able to do what
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   he did.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.360]   How easy it is for us to read the story of Moses going into the presence of Pharaoh.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.760]   And of course, we all tend to think we do the same thing.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.840]   You try to imagine it, my friend.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.560]   You try to imagine yourself standing up in utter helplessness with just a crowd of helpless,
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.720]   hopeless people behind you and defying the might of a Pharaoh and leading out the people.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.280]   Imagine yourself with Peah-heroth and Beelzephon and the hosts of Pharaoh and the Red Sea.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.640]   How easy it is to read these things, but can you see yourself doing them?
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.480]   What enables a man to do things like that?
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.520]   There's only one answer.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.840]   It is absolute assurance.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.760]   And God had given him the assurance in these ways.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.400]   And then he'd given him miraculous powers.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.320]   He'd enabled him to do things that are supernatural.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.080]   And it is in the light of these that Moses obtained his assurance.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.040]   But let me ask a second question.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.480]   What was he sure of?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   Because these are the things of which we must be sure.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.300]   We must have assurance of our position.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:01.240]   We must know that we are the children of God with an absolute certainty.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.240]   What are we to be sure of?
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.120]   Well, here are some of them.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.680]   He was sure of God's purpose and plan of salvation.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   He was sure of this message that God was preparing a people for himself out of the world.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.320]   He had inherited this tradition.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.920]   His mother had taught it him, I say, of Abel and Cain, the division.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.440]   God's men, the world's men.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:34.200]   This line that runs right down, Noah and his family, people of God, the start of the new
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.800]   race as it were.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.360]   And so he believed all this.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.920]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, people of God being prepared, God's way of salvation.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.520]   He believes this.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.400]   He's sure of this.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.440]   He doesn't take the world as it is.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.680]   He says, yes, I know, I see everything as everybody else sees it.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.720]   But I know that God has a plan and a purpose.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.800]   He's calling out a people for himself.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.480]   He's preparing for a kingdom.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.580]   He's going on with this in spite of what I see.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580]   He believed that.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.760]   He was sure of that.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:13.600]   And you notice that the word Christ is used here, the reproach of Christ.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.800]   You say, how can that be used about Moses who lived so long before Christ, 1400 years
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.080]   before Christ?
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.320]   Why does it say reproach of Christ?
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:28.120]   The answer is quite plain in the scriptures.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.040]   We saw in the case of Abraham that he had seen the day of Christ, and the same is true
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.120]   of Moses.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:42.360]   God had given a revelation to Moses concerning the coming of his son as a deliverer.
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.800]   He hadn't seen it plainly.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.080]   He'd seen it afar off, but he'd seen it.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.040]   Listen, this is what Moses said towards the end of his life to the people.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.680]   He said, "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.440]   unto me.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.120]   Him shall ye hear."
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.160]   And Stephen, when he's on trial, quotes that.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.760]   He says, "That's the prophecy that Moses gave concerning the coming of the Christ,
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.520]   the Son of God, whom I'm preaching to you."
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.360]   Moses saw the coming of the day of Christ.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.760]   There's no question about it.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:24.680]   You'll find that in Deuteronomy 18, verses 15 to 19, that which was quoted by Stephen.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.640]   He knew that he was suffering the reproach of the Christ of God that was to come.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:36.160]   And so we are told that by faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.700]   Now that's not merely something mechanical.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.360]   He did what he was told to do, yes, but he saw the ultimate meaning.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.880]   Not plainly, but he saw it.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   He says it's blood.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.920]   God always delivers by blood.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.040]   Abel had seen that when he offered a blood sacrifice, not the fruit of the ground.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.520]   They've all seen this.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.800]   Moses sees it particularly clearly.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.420]   It is by blood.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.240]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:04.720]   He was the man who was given all the detailed instruction about the shedding of blood and
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.080]   the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:13.960]   The Passover, the blood that covers, the blood that saves, the blood that redeems.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.320]   He was certain of this.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.840]   He didn't believe it vaguely.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.920]   He knew that it was only in Christ that he and all others could be saved and that his
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.720]   blood was going to be shed.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:30.560]   The Paschal Lamb is the foreshadowing of the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.880]   world.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.700]   He was certain of this.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.000]   He wasn't trying to justify himself by works.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.880]   That's this man's whole point.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.160]   He wasn't saying if I live a good life I'll please God.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160]   No, no.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.920]   He was saying if I live a good life I'll please God.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.680]   And he was absolutely sure of it.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.720]   But let me go on.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.640]   He was equally sure that the children of Israel were God's people and that he was one of
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   them.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:42:01.280]   There it's at the back of the great decision, you see, not to be called any longer the son
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   There when he sees the Egyptian and the Jew and the Egyptian tyrant maltreating the Jew,
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.000]   the great moment arrives.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   And he doesn't hesitate.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.360]   He says these are the people I belong to.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.280]   This is one of God's people?
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.280]   That's a pagan.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.400]   That's not one of God's people.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.800]   I'm regarded as one who belongs to this, but I don't.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   I belong to that.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.080]   I'm going to show it.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.960]   And he gives himself.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.040]   No longer the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:37.800]   It's because he believes and knows and is sure that the children of Israel, though they're
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.320]   not his children, are nevertheless the people of God and that he is one of them.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.920]   He's a child of God.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.120]   He also was certain that he was called to fulfill a special function with respect to
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:56.200]   them.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.800]   Thank God we are told in the records that he hesitated and faltered a little bit now
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   and again.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.200]   You see, we are not perfect in this life, but of this he was certain that God was calling
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   him.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   "I can't speak.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   How are you calling me?
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   I've got no power.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   How can I do it?"
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   "It's all right," says God.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   "I'll be with you.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   Go on."
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   And on he went.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.880]   He was certain that God had called him to go back and to lead the people out of the
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.240]   captivity into the freedom and the enjoyment of the land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.360]   It's a great thing when a man knows that he's called to fulfill a special function in the
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.280]   kingdom of God, and Moses knew it.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:40.160]   In spite of his own modesty and meekness and hesitation, he knew that God had called him
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.620]   and on he goes.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:44.600]   He was certain of this.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:50.280]   And then, of course, he is certain of the ultimate destiny of all God's people, the
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:56.340]   recompense of the reward, "Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:01.800]   in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward."
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.880]   That's heaven, my friends.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.920]   And you see, the men whom God can use and the men who are able to do these exploits
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.040]   in this world are the men who are certain of heaven.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   They know where they're going.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.500]   Therefore, they're not afraid of tyrants, pharaohs, and all the host of the world.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:27.880]   They know that there remaineth a rest for the people of God, the recompense of the reward,
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:33.040]   not an earthly canaan that's included, but a heavenly canaan beyond it, the city which
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.480]   has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:46.600]   But the last thing, and the most wonderful thing of all, is this.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   Why?
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   What was the secret?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:07.260]   "For he endured," he kept on, "as seeing him who is invisible."
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:11.980]   He was certain of God.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.980]   He knew God.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:22.600]   He knew the character of God, that God is truth, God is holy, God is omnipotent, that
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.160]   his promises are ever sure.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:33.480]   No man hath seen God at any time, but Moses knew him.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   Not only the theophany is the burning bush, he had met him, he had spoken to him, he had
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.120]   access into his holy presence.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:53.040]   One of the greatest chapters in the Old Testament is Exodus 33, where you find Moses praying
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.960]   to God and pleading with him.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.680]   "Go up," says God, "I'll send an angel to lead your people into Canaan."
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.880]   "Now, now," says Moses, "we won't go unless you come with us."
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.920]   "But I'm going to send an angel and I'll give you power."
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.840]   "Now," says Moses, "except you come with us, we shall not go up either.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.920]   Don't send us up unless you come with us."
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.000]   And so he pleads with God.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.800]   He's a man who knows God.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.960]   He knows the way to enter into the presence of God.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.680]   And he asks God to reveal his glory to him.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.600]   That's his greatest concern.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.880]   He doesn't merely want to go into Canaan.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.800]   He wants to be with God.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.420]   This is the thing to him.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:39.320]   Not the mere possession of a land, but God with us, and God amongst us, and God blessing
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   us.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:46.760]   And so he endured a seeing him who is invisible.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:52.360]   And so, you see, when he finds himself there confronted by the Red Sea and the miserable
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.800]   children of Israel said, "Have you brought us up to slaughter us at this point?
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.800]   Why did you ever bring us up?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   Why don't you take us back?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   Here it is.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   What can be done?"
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:05.560]   Moses went and fell on his face before God.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.520]   He always knew the way was open.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.840]   He always knew that God was ready to receive him.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.480]   He endured a seeing him that is invisible.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.280]   This is the whole secret of the Christian life.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.360]   To know God, my friends.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.640]   Not merely to believe about God, but to know him.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.060]   This is the thing.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.160]   And here is the whole argument of this man.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.600]   These men, he says, belong to the old dispensation.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:39.200]   They all were unable to do the things they did because they knew God.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.480]   They hadn't received the promises, but they only saw them afar off.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.840]   The argument is, my dear friends, that if it is possible for an Old Testament saint
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:55.240]   to have this degree of assurance, how much greater is it now?
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:01.720]   This man contrasts and compares the old dispensation and the new in chapter 8 and in chapter 12
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.100]   of this great epistle.
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.040]   And all along he is proving this, the superiority of the new.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:12.000]   Because the Son of God has now come and the death has taken place, how much greater, he
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.920]   says, is our position?
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.840]   Be careful, my dear friend, lest you put the saints of the Old Testament in a higher position
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.160]   than you put the saints of the New Testament.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.800]   You say, if God appeared to me in a burning bush, well then, of course, I'd be able to
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:39.520]   act as Moses did, if only I had this external assurance that was given to him.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:46.000]   But that's a very wrong and a very unscriptural argument.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.720]   What is offered in the New Testament is very much higher than that which is offered in
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.800]   the Old Testament.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:49:00.040]   And the assurance that you and I should enjoy in Christ, and as a result of the outpouring
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:06.200]   of the Spirit of God on the day of Pentecost, the baptism of the Spirit, should put us in
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.960]   an infinitely higher position.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:14.320]   And when you look at these men, great as they are, and put them by the side of a man like
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:20.680]   the Apostle Paul, I say, they appear as small men.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.160]   Why, well, the Apostle is able to look back on Calvary.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.520]   He is in Christ, he has been baptized by the Spirit.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.160]   I know whom I have believed.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.080]   It's not a vague, uncertain faith, it's not a hoping against hope, it's not a trying to
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.800]   hold on as best you can.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.760]   No, no, I know him in whom I have believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.440]   which I have committed unto him against that day.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.080]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:50:00.280]   I know, I am certain, I am persuaded, to me to live is Christ, to die is gain.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.800]   He has absolute certainty.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.520]   God dealing familiarly with men.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.600]   My dear friends, I leave you with this question.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.880]   Are you living a life as seeing him who is invisible?
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.280]   Is God real to you?
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.720]   Is the Lord Jesus Christ real to you?
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.900]   That is the New Testament teaching.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.720]   We are meant to know God.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.160]   We are meant to know that we are the children of God.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.280]   We don't just take it by faith and not worry about our feelings and say, "No, of course,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.600]   I take it in the Word, that's all the Word."
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.680]   This separation of the Word and the Spirit is very near to blasphemy.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:50.720]   The Spirit upon the Word is meant to give us an absolute assurance to know God, to know
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:57.240]   yourself in the presence of God, to have access to God beyond any doubt or uncertainty or
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.280]   any question.
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:09.160]   He endured as seeing him who is invisible.
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.400]   He walked with God.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.800]   Are you walking with God, my friends?
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.680]   That's the thing to seek.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   We have no right to rest on any position which is less than a full assurance of faith, a
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:30.800]   full assurance of knowledge, and a full assurance of hope.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:39.320]   And as we have this glorious certainty, whatever we may be called upon the face or to do, we
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   shall be enabled to do so in precisely the same way as Moses did in his day and generation.
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:59.480]   Give yourselves no rest until you see him who is invisible and know that God is your
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:10.360]   God and that you are his child destined to receive the recompense of the reward.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.440]   Amen.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
