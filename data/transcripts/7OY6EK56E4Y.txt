[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   For the first time ever in the United States, unmarried women outnumber married women.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.080]   And when I read the literature on this phenomenon, Pastor John, what is often applauded is the
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.160]   liberation of women who have escaped the cultural norms of the shackles of marriage and expectations
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.120]   of children in order to be free from these so-called oppressions.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.360]   That's putting it rather bluntly, but that's the tenor of the literature.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.400]   There are other factors here, of course, including male immaturity.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.120]   For now, the freedom language is very thick.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.960]   That's what I want to address here today in this episode, because the more books I read,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.160]   the more I sincerely don't think that modern day feminists know that 1 Corinthians 7 exists
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.540]   and that the Bible commends lifelong singleness on purpose, for a purpose, of course.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.660]   But many feminists seem to assume that the default position of the Bible and the Church
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.840]   is that all women are to find meaning and purpose in marriage, and that's simply not
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.320]   exclusively true.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.360]   So how would you explain 1 Corinthians 7 and Paul's words to unmarried women to the women's
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.400]   liberation movement today?
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.120]   Well, I don't know if this is going to get at it exactly the way you would get at it.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.160]   You should probably do this podcast, because you've clearly thought a lot about this, so
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   that's great.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.720]   But I sat here and I thought, "Let me come at 1 Corinthians 7 in a roundabout way, and
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   I think if I do it this way, it might open up people to some unexpected things in the
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.400]   chapter that they're not as familiar with."
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.820]   It seems to me that we are trying to avoid a misunderstanding on two fronts.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.380]   On one front is the misunderstanding of marriage as bondage and oppression, and on the other
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.940]   front is the misunderstanding of singleness as liberation and freedom.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:15.240]   But the reality is that pursuing the unfettered autonomy of singleness may be a deeper bondage,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.780]   and embracing the sorrows of a disappointing marriage may be a more profound freedom.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.000]   Now, of course, that way of talking, that way of seeing the world makes no sense to
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.160]   those who define freedom as doing whatever you feel like doing when you feel like doing
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.160]   it.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.380]   But thoughtful people don't define freedom or liberation that way.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.100]   That kind of freedom will get children killed by running out in the street or putting their
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.860]   finger in an electric socket because they feel like it right now.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.580]   It doesn't matter what anybody else says.
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.800]   That kind of freedom leads to thousands of free people being in the state penitentiary.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.420]   It leads to thousands more being in bondage to venereal disease and thousands more leaving
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.940]   a carnage of broken relationships behind them.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.220]   Doing what you feel like doing when you feel like doing it has never proved to be a life
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.680]   of liberation, but only bondage.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.460]   True freedom isn't just doing what you want to do, period.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.820]   It's doing what you want to do and wanting what you ought to do.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.760]   In other words, there's something crucial that defines freedom underneath "want to"
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.900]   and "feel like," namely "ought to" and "the person you were meant to be."
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.860]   And of course, as soon as you bring an "ought to" onto the table or a "person you were
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:15.260]   made to be," we're confronted immediately with a higher or deeper authority than ourselves,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.700]   namely God.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:28.220]   There can be no true freedom when a person tries to ignore God's design for their life,
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.520]   just like there's no true freedom if you try to ignore the law of gravity.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:41.180]   If you jump off a cliff, you may feel the exhilaration of freedom for three or four
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.980]   seconds, then you die.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.500]   And living your life without reference to God is like jumping off a cliff.
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.940]   It just takes a little longer to hit bottom, but you will.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.700]   So now we come to 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   Yes, it does have to do with 1 Corinthians 7, where Paul deals with two issues.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:13.220]   One is marriage and singleness, and the other is slaves who get converted to Jesus, and
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.280]   the question is whether they should stay in their present condition or not.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.940]   And it's very interesting to me that those two issues happen to land interwoven in the
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.300]   same chapter.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.580]   So he says to slaves—this is going to be relevant for marriage and singleness—he
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.140]   says to slaves, "Were you a slave when called," that is, called to be a Christian, "do not
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.780]   be concerned about it," and then Parentis says, "but if you can, get your freedom,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   avail yourself of it, for the reason you shouldn't be too concerned about spending your life,
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.700]   even if you have to, in the present difficult situation, for he who is called in the Lord
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.300]   is a slave, as a slave, is a freedman of the Lord.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.060]   Likewise, he who was free when he was called," namely to be a Christian, "is a slave of
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.700]   Christ.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.900]   You were bought with a price," that is, the blood of Jesus, "so do not become slaves
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.900]   of men."
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.980]   Now, there's the key to the Christian life and to all of our relationships, including
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.620]   singleness and marriage.
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:35.420]   What makes for true freedom is belonging to Jesus, who bought us with his blood, who owns
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:42.560]   us by purchase, who loves us, who designs the best life for us, the most beautiful life
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.420]   for us, and who will bring us to everlasting and deepest possible joy.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:58.420]   That is freedom, which means that if we are in a painful relationship, like slavery or
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:08.020]   a deeply disappointing marriage, and we are there with Jesus, belonging to Jesus, owned
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:15.020]   by Jesus, loved by Jesus, getting help from Jesus, experiencing his fellowship, enjoying
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:22.900]   his guidance, following his will, we are walking in great freedom.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.260]   That's why I said at the beginning, there may be more freedom by embracing a painful
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.420]   relationship than in embracing unfettered autonomy.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:40.720]   It also means that if we are free from all human commitments and restraints and living
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.780]   a life of unfettered autonomy, not submitting to Jesus, not enjoying his fellowship, we
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:57.460]   are in the profoundest bondage to sin and selfishness, and we will hit the bottom of
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.000]   the cliff sooner or later.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.740]   So this is the principle that Paul applies in 1 Corinthians 7 to marriage and singleness.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.220]   He loves his singleness.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:17.300]   He wishes others could have this particular life of Christian freedom.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.060]   This is what you were talking about at the beginning, Tony, when you said people don't
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.260]   even know that this is in the Bible, that the exaltation of a life of devoted singleness
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.700]   is there, rather than idealizing marriage as the only way to live.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.500]   Amazingly, he says, 1 Corinthians 7, 7, "I wish that all of you were as I myself am."
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.420]   Well, you crazy?
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.840]   There wouldn't be any babies if we were all single.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:53.440]   But he says it, "But each has his own gift from God, one kind or another.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.940]   To the unmarried and the widows I say, it is good for them to remain single as I am."
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:08.900]   And then he adds, lest we draw the wrong inference, he's not telling anyone, he says, not to marry.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.660]   So verse 36, it's amazing how he starts and ends with this kind of thing.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:21.520]   If anyone thinks that he's not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.860]   strong and it has to be, let him do as he wishes, let him marry.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.700]   It is no sin.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.440]   So he's not condemning marriage.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.620]   He's just exalting in his singleness and wishing others could join him in it.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.980]   Well, here's the question, what makes his singleness so great in his mind?
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.900]   What should make it great in our minds?
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:57.820]   It's because singleness offered him a unique experience of devotion to the Lord.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:04.640]   He said, "I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.840]   promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord."
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.340]   There's the bottom line of freedom, devotion to the Lord, belonging to the Lord, living
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:23.260]   in joyful submission to the Lord who loved us and gave himself for us.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:29.820]   So when Paul says that marrying is no sin and singleness provides undivided devotion
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:37.460]   to the Lord, he's not saying that marriage means you don't walk as closely with the
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:47.100]   Lord or depend as deeply on the Lord or enjoy the Lord with less sweetness of fellowship.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:55.260]   He means the challenges in both states, marriage and singleness, the challenges in both states
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.180]   are different, very different.
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.540]   There are unique distractions in marriage.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.260]   That's what he's drawing attention to in particular.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:11.780]   There are unique distractions in marriage that we must guard against lest our hearts
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.700]   be divided and the Lord take second place.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.260]   But I think if we pushed on Paul, he would say there are other kinds of distractions
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.640]   for single people that require similar vigilance.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.220]   So the point is Christian freedom, whether in lifelong commitment to marriage or in a
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:39.500]   lifelong state of singleness, means belonging utterly to the risen Lord Jesus, trusting
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.620]   him completely with our lives, submitting all our decisions to his will, enjoying all
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:52.640]   his fellowship, expecting all his promises of help, and finding ourselves wonderfully
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.560]   useful in our marriage or in our singleness in serving other people.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:05.380]   So yes, Tony, I do encourage people to go deep into 1 Corinthians 7.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:12.100]   I think there are profound things there about marriage, about singleness, because there
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:18.220]   are profound things there about the Lordship of Christ and what it means to be totally
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.420]   his and totally free.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   Amen.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.820]   Thank you for addressing this crucial chapter, especially as younger Christians face these
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.380]   new cultural temptations.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.820]   It's good to see the depth of scripture in this profound chapter on self-giving.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.580]   And I mean, that's what I was looking for, whether by marriage or by singleness, true
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.260]   freedom is self-giving.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.860]   Well, we're going to break for the weekend now, and you can look back on the episodes
