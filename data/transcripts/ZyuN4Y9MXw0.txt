[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   And you see, string theory is a multiverse theory.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.400]   So people say, first of all, what is string theory?
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.040]   String theory simply says that all the particles we see in nature, the electron, the proton,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.640]   the quarks, what have you, are nothing but vibrations on a musical string, on a tiny,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   tiny little string.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.760]   You know, G. Robert Oppenheimer, the creator of the atomic bomb, was so frustrated in the
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.120]   1950s with all these subatomic particles being created in our atom smashers that he announced,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   he announced one day that the Nobel Prize in physics should go to the physicist who
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.160]   does not discover a new particle that year.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   Well today we think they're nothing but musical notes on these tiny little vibrating strings.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880]   So what is physics?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.560]   Physics is the harmonies you can write on vibrating strings.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.400]   What is chemistry?
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.840]   Chemistry is the melodies you can play on these strings.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.920]   What is the universe?
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.340]   The universe is a symphony of strings.
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.640]   And then what is the mind of God that Albert Einstein so eloquently wrote about for the
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.240]   last 30 years of his life?
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.680]   The mind of God would be cosmic music resonating through 11-dimensional hyperspace.
