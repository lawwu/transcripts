[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey,
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.640]   a two-time Oscar-winning actor who has starred
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.000]   in "Seven," "The Usual Suspects," "American Beauty,"
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.160]   and "House of Cards."
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.360]   He is one of the greatest actors ever,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640]   creating haunting performances of characters
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   who often embody the dark side of human nature.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480]   Seven years ago, he was cut from "House of Cards"
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.760]   and canceled by "Hollywood and the World"
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.240]   when Anthony Rapp made an allegation
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.480]   that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.960]   Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.800]   seeking $40 million.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.840]   In this trial and all civil and criminal trials that followed,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.120]   Kevin was acquitted.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.160]   He has never been found guilty nor liable in a court of law.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.800]   In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.880]   and what he didn't do.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.120]   I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.200]   and Alison Pearson interviews for additional details
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.240]   and responses to the allegations.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.280]   As an aside, let me say that one of the principles
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.320]   I operate under for this podcast and in life
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280]   is that I will talk with everyone,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.360]   with empathy and with backbone.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.560]   For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.200]   life's story, and what and how they think,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.800]   and do so honestly and fully.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.840]   The brilliance and the flaws.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.000]   I won't whitewash their sins,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.160]   but I won't reduce them to a worst possible caricature
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.080]   of their sins either.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.680]   The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.240]   too often does,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.120]   often rushing to a final judgment before the facts are in.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.080]   I will try to do better than that,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.440]   to respect due process, in service of the truth.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.400]   And I hope to have the courage to always think independently
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.720]   and to speak honestly from the heart,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.920]   even when the eyes of the outrage mob are on me.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.000]   Again, my goal is to understand human beings
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   at their best and at their worst.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.440]   And hope is such understanding leads to more compassion
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   and wisdom in the world.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   I will make mistakes.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.200]   And when I do, I will work hard to improve.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.280]   I love you all.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.920]   in the description.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.520]   And now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.280]   You played a serial killer in the movie "Seven."
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.080]   Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.160]   of a murderer on screen ever.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.560]   What was your process of becoming him,
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   John Doe, the serial killer?
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.160]   - The truth is I didn't get the part.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.880]   I had been in Los Angeles making a couple of films,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.320]   "Swimming with Sharks" and "Usual Suspects."
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.320]   And then I did a film called "Outbreak"
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.840]   that Morgan Freeman was in.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.320]   And I went in to audition for David Fincher
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   in probably late November of '94.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.040]   And I auditioned for this part and didn't get it.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   And I went back to New York.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   And I think they started shooting like December 12th.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840]   And I'm in New York.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.760]   I'm back in my wonderful apartment on West 12th Street.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.480]   And my mom has come to visit for Christmas.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.240]   And it's December 23rd.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.840]   And it's like seven o'clock at night and my phone rings.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.720]   And it's Arnold Copelson, who's the producer of "Seven."
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.600]   And he's very jovial and he's very friendly.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.800]   And he says, "How you doing?"
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   And I said, "Fine."
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.200]   And he said, "Listen, do you remember that film
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.520]   "you came in for, 'Seven'?"
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.960]   I said, "Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.280]   He goes, "Well, turns out that we hired an actor
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   "and we started shooting.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.520]   "And then yesterday, David fired him.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   "And David would like you to get on a plane on Sunday
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   "and come to Los Angeles and start shooting on Tuesday."
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.200]   And I was like, "Okay, would it be imposing to say,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.280]   "can I read it again?
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.400]   "'Cause it's been a while now and I'd like to..."
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.600]   So they sent a script over.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   I read the script that night.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.120]   I thought about it.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   And I had this feeling, I can't even quite describe it,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.720]   but I had this feeling that it would be really good
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.280]   if I didn't take billing in the film.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.560]   And the reason I felt that was because I knew
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.600]   that by the time this film would come out,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   it would be the last one of the three movies
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.240]   that I just shot, the fourth one.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.480]   And if any of those films broke through or did well,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   if it was gonna be Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.640]   Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey,
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.800]   and you don't show up for the first 25, 30, 40 minutes,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.760]   people are gonna figure out who you're playing.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.480]   - So people should know that you are the serial,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.760]   you play the serial killer in the movie
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.560]   and the serial killer shows up more than halfway
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.040]   through the movie. - Very late in the movie.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.560]   - And when you say billing, it's like the posters,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   the VHS cover, everything, you're gone, you're not there.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.400]   - Not there.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   And so New Line Cinema told me to go fuck myself,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.160]   that they absolutely could use my picture and my image.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.120]   And this became a little bit of a,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.960]   I'd say 24-hour conversation.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.760]   And it was Fincher who said,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.600]   "I actually think this is a really cool idea."
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.200]   So the compromise was I'm the first credit
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.680]   at the end of the movie when the credits start.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.320]   So I got on a plane on that Sunday
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.800]   where they were shooting and I went into the makeup room
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.640]   and David Fincher was there and we were talking about
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.680]   what should I do, how should I look?
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.400]   And I just had my hair short for "Outbreak"
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.200]   'cause I was playing a military character.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.720]   And I just looked at the hairdresser and I said,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.000]   "Do you have a razor?"
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.440]   And Fincher went, "Are you kidding?"
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.040]   And I said, "No."
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   He goes, "If you shave your head, I'll shave mine."
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.760]   So we both shaved our heads.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.180]   And then I started shooting the next day.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.960]   - So my long-winded answer to your question
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   is that I didn't have that much time
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   to think about how to build that character.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.120]   What I think in the end Fincher was able
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.760]   to do so brilliantly with such terror
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.840]   was to set the audience up to meet this character.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.580]   I think the last scene, the ending scene
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.820]   and the car ride leading up to it,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.160]   where it's mostly on you in conversation
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.960]   with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.500]   is one of the greatest scenes in film history.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.820]   So if people somehow didn't see the movie,
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.660]   there's these five murders that happen
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.140]   that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.980]   and the ending scene is inspired,
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.580]   represents the last two deadly sins.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.540]   And there's this calm subtlety about you
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.940]   in your performance that's just terrifying.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.580]   Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.220]   that's also really strong, but that is a contrast.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.060]   In the contrast is the terrifying sense
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.320]   that you get in the audience that builds up
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.220]   to the twist at the end or the surprise at the end
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.420]   with the famous what's in the box from Brad Pitt.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   That is Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.900]   - Yeah, I can really only tell you
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.380]   that while we were shooting that scene in the car,
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.860]   while we were out in the desert
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.740]   in that place where all those electrical wires were,
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.240]   David just kept saying, "Less, do less."
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.460]   And I just tried to, I remember he kept saying to me,
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.100]   "Remember, you're in control.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.200]   "Like you're going to win.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.320]   "And knowing that should allow you
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.740]   "to have tremendous confidence."
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.620]   And I just followed that lead.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.580]   And I just think it's the kind of film
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   that so many of the elements that had been at work
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.240]   from the beginning of the movie in terms of its style,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.220]   in terms of how he built this terror,
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.980]   in terms of how he built for the audience
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.540]   a sense of this person being one of the scariest people
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.280]   they might ever encounter.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.920]   It really allowed me to be able to not have to do that much,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.600]   just say the words and mean them.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.580]   And I think it also is,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.380]   it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult.
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:17.660]   Very often tragedy is people operating
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.880]   without enough information.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.460]   They don't have all the facts.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.940]   Romeo and Juliet, they don't have all the facts.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.980]   They don't know what we know as an audience.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.020]   And so in the end,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:36.820]   whether Brad Pitt's character ends up shooting John Doe
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:42.580]   or turning the gun on himself, which was a discussion.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.460]   I mean, there were a number of alternative endings
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.220]   that were discussed.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:52.840]   Nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.700]   It is complicated and shows
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.500]   how nobody wins in the end
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.920]   when you're not operating with all the information.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.540]   - When you say say the words and mean them,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.300]   what does mean them mean?
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:18.620]   - I've been very fortunate to be directed
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.880]   by Fincher a couple of times.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.160]   And he would say to me sometimes,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.220]   "I don't believe a thing that is coming out of your mouth.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.740]   "Shall we try it again?"
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:42.220]   And you go, "Okay, yeah, we can try it again."
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.660]   And sometimes he'll do take
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   and then you'll look to see if he has any
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.100]   added genius to hand you.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.900]   And he just goes, "Let's do it again.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.460]   "And then let's do it again."
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.460]   And sometimes, I say this in all humility,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.760]   he's literally trying to beat the acting out of you.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.620]   And by continually saying, "Do it again, do it again,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.140]   "do it again," and not giving you any specifics,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   he is systematically shredding you of all pretense.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.260]   'Cause look, very often actors,
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.140]   we come in on the set and we've thought about the scene
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.980]   and we've worked out, "I've got this prop
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.060]   "and I'm gonna do this thing with a can.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.360]   "All these things, all the tea,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.260]   "I'm gonna do a thing with the thing."
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.100]   And David is the kind of director
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.780]   where he just wants you to stop adding all that crap
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.780]   and just say the words and say them quickly and mean them.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.620]   And it takes a while to get to that place.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.540]   I'll tell you a story, this is a story I just love
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.940]   because it's in exactly the same wheelhouse.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.180]   So Jack Lemmon's first movie was a film
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.140]   called "It Should Happen to You"
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.860]   and it was directed by George Cukor.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.660]   And Jack tells this story
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.780]   and it was just an incredibly charming story
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.740]   to hear Jack tell.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.600]   He said, "So I'm doing this picture
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.680]   "and let me tell you, this is a terrific part for me.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.460]   "And I'm doing a scene, it's on my first day.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.740]   "It's my first day and it's a terrific scene."
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.500]   And he goes, "We do the first take."
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.840]   And George Cukor comes up to me and he says,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.780]   "Jack," I said, "Yeah."
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.740]   He said, "Could you do, let's do another one,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.180]   "but just do a little less in this one."
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.780]   And Jack said, "A little less,
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:34.940]   "a little less than what I just did?"
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.220]   He said, "Yeah, just a little less."
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.820]   So he goes, "We do another take."
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.320]   And I think, "Boy, that was it.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.140]   "I mean, let's just go home."
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.940]   And Cukor walked up to him and he said,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.200]   "Jack, I'd like to do another one,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.860]   "this time just a little bit less."
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.100]   And Jack said, "Less than what I just did now?"
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.460]   He said, "Yeah, just a little bit less."
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.420]   He goes, "Oh, okay."
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.440]   So they did another take and Cukor came up and he said,
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.140]   "Jack, just a little bit less."
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.060]   And Jack said, "A little less than what I just did?"
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.880]   He said, "Yes."
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.860]   He goes, "Well, if I do any less,
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.540]   "I'm not gonna be acting."
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.860]   And Cukor said, "Exactly, Jack, exactly."
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.900]   - I mean, I guess what you're saying
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.540]   is it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.980]   of a little less, because the power,
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.940]   if we just stick even on seven,
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.180]   of your performance is in the tiniest of subtleties.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.780]   Like when you say, "Oh, you didn't know,"
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.820]   and you turn your head a little bit,
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.900]   and a little bit like the little bit,
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.340]   maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.920]   That's subtlety, that's less.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.100]   That's hard to get to, I suppose.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.640]   - Yeah, and also because I so well remember,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.060]   I think the work that Brad did,
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.720]   and also Morgan did in that scene,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.940]   but the work that Brad had to do, where he had to go.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.260]   I remember rehearsing with him
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.540]   as we were all staying at this little hotel
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.660]   nearby that location, and we rehearsed the night
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.500]   before we started shooting that sequence.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.380]   And I just, I mean, it was just incredible
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.380]   to see the levels of emotions he had to go through,
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.020]   and then the decision of, "What do I do?
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.760]   "Because if I do what he wants me to do, then he wins.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.460]   "But if I don't do it, then I'm,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.420]   "what kind of a man, husband am I?"
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.900]   I just thought he did really incredible work.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.180]   So it was also not easy to not react
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.180]   to the power of what he was throwing at me.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.140]   I just thought it was an extraordinary,
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.500]   a really extraordinary scene.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.080]   - So what's it like being in that scene?
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.260]   So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.860]   and Brad Pitt is going over the top,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.540]   just having a mental breakdown,
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices,
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.380]   as you're saying.
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.960]   But he's screaming and in pain and tormented
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.620]   while you're very subtly smiling.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.940]   - In terms of the writing and in terms of what
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.300]   the characters had to do, it was an incredible culmination
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.340]   of how this character
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.700]   could manipulate in the way that he did,
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:21.040]   and in the end, succeed.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.580]   - You mentioned Fincher likes to do a lot of takes.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.740]   That's the famous thing about David Fincher.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.900]   So what are the pros and cons of that?
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.180]   - I think I read that he does some crazy amount.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.860]   He averages 25 to 65 takes,
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.100]   and most directors do less than 10.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.820]   - Yeah, sometimes it's timing.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.420]   Sometimes it's literally he has a stopwatch
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.060]   and he's timing how long a scene is taking.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.400]   And then he'll say,
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.620]   "You need to take a minute off this scene."
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.380]   - Like a minute?
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.220]   - Yeah, a minute off the scene.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.420]   I want it to move like this.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.420]   So let's pick it up.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.540]   Let's pick up the pace.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.940]   Let's see if we can take a minute off.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.980]   - Why the speed?
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.780]   Why say fast is the important thing for him, you think?
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.120]   - I think because Fincher hates indulgence.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.060]   And he wants people to talk the way they do in life,
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.620]   which is we don't take big dramatic pauses
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.020]   before we speak.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.860]   We speak.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.700]   We say what we want.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.620]   - And I guess actors like the dramatic pauses
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.460]   and the indulge in the dramatic pauses.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.500]   - Well, they didn't always like the dramatic pauses.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.100]   I mean, look, you go back, any student of acting,
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.440]   you go back to the '30s and the '40s, '50s,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.540]   the speed at which actors spoke,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.900]   not just in the comedies, which of course,
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.540]   you look at any Preston Sturges movie
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.540]   and it's incredible how fast people are talking
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.540]   and how funny things are when they happen that fast.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.380]   But then, acting styles changed.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.540]   We got into a different kind of thing
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.780]   in the late '50s and '60s.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:21.500]   And a lot of actors are feeling it,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.220]   which is, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:30.220]   It's just that if you want to keep an audience engaged,
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.780]   as Fincher does, and I believe successfully does
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   in all of his work, pace, timing, movement,
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:48.380]   clarity, speed are admirable to achieve.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.140]   - And all of that, he wants the actor
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.020]   to be as natural as possible,
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.020]   to strip away all the bullshit of acting and become human.
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.220]   - Look, I've been lucky with other directors.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.220]   Sam Mendes is similar.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.140]   I remember when I walked in to maybe the first rehearsal
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.660]   for "Richard III" that we were doing,
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.660]   I had brought with me a canopy of ailments
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.340]   that my Richard was going to suffer from.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:21.340]   And Sam eventually whittled it down to three.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.340]   Maybe your arm, and maybe your leg.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.260]   But let's get rid of the other 10 things
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.740]   that you brought into the room,
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.900]   because I was so excited to capture this character.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   So very often, Trevor Nunn is this way,
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.260]   a lot of wonderful directors I've worked with,
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.260]   they're really good at helping you trim and edit.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.860]   - David Fincher said about you,
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.780]   he's talking in general, I think,
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.500]   but also specifically in the moment of "House of Cards,"
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.580]   said that you have exceptional skill
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.940]   both as an actor and as a performer,
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.780]   which he says are different things.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.940]   So he defines the former's dramatization of a text
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.580]   and the latter as the seduction of an audience.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:14.420]   Do you see wisdom in that distinction?
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   And what does it take to do both,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.940]   the dramatization of a text
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.020]   and the seduction of an audience?
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.300]   - Those are two very interesting descriptions.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.980]   When I think, I guess when I think performer,
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.060]   I tend to think entertaining,
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.060]   I tend to think comedy,
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.860]   I tend to think winning over an audience,
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.820]   I tend to think that there's something about
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:48.100]   that quality of wanting to have people enjoy themselves
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   and when you saddle that against what maybe he means
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:02.100]   as an actor, which is more dramatic or more text driven,
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.900]   more, look, I've always believed that my job,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:13.380]   not every actor feels this way,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.340]   but my job, the way that I've looked at it
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.300]   is that my job is to serve the writing.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.580]   And that if I serve the writing,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.260]   I will, in a sense, serve myself
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.900]   because I'll be in the right world,
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.500]   I'll be in the right context,
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.860]   I'll be in the right style,
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.900]   I'll have embraced what a director's,
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.100]   it's not my painting, it's someone else's painting,
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.380]   I'm a series of colors in someone else's painting.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.700]   And the barometer for me has always been
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.700]   that when people stop me and talk to me
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:55.660]   about a character I've played and reference their name
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   as if they actually exist,
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.580]   that's when I feel like I've gotten close to doing my job.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.780]   - Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.820]   is remembering that your name is Kevin,
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.820]   not Frank or John or any of these characters
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.380]   because they live deeply in the psyche.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.380]   - To me, that's the greatest compliment
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.780]   for me as an actor.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.700]   I love being able to go,
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.700]   I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.020]   and I remember when I was young
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.420]   and I was introduced to Spencer Tracy,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.340]   Henry Fonda, Katherine Hepburn,
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.780]   I just, I believed who they were.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.820]   I knew nothing about them.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.100]   They were just these extraordinary characters
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.180]   doing this extraordinary stuff.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.180]   And then I think more recently contemporary,
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:06.060]   when I think of the work that Philip Seymour Hoffman did
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.980]   and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.860]   what they could be doing, what they could do,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.580]   what they would have done had they stayed with us,
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:23.460]   I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.900]   and I completely am taken to someplace that I believe exists
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.900]   and characters that become real.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.900]   And those characters become like lifelong companions.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.980]   Like for me, they travel with you.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.860]   And even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature,
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.900]   they're always there.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.940]   I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.740]   and gotten to become like friends with them almost.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.460]   Hannibal Lecter, whether it's the, or Forrest Gump.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.100]   I mean, I feel like I'm like best friends with Forrest Gump.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.620]   I know the guy.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.220]   And I guess he's played by some guy named Tom,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.700]   but like Forrest Gump is the guy I'm friends with.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.100]   And I think that everybody feels like that
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.860]   when they're in the audience with great characters.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.540]   They just kind of, they become part of you in some way,
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.100]   the good, the bad and the ugly of them.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:23.100]   - One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.340]   is when I read something for the first time,
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.100]   when I read a script or play,
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:37.180]   and I am absolutely devastated by it.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.940]   It is the most extraordinary, the most beautiful,
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.140]   the most life affirming or terrifying.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.940]   It's then a process weirdly of working backwards
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.020]   because I wanna work in such a way
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.700]   that that's the experience I give to the audience
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.620]   when they first see it,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.420]   that they have the experience I had when I read it.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.260]   I remember that there's been times in the creative process
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.300]   when something was pointed out to me or something was,
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.780]   I remember I was doing a play
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.620]   and I was having this really tough time
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.980]   with one of the last scenes in the play.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.100]   And I just couldn't figure it out.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.980]   I was in rehearsal.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.780]   And although we had a director in that play,
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.220]   I called another, a friend of mine who was also director.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.780]   And I had him come over and I said,
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.460]   "Look, this scene I'm just having the toughest.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.460]   "I cannot seem to crack this scene."
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.260]   And so we read it through a couple of times.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.540]   And then this wonderful director named John Swanbeck
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.860]   who would eventually direct me in a film
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.460]   called "The Big Kahuna."
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.660]   But this is before that.
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.500]   He said to me the most incredible thing.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.900]   He just said, "All right, what's the last line
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.260]   "you have in this scene before you fall over
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.100]   "and fall asleep?"
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.100]   And I said, "The last line is that last drink, the old KO."
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.740]   And he went, "Okay, I want you to think about
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.740]   "what that line actually means and then work backwards."
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.940]   And so he left and I sort of was left with this,
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.900]   what, like, what does that mean?
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.860]   How am I supposed to?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.540]   And then like a couple of days went by,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.860]   a couple of days went by and I thought,
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.220]   okay, so I said, "What does that line actually mean?"
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.500]   "Well, that last drink, the old KO."
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   KO is knockout, which is a boxing term.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:40.100]   It's the only boxing term the writer uses in the play.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.100]   And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.420]   and so incredible to have said,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.820]   "Ask a question you haven't thought of asking yet."
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.060]   I realized that the playwright wrote the last round,
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.420]   the eighth round between these two brothers
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.820]   and it was a fight, physical as well as emotional.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.980]   And when I brought that into the rehearsal room
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.500]   to the directors during that play, he liked that idea
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.420]   and we staged that scene as if it was the eighth round,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.580]   although the audience wouldn't have known that.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:18.020]   But just what I loved about that was that somebody
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.540]   said to me, "Ask yourself a question
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.780]   "you haven't asked yourself yet.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.180]   "What does that line mean?"
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.700]   And then worked backwards.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.700]   - What is that, like a catalyst for thinking deeply
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.920]   about what is magical about this play,
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.060]   this story, this narrative?
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.060]   That's what that is, like thinking backwards,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.900]   that's what that does?
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.880]   - Yeah, but also because it's just, it's this incredible,
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.980]   why didn't I think to ask that question myself?
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.100]   That's what you have directors for,
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.620]   that's what you have, you know,
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.860]   so many places where ideas can come from.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.620]   But that just illustrates that even though in my brain,
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.500]   I go, I always like to work backwards,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:01.620]   I missed it in that one and I'm very grateful to my friend
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.620]   for having pushed me into being able to realize
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.700]   what that meant and--
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.460]   - To ask the interesting question.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.260]   I like the poetry and the humility of just a series
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.180]   of colors in someone else's painting.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.220]   That was a good line.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.700]   That said, you've talked about improvisation,
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.860]   you said that it's all about the ability to do it again
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.380]   and again and again and yet never make it the same.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.460]   And you also just said that you're trying to stay true
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.860]   to the text.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.500]   So where's the room for the improvisation,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.940]   that it's never the same?
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.740]   - Well, there's two slightly different contexts, I think.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.140]   One is in the rehearsal room.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.740]   Improvisation could be a wonderful device.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.740]   I mean, Sam Mendes, for example, will start,
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.220]   he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful thing.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.460]   He brings rugs and he brings chairs and sofas in
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.780]   and he says, well, let's put two chairs here and here.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.620]   You guys, let's start in these chairs
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.100]   far apart from each other.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.420]   Let's see what happens with the scene
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.180]   if you're that far apart.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.500]   And so we'll do the scene that way.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.100]   And then he goes, okay, let's bring a rug in
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.460]   and let's bring these chairs much closer
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.260]   and let's see what happens if the space,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.300]   if the space between you is...
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.820]   And so then you try it that way.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.980]   And then, you know, it's a little harder
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.620]   in Shakespeare to improv,
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:34.940]   but in any situation where you wanna try and see where,
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.660]   where could a scene go?
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.100]   Where would the scene go if I didn't make that choice?
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.900]   Where would the scene go if I made this choice?
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.860]   Where would the scene go if I didn't say that
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.060]   or I said something else?
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.060]   So that's how improv can be a valuable process
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.420]   to learn about limits and boundaries
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:01.260]   and what's going on with a character
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.340]   that somehow you discover in trying something
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.700]   that isn't on the page.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.420]   Then there's the different thing,
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.100]   which is the trying to make it fresh
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.340]   and trying to make it new.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.100]   And that is really a reference to theater.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:22.060]   I'll put it to you this way.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.220]   Anybody loves sports, right?
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.140]   So you go and you watch on a pitch,
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.660]   you watch on a tennis game,
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.020]   you watch basketball, you watch football.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.380]   Yeah, the rules are the same,
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.060]   but it's a different game every time you're out
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.620]   on that court or on that field.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.900]   It's no different in theater.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.860]   Yes, it's the same lines.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   Maybe even blocking is similar,
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:31:00.320]   but what's different is attack, intention,
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.940]   how you are growing in a role
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.620]   and watching your fellow actors grow in theirs
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.780]   and how every night it's a new audience
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.140]   and they're reacting differently.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.620]   And you literally, where you can go
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.900]   from week one of performances in a play
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.160]   to week 12 is extraordinary.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   And the difference between theater and film
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.500]   is that no matter how good someone might think you are
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.200]   in a movie, you'll never be any better.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.060]   It's frozen.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:40.840]   Whereas I can be better tomorrow night than I was tonight.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.520]   I can be better in a week than I was tonight.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.580]   It is a living, breathing, shifting,
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:54.840]   changing, growing thing every single day.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.300]   But also in theater, there's no safety net.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.980]   If you fuck it up, everybody gets to see you do that.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.620]   And if you start giggling on stage,
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.160]   everyone gets to see you do that too,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.920]   which I am very guilty of.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.440]   in theater even more intense
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.800]   than there is when you're talking about film.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.360]   I got a chance to watch the documentary
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.860]   "Now in the Wings" on a world stage,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.380]   which is behind the scenes of, you mentioned,
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.680]   you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   to stage Richard III, a play by William Shakespeare.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.400]   I was also surprised to learn
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.200]   you haven't really done much Shakespeare,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.180]   or at least you said that in the movie.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.800]   But there's a lot of interesting
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.300]   behind the scenes stuff there.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.800]   First of all, the camaraderie of everybody,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.600]   how the bond theater creates,
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.760]   especially when you're traveling.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.480]   But another interesting thing,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.240]   you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.780]   trying different stuff.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.040]   It seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff,
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.240]   embarrassing themselves, taking risks, all of that.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.340]   I suppose that's part of acting in general,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.400]   but theater especially.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.460]   Just take risks.
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.300]   It's okay to embarrass the shit out of yourself,
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.560]   including the director.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.140]   - And it's also because you become a family.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.200]   It's unlike a movie where I might have a scene
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.960]   with so-and-so on this day,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.420]   and then another scene with them in a week and a half,
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.500]   and then that's the only scenes
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.260]   we have in the whole movie together.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.700]   Every single day, when you show up in the rehearsal room,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.940]   it's the whole company.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.820]   You're all up for it every day.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.100]   You're learning, you're growing, you're trying.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   And there is an incredible trust that happens.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.880]   And I was, of course, fortunate
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.460]   that some of the things I learned and observed
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.140]   about being a part of that family,
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.300]   being included in that family,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.300]   and being a part of creating that family,
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.260]   I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.860]   who led many companies that I was fortunate
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.420]   to work in and be a part of.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.460]   - There's also a sad moment where, at the end,
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.340]   everybody is really sad to say goodbye.
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.740]   'Cause you do form a family, and then it's over.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.820]   I guess somebody said that that's just part of theater.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.260]   It's like, I mean, there's a kind of assumed goodbye
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.320]   and that this is it.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.020]   - Yeah, and also, there are some times when,
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.380]   like six months later, I'll wake up in the middle
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.220]   of the night and I'll go,
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.100]   "Ah, that's how to play that scene."
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.620]   - Yeah.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.580]   - "Oh, God, I just finally figured it out."
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.620]   - So maybe you could speak a little bit more to that.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.400]   What's the difference between film acting
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.980]   and live theater acting?
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.180]   - I don't really think there is any.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.740]   I think there's just, you eventually learn
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.140]   about yourself on film.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.140]   When I first did my first episode of "The Equalizer,"
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.860]   it's just horrible.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.100]   It's just so bad.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.500]   But I didn't know about myself.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.340]   I didn't.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.900]   So slowly, you begin to learn about yourself.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   But I think good acting is good acting.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.540]   And I think that if a camera's right here,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.300]   you know that your front row is also your back row.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.580]   You just don't have to do so much.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:36.420]   There is, in theater, a particular kind of energy,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:41.780]   almost like an athlete, that you have to have,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.300]   vocally, to be able to get up seven performances a week
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.180]   and never lose your voice and always be there
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.620]   and always be alive and always be doing
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.180]   the best work you can,
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.060]   that you just don't require in film.
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.260]   You don't have to have the same,
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:36:02.660]   it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.500]   that doing a play does.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.420]   - It just feels like, also in theater,
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.260]   you have to become the character more intensely
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.740]   because you can't take a break.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.420]   You can't take a bathroom break.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.260]   You're on stage.
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.500]   There's no, this is you.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.360]   - Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.500]   on stage with the actors.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   I mean, I have literally laughed through speeches
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.420]   that I had to give because my fellow actors
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.900]   were putting carrots up their nose
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.700]   or broccoli in their ears
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.620]   or doing whatever they were doing to make me laugh.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.620]   - So they're just having fun.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.060]   - They're having the time of their life.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.100]   And by the way, Judi Dench is the worst giggler of all.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.780]   I mean, they had to bring the curtain down
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.540]   on her and Maggie Smith because they were laughing so hard,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.220]   they could not continue the play.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.420]   - So even when you're doing like a dramatic monologue,
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.860]   still, they're still fucking with you.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.200]   - There's stuff going on.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.100]   - Okay, that's great.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:55.020]   That's good to know.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.580]   You also said, interesting line,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.580]   that improvisation helps you learn about the character.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.340]   Can you explain that?
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.020]   So like through maybe playing with the different ways
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.300]   of saying the words or the different ways
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.140]   to bring the words to life,
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.220]   you get to learn about yourself,
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.700]   about the character you're playing.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.960]   - It can be helpful.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:28.040]   But improv is, I'm such a big believer in the writing
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.380]   and in serving the writing
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.520]   and doing the words the writer wrote.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.420]   That improv, for me,
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.820]   unless you're just doing like comedy,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.620]   and I mean, I love improv and comedy.
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.740]   It's brilliant.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.220]   So much fun to watch people
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.540]   just come up with something right there.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.860]   But that's where you're looking for laughs
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.980]   and you're specifically in a little scene
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.260]   that's being created.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.300]   But I think improv has had value,
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:04.580]   but I have not experienced it as much in doing plays
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.620]   as I have sometimes in doing film
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.580]   where you'll start off rehearsing
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.540]   and a director may say,
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.100]   "Let's just go off book and see what happens."
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.460]   And I've had moments in film where someone went off book
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.120]   and it was terrifying.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.860]   There was a scene I had in "Glengarry Glen Ross"
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:34.220]   where the character I play has fucked something up,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.460]   has just screwed something up,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.820]   and Pacino is livid.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:43.780]   And so we had the scene where Al is walking like this
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.740]   and the camera is moving with him
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   and he is shooing me a new asshole.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.060]   And in the middle of the take,
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.540]   Al starts talking about me.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:03.220]   "Oh, Kevin, you don't think we know how you got this job?
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:08.180]   You don't think we know whose dick you've been sucking on
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.500]   to get this part in this movie?"
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.540]   And I'm now, I'm literally like,
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   "I don't know what the hell is happening, but I'm reacting."
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:23.060]   We got to the end of that take,
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.980]   Al walked up to me and he went, "Oh, that was so good.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.500]   Oh my God, that was so good.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.140]   Just so you know, the sound, I asked them not to record.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.980]   So you have no dialogue, so it's just me.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.620]   Oh, that was so good.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.980]   You look like a car wreck."
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.140]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:48.100]   And it was actually an incredibly generous thing
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.700]   that he gave me so that I would react.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.300]   - Oh, wow.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.180]   Did they use that shot?
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.340]   Because you were in the shot.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.820]   - It was my closeup.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.660]   And yeah, that's the take.
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.860]   - That was an intense interaction.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.660]   I mean, what was it like,
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.060]   if we can just linger on that,
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.740]   just that intense scene with Al Pacino.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.100]   - Well, he's the reason I got the movie.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.020]   A lot of people might think because Jack was in the film
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.900]   that he had something to do with it.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.220]   But actually I was doing a play
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.420]   called "Lost in Yonkers" on Broadway.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.060]   And we had the same dresser who'd worked with him,
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.580]   a girl named Laura, it was wonderful, Laura Beattie.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:31.580]   And she told Al that he should come and see this play
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.300]   because she wanted to see me in this play.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.260]   I was playing this gangster's fun, fun, fun part.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.100]   So I didn't know Pacino came on some night
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.180]   and saw this play.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.980]   And then like three days later,
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.660]   I got a call to come in and audition
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.780]   for this "Glengarry Glen Ross,"
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.420]   which of course I knew is a play, David Mamet's play.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:56.340]   And then I auditioned.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.540]   Jamie Foley was the director
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.380]   who would eventually direct a bunch of "House of Cards."
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.780]   Wonderful, wonderful guy.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.660]   And I got the part.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.340]   Well, I didn't quite get the part.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.740]   They were gonna bring together the actors
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.060]   that they thought they were gonna give the parts to
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.540]   on a Saturday at Al's office.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.620]   And they asked me if I would come and do a read-through.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.380]   And I said, "Who's gonna be there?"
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.260]   And they said, "Well, so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so."
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.500]   And Jack Lemmon is flying in.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.180]   And I said, "Don't tell Mr. Lemmon
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.900]   that I'm doing the read-through, is that possible?"
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.260]   They were like, "Sure."
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.260]   So I'll never forget this.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:33.340]   Jack was sitting in a chair in Pacino's office
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.460]   doing the "New York Times" crossword puzzle
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.460]   as he did every day.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.300]   And I walked in the door and he went, "Oh, Jesus Christ.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.540]   "Is it possible you could get a job without me?
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.940]   "Jesus Christ, I'm so tired of holding up your end of it.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.300]   "Oh my God, Jesus."
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.340]   So I got the job because of Pacino.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:56.340]   And it was really one of the first major roles
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.420]   that I ever had in a film.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:02.460]   And to be working with that group.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.900]   - Yeah, that's like one of the greatest ensemble casts ever.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   We got Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin,
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:17.540]   Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, you, Jonathan Price.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.860]   It's just incredible.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.420]   And I have to say, I mean, maybe you can comment.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.060]   You've talked about how much of a mentor
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.700]   and a friend Jack Lemmon has been.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.660]   That's one of his greatest performances ever.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.500]   - Ever.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.060]   - You have a scene at the end of the movie with him
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.100]   that was really powerful, like firing on all cylinders.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:40.100]   You're playing disdain to perfection.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.780]   And he's playing desperation to perfection.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.500]   What a scene.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.460]   What was that like?
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.300]   Just like at the top of your game, the two of you.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.020]   - Well, by that time we had done
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.980]   "Long Day's Journey Tonight" in the theater.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:54.380]   We'd done a mini series called
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.980]   "The Murder of Mary Fagan" on NBC.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.660]   We'd done a film called "Dad"
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:03.740]   that Gary David Goldberg directed with Ted Danson.
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.260]   So this was the fourth time we were working together
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.420]   and we knew each other.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.660]   We'd become, he'd become my father figure.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.460]   And I don't know if you know
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.260]   that I originally met Jack Lemmon when I was very, very young.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.620]   He was doing a production at the Mark Taper Forum
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.620]   of a Sean O'Casey play called "Juno and the Paycock"
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.900]   with Walter Matthau and Maureen Stapleton.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.540]   And on a Saturday in December of 1974,
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.140]   my junior high school drama class went to a workshop.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.020]   It was called "How to Audition."
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.940]   And we did this workshop.
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.740]   Many schools in Southern California
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.700]   were part of this Drama Teachers Association.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.420]   So we got these incredible experiences
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.940]   of being able to go see professional productions
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.780]   and be involved in these workshops or festivals.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.660]   So I had to get up and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemmon
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.780]   when I was 13 years old.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.860]   And he walked up to me at the end of that
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.260]   and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said,
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.340]   "That was such a terrific."
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:05.420]   He said, "No, everything I've been talking about,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.300]   "you just did, what's your name?"
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.140]   I said, "Kevin."
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.220]   He said, "Wait, let me tell you something.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.580]   "When you get finished with high school,
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.420]   "as I'm sure you're gonna go on and do theater,
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.420]   "you should go to New York
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.620]   "and you should study to be an actor
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.740]   "'cause this is what you're meant to do with your life."
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.940]   And he was like an idol.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.740]   And 12 years later, I read in the New York Times
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.980]   that he was coming to Broadway
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.260]   to do this production of "A Long Day's Journey Tonight"
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.980]   a year and some months after I read this article.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.940]   And I was like, "I'm gonna play Jamie in that production."
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:42.180]   And I then, with a lot of opposition,
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.100]   'cause the cast and director didn't wanna see me,
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   they said that the director, Jonathan Miller,
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.460]   wanted movie actors to play the two sons.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:58.460]   And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller,
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:44:59.980]   the director, was coming to New York
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.580]   to do a series of lectures at Alice Tully Hall.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.880]   And I went to try to figure out how I could maybe meet him.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.700]   And I was sitting in that theater
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.060]   listening to this incredible lecture he was doing.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.160]   And sitting next to me was an elderly woman.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.480]   I mean, elderly, 80-something, and she was asleep.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:31.780]   But sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor,
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.780]   was an invitation to a cocktail reception
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.460]   in honor of Dr. Jonathan Miller.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.460]   And so I thought, "You know, she's tired.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.140]   "She's probably gonna go home."
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.140]   So I took that and walked into this cocktail reception,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.880]   and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller,
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.580]   who was incredibly kind, and said,
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.680]   "Sit down, I'm always very curious.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.340]   "What brings young people to my lectures?"
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:06.060]   And I said to him, "Eugene O'Neill brought me here."
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.060]   And he was like, "What, what, what?
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:07.900]   "I've always wanted to meet him.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.060]   "Where is he?"
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.780]   And I told him that I'd been trying for seven months
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.900]   to get an audition for "A Long Day's Journey,"
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.480]   and that his American cast directors were telling my agents
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.620]   that he wanted big American movie stars.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.880]   And at that moment, he turned and he saw
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.580]   one of those cast directors who was there that night.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.620]   'Cause I knew he was gonna be in New York
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.260]   starting auditions that week.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:39.640]   And she was staring daggers at me, and he just got it.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.180]   And he said, "Does someone have a pen?"
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.020]   And he took a little paper and started writing.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.460]   He said, "Listen, Kevin, there are many situations
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.280]   "in which casting directors have a lot of say
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.980]   "and a lot of power and a lot of leverage.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.660]   "And then there are other situations
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.580]   "where they just take directors' messages.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.220]   "And on this one, they're taking my messages.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.060]   "This is where I'm staying.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.380]   "Make sure your people get to me.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.360]   "We start auditions on Thursday."
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.740]   And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.860]   and audition for this play
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.060]   that I'd been working on and preparing.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   And at the end of it, I did four scenes at the end of it.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.940]   He said to me that unless someone else came in
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.340]   and blew him against the wall like I had just done,
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:22.780]   as far as he was concerned, I pretty much had the part,
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.900]   but I couldn't tell my agents that yet
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.820]   'cause I had to come back and read with Mr. Lemon.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.520]   And so three months later, in August of 1985,
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.900]   I found myself in a room with Jack Lemon again
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.820]   at 890 Broadway, which is where they rehearse
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.220]   a lot of the Broadway plays.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.620]   And we did four scenes together,
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.300]   and I was toppling over him, I was pushing him.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.640]   I was relentless.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.240]   And I'll never forget at the end of that,
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.220]   Lemon came over to me, he put his hand on my shoulder,
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:57.680]   and he said, "That was a touch of terrific.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.100]   "I never thought we'd find the rotten kid,
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.700]   "but he's it, Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?"
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.140]   And I ended up spending the next year
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.500]   of my life with that man.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.780]   - So it turns out he was right.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.560]   - Yeah.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.860]   - This world works in mysterious ways.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.420]   It also speaks to the fact of the power
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.980]   of somebody you look up to giving words of encouragement,
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.620]   'cause those can just reverberate through your whole life
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.780]   and just make the path clear.
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:35.660]   - I've always, we used to joke that if every contract
[00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.180]   came with a Jack Lemon clause,
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.980]   it would be a more beautiful world.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.540]   - Beautifully said.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.980]   Jack Lemon is one of the greatest actors ever.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.840]   What do you think makes him so damn good?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.040]   - Wow.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:49:00.700]   I think he truly set out in his life
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.760]   to accomplish what his father said to him on his deathbed.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.120]   His father was dying, his father was, by the way,
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.340]   called the Donut King in Boston,
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.640]   and not in the entertainment business at all.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.440]   He literally owned a donut company.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.520]   And when he was passing away, Jack said,
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.200]   "The last thing my father said to me was,
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.400]   "go out there and spread a little sunshine."
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.840]   And I truly think that's what Jack loved to do.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   I remember this, and I don't know if this is,
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:46.040]   will answer your question, but I think it's revealing
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.920]   about what he's able to do and what he was able to do
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.660]   and how that ultimately influenced what I was able to do.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:50:00.260]   Sam Mendes had never directed a film before "American Beauty."
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:07.080]   And so what he did was he took the best elements of theater
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.360]   and applied them to the process.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.180]   So we rehearsed it like a play in a soundstage
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.640]   where everything was laid out like it would be in a play,
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.040]   and this couch will be here.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:23.000]   And he'd sent me a couple of tapes.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.020]   He'd sent me two cassette tapes,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.280]   one that he'd like to call pre-Lester
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.580]   before he begins to move in a new direction,
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.640]   and then post-Lester, and they just were different songs.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.000]   And then he said to me one day,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.280]   and I always thought this was brilliant of Sam
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.580]   to use "Lemon," knowing what "Lemon" meant to me.
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.320]   He said, "When was the last time you watched 'The Apartment'?"
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:53.440]   And I said, "I don't know, I love that movie so much."
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.440]   He goes, "I want you to watch it again, and then let's talk."
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:00.560]   So I went and I watched the movie again.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.860]   And we sat down, and Sam said,
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:10.860]   "What 'Lemon' does in that film is incredible,
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.100]   "because there is never a moment in the movie
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.960]   "where we see him change.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:22.300]   "He just evolves, and he becomes the man he becomes
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:26.400]   "because of the experiences that he has
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.140]   "through the course of the film,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:33.020]   "but there's this remarkable consistency in who he becomes,
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.140]   "and that's what I need you to do as Lester.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.520]   "I don't want the audience to ever see him change.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.300]   "I want him to evolve."
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.100]   And so we did some, I mean, first of all,
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.600]   it was just a great direction.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.100]   And then second of all, we did some things
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.720]   that people don't know we did
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   to aid that gradual shift,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:51:59.920]   of that man's character.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   First of all, I had to be in the best shape
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.840]   from the beginning of the movie,
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.880]   'cause we didn't shoot it in sequence.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.880]   So I was in this crazy shape.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.760]   I had this wonderful trainer named Mike Torsha,
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.320]   who just was incredible.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:18.120]   But so what we did was, in order to then show
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.880]   this gradual shift, was I had three different hair pieces.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.600]   I had three different kinds of costumes
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.680]   of different colors and sizes.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.560]   And I had different makeup.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.960]   So in the beginning, I was wearing a kind of drab,
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:39.960]   dull, slightly, you know, uninspired hair piece.
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:44.160]   And my makeup was kind of gray and boring.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.200]   And I was a little bit,
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.280]   there were times when I was like too much like this,
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.200]   and Sam would go, "Kevin, you look like Walter Matthau.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.460]   "Would you please stand up a little bit?
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.640]   "We're sort of midway through at this point."
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.560]   And then at a certain point, the wig changed,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.240]   and it had little highlights in it,
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.880]   a little more color, a little more,
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.200]   the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.920]   And then finally, a third wig that was golden highlights
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   and sunshine and, you know, rosy cheeks and tight fit.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.160]   And these are what we call theatrical tricks.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   You know, this is how you,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.520]   an audience doesn't even know it's happening,
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.160]   but it is this gradual.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160]   And I just always felt that that was such a brilliant way,
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.760]   because he knew what I felt about Jack.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.040]   And when you watch "The Apartment,"
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:42.480]   it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.040]   He just, so I'm,
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:53.080]   and in fact, I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   And I did my thank you speech and I walked off stage.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:05.920]   And I remember I had to sit down for a moment
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.440]   because I didn't want to go to the press room
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.060]   because I wanted to see if Sam was gonna win.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:17.240]   And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was Lemon.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   He said, "You're a son of a bitch."
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.080]   I said, "What?"
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.840]   He goes, "First of all, congratulations
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.920]   and thanks for thanking me.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.240]   'Cause you know, God knows
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.680]   you couldn't have done it without me."
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.420]   He said, "Second of all," he said,
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.320]   "Do you know how long it took me to win
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.440]   from supporting actor?
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.340]   I won it for Mr. Roberts and it took me like 10, 12 years
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.180]   to win an Oscar.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.080]   You did it in four, you son of a bitch."
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:45.660]   - Yeah, "The Apartment" was,
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.880]   I mean, it's widely considered
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.480]   one of the greatest movies ever.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.080]   People sometimes refer to it as a comedy,
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.400]   which is an interesting kind of classification.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.880]   I suppose that's a lesson about comedy
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   that the best comedy is the one that's basically a tragedy.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.280]   - Well, I mean, some people think
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.840]   "Clockwork Orange" is a comedy.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.280]   And I'm not saying there aren't some good laughs
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.880]   in "Clockwork Orange," but yeah, you know, it's.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.280]   - I mean, yeah.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   What's that line between comedy and tragedy for you?
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:21.520]   (exhaling)
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.560]   - Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.560]   because I've tried always to find the humor
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:39.560]   unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate sometimes,
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.360]   maybe shocking, but I've tried,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:47.240]   and I think almost every dramatic role I've had
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring that
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.040]   along with everything else that is serious.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.680]   Because frankly, that's how we deal with stuff in life.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.040]   You know?
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.540]   - I think Sam Mendes actually said in the "Now" documentary,
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:13.200]   something like, "With great theater, with great stories,
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.880]   "you find humor on the journey to the heart of darkness."
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:18.880]   Something like this.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:20.920]   Very poetic.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.740]   - Yeah.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:22.580]   - But it's true.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.440]   - I'm sorry I can't be that poetic.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.280]   I'm very sorry.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.100]   - But it's true.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.880]   I mean, the people I've interacted in this world
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   have been to a war zone, and the ones who have lost the most
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.440]   and have suffered the most are usually the ones
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.960]   who are able to make jokes the quickest.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.460]   And the jokes are often dark and absurd
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.520]   and cross every single line.
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.440]   No political correctness, all of that.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.320]   - Sure.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.240]   Well, I mean, it's like the "Great Mary Tyler Moore Show"
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.880]   where they can't stop giggling at the clown's funeral.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.780]   I mean, it's just one of the great episodes ever.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:03.760]   Giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.700]   And I'm sure that there's some people who've done both.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.580]   - Oh, man.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:13.320]   So you mentioned "American Beauty."
[00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:19.620]   And the idea of not changing but evolving,
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.020]   that's really interesting,
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:25.220]   because that movie is about finding yourself.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:28.020]   It's a philosophically profound movie.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.540]   It's about various characters in their own ways
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.500]   finding their own identity in a world
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   where maybe a system, a materialistic system
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.900]   that wants you to be like everyone else.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.780]   And so, I mean, Lester just really transforms himself
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.620]   throughout the movie.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.420]   And you're saying the challenge there
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.080]   is to still be the same human being fundamentally.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:57.860]   - Yeah, and I also think that the film was powerful
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:05.460]   because you had three very honest
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.640]   and genuine portrayal of young people.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.900]   And then you had Lester behaving like a young person.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   Doing things that were unexpected.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:20.740]   And I think that the honesty with which it dealt
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:27.900]   with those issues that those teenagers were going through
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.180]   and the honesty with which it dealt
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.340]   with what Lester was going through,
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:36.260]   I think are some of the reasons why the film
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:41.260]   had the response that it did from so many people.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.860]   I mean, I used to get stopped.
[00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.300]   And someone would say to me,
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.940]   "When I first saw 'American Beauty,' I was married.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:53.280]   "And the second time I saw it, I wasn't."
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.300]   And I was like,
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.580]   "Well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate.
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.620]   "It wasn't our intention."
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.820]   But it is interesting how so many people
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:10.380]   have those kinds of crazy fantasies.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:15.380]   And what I admired so much about who Lester was
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.020]   as a person, why I wanted to play him,
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.360]   is because in the end, he makes the right decision.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.900]   - I think a lot of people live lives of quiet desperation
[00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:29.780]   in a job they don't like,
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:34.860]   in a marriage they're unhappy in.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.460]   And to see somebody living that life
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:42.620]   and then saying, "Fuck it," in every way possible.
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.540]   And not just in a cynical way,
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.900]   but in a way that opens them,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.700]   opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.660]   That's, you know, the beauty in "American Beauty."
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:54.860]   - Well, and you know, you may have to blackmail your boss
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:56.260]   to get there, but, you know.
[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.400]   - And in that, there's a bunch of humor also.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.400]   In the anger, in the absurdity of sort of taking a stand
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.180]   against the conformity of life, there's this humor.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.820]   And I read somewhere that the scene, the dinner scene,
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:19.820]   which is kind of play-like, where Lester slams the plate
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.820]   against the wall, was improvised by you,
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.740]   the slamming of the plate against the wall?
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.980]   - No. - No?
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.140]   - Absolutely. - The internet
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.060]   lies on the stand. - Absolutely.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.620]   - Written and directed.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.620]   Yeah, can't take credit for that.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:41.460]   - The plate, okay.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.860]   Well, that was a genius interaction there.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:47.060]   There's something about the dinner table
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.740]   and losing your shit at the dinner table.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.540]   Having a fight and losing your shit at the dinner table.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.580]   Where else?
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.940]   Like, "Yellowstone" was another situation
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.900]   where it's a family at the dinner table,
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.380]   and then one of them says, "Fuck it,
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.860]   "I'm not eating this anymore,
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.900]   "and I'm going to create a scene."
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:10.900]   It's a beautiful kind of environment for dramatic scenes.
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.500]   - Or "Nicholson and the Shining."
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.420]   I mean, there's some family scenes gone awry in that movie.
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.860]   - The contrast between you and Annette Bening in that scene
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.140]   creates the genius of that scene.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.320]   So how much of acting is the dance between two actors?
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.600]   (exhaling)
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   - Well, with Annette, I just adored working with her.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.800]   And we were the two actors that Sam wanted
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.520]   from the very beginning, much against the will
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.720]   of the higher-ups who wanted other actors
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.600]   to play those roles.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   But I've known Annette since we did a screen test together
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.400]   for Milos Forman for a film he did
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.200]   of the "Les Livres Endangerous" movie.
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.760]   It was a different film from that one,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.400]   but it was the same story.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.340]   And I've always thought she is just remarkable.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.880]   And I think that the work she did in that film,
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   the relationship that we were able to build,
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:27.980]   for me, the saddest part of that success
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.320]   was that she didn't win the Oscar.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.120]   And I felt she should have.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.440]   - What kind of interesting direction did you get
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.080]   from Sam Mendes in how you approached playing Lester
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.400]   and how to take on the different scenes?
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.760]   There's a lot of just brilliant scenes in that movie.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.520]   - Well, I'll share with you a story
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.000]   that most people don't know,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.080]   which is our first two days of shooting
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:02.220]   were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job,
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.640]   at a fast food place.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.560]   - Yeah, it's a burger joint, yeah.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.200]   - And I guess it was like maybe the third day
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.400]   or the fourth day of shooting, we'd now done that.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   And I said to Sam, "So how are the dailies?
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.600]   How do they look?"
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.840]   He goes, "Which ones?"
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.960]   I said, "Well, the first Smiley's."
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.720]   He goes, "Oh, they're shit."
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.700]   And I went, "Yeah, no, how were they?"
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.100]   He goes, "No, they're shit.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.180]   I hate them.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.340]   I hate everything about them.
[01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.780]   I hate the costumes.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.040]   I hate the location.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.120]   I hate that you're inside.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.860]   I hate the way you acted.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.340]   I hate everything but the script."
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.940]   So I've gone back to the studio
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.540]   and asked them if we can reshoot the first two days.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   And it was like, "Sam, this is your very first movie.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.320]   You're going back to Steven Spielberg and saying,
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.600]   'I need to reshoot the first two days entirely?'"
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.860]   And he went, "Yeah."
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.960]   And that's exactly what we did.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.600]   A couple of weeks later,
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.460]   they decided that it was now a drive-thru
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.000]   because Annette and Peter Geller used to come into the place
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.720]   and order from the counter.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.440]   Now, Sam had decided it has to be a drive-thru.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.480]   You have to be in the window of the drive-thru,
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.120]   change the costumes.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   And we reshot those first two days.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.760]   And Sam said it was actually a moment
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.820]   of incredible confidence because he said,
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.400]   "The worst thing that could possibly have happened
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.520]   happened in my first two days."
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.960]   And after that, I was like, "I know what I'm doing."
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.320]   And I knew I had to reshoot it.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.000]   And it was absolutely right.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.320]   - And I guess that's what a great director must do
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.100]   is have the guts in that moment to reshoot everything.
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.720]   I mean, that's a pretty gutsy move.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.120]   - Two other little things to share with you about Sam,
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.300]   about the way he is.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.240]   You wouldn't know it,
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.300]   but the original script opened and closed with a trial.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:17.120]   Ricky was accused of Lester's murder.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.280]   And the movie was book-ended by this trial.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.800]   - It's a very different movie.
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   - Which they shot the entire trial for weeks.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.720]   Okay? - Wow, yeah.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.840]   - And I used to fly in my dreams.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.200]   You know, those opening shots over the neighborhood?
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.200]   I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe, flying.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.640]   And then when I hit the ground and the newspaper
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.680]   was thrown at me by the newspaper guy
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.520]   and I caught it,
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.640]   the alarm would go off and I'd wake up in bed.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.320]   I spent five days being hung by wires
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.280]   and filming these sequences of flying through my dreams.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.960]   And Sam said to me, "Yeah, the flying sequences
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.880]   "are all gone, and the trial is gone."
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.800]   And I was like, "What, what are you talking about?"
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:15.480]   And here's my other little favorite story about Sam.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.180]   When we were shooting in the valley,
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:21.740]   one of those places I flew, this was an indoor set.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:26.960]   Sam said to me in the morning, "Hey, at lunch,
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:30.360]   "I just wanna record a guide track of all the dialogue,
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.760]   "all of your narration, 'cause they just needed
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.040]   "an editing as a guide."
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.200]   And I said, "Sure."
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.280]   So I remember we came outside in this hallway
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.320]   where I had a dressing room in this little studio
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.840]   we were in, and Sam had a cassette tape recorder
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.340]   and like a little microphone.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.440]   And we put it on the floor and he pushed record.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.920]   And I read the entire narration,
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.800]   and I never did it again.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.820]   That's the narration in the movie.
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.840]   Because Sam said, when he listened to it,
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:13.360]   "I wasn't trying to do anything."
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.420]   He said, "You had no idea where these things were going,
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.640]   "where they were gonna be placed,
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.240]   "what they were gonna mean.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.780]   "You just read it so innocently, so purely,
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.120]   "so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.360]   "and put headphones on you and had you do it again,
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   "it would change the ease with which you'd done it."
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.320]   And so they just fixed all of the problems
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.560]   that they had with this little cassette.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.240]   And that is the way I did it,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.940]   and the only time I did it was in this little hallway.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.200]   - And once again, a great performance
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:55.500]   lies in being, doing less.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.920]   - The innocence and the purity of lust.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.280]   - He knew I would've come into the studio and fucked it up.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.600]   (laughing)
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.440]   - Yeah.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.320]   What do you think about the notion of beauty
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.760]   that permeates American beauty?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.160]   What do you think that theme is with the roses,
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.080]   with the rose petals, the characters
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   that are living this mundane existence
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   slowly opening their eyes up to what is beautiful in life?
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.400]   - See, it's funny, I don't think of the roses
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   and I don't think of her body in the poster
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.800]   and I don't think of those things as the beauty.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.320]   I think of the bag.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   And I think that there are things we miss
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.800]   that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.680]   - The little things, the simple things.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.560]   - Yeah, and in fact, I'll even tell you something
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.660]   that I always thought was so incredible.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:03.500]   When we shot the scenes in the office
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.800]   where Lester worked, the job he hated,
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.560]   there was a bulletin board behind me on a wall.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:16.600]   And someone who was watching a cut or early dailies
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.000]   who was in the marketing department
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.120]   saw that someone had cut out a little piece of paper
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.260]   and stuck it and it said, "Look closer."
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:33.240]   And they presented that to Sam as the idea
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.000]   of what that could go on the poster.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   The idea of looking closer was such a brilliant idea,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.360]   but it wasn't in the script,
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.560]   it was just on a wall behind me
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:51.040]   and someone happened to zoom in on it and see it
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.240]   and thought, that's what this movie's about.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.700]   This movie's about taking the time to look closer.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.680]   And I think that in itself is just beautiful.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.440]   - Mortality also permeates the film.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.240]   You know, it starts with acknowledging
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   that death is on the way, that Lester's time is finite.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.520]   You ever think about your own death?
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.440]   - Scared of it?
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:29.880]   - When I was at my lowest point, yes, it scared me.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   - What does that fear look like?
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.280]   What's the nature of the fear?
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.520]   What are you afraid of?
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.620]   - That there's no way out.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   That there's no answer.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:54.900]   That nothing makes sense.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.320]   - See, the interesting thing about Lester
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.820]   is facing the same fear,
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:08.680]   he seemed to be somehow liberated and accepted everything.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.120]   - Yeah. - And then saw the beauty of it.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.800]   - 'Cause he got there.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   He was given the opportunity to reinvent himself
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.880]   and to try things he'd never tried,
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.600]   to ask questions he'd never asked,
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.600]   to trust his instincts
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:35.240]   and to become the best version of himself he could become.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.880]   And so Dick Van Dyke,
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.240]   who has become an extraordinary friend of mine,
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.880]   Dick is 98 years old.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.080]   And he says, "You know, if I'd known
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.040]   "I was gonna live this long,
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   "I would've taken better care of myself."
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.840]   When I spend time with him,
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.800]   I'm just moved by every day, you know?
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.400]   He gets up and he goes, "It's a good day, I woke up."
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.320]   And I learn a lot about,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:15.040]   I have a different feeling about death now
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.740]   than I did seven years ago.
[01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.700]   (silence)
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:28.820]   And I'm on the path to being able to be in a place
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:33.180]   where I've resolved the things I needed to resolve.
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.300]   And I won't probably get to all of it in my lifetime,
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.820]   but I certainly would like to be in a place
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.060]   where if I were to drop dead tomorrow,
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.700]   it would've been an amazing life.
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.980]   - So Lester got there, sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there,
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.020]   you're trying to get there.
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:51.860]   - Sure.
[01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:56.620]   - You said you feared death at your lowest point.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.940]   What was the lowest point?
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:03.860]   - It was November 1st of 2017,
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.980]   and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:14.040]   - So let's talk about it, let's talk about this dark time.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.660]   Let's talk about the sexual allegations against you
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:21.980]   that led to you being canceled by, well,
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.380]   the entire world for the last seven years.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:29.020]   I would like to personally understand the sins,
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.660]   the bad things you did, and the bad things you didn't do.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:37.260]   So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:41.760]   is to give respect to due process,
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.420]   innocent until proven guilty,
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:49.100]   that the mass hysteria machine of the internet
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:52.940]   and clickbait journalism doesn't do.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:54.800]   So here's what I understand.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.700]   There were criminal and civil trials brought against you,
[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:02.540]   including the one that started it all
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.020]   when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.760]   In these trials, you were acquitted,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.300]   found not guilty, and not liable.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.140]   Is that right?
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.140]   - Yes.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.900]   - I think that's really important,
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.180]   again, in terms of due process.
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.940]   And I read a lot, and I watched a lot
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.440]   in preparation for this on this point,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.620]   including, of course, the recently detailed interviews
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.420]   you did with Dan Wooten,
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.820]   and then Alison Pearson of The Telegraph,
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.260]   and those are all focused on this topic,
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.400]   and they go in detail where you respond in detail
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.660]   to many of the allegations.
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.100]   If people are interested in the details,
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.300]   they can listen to those.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.880]   So based on that and everything I looked at,
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.820]   as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.740]   if they wanted to, sort of in a sexual context,
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.940]   for example, by blocking the door, is that right?
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.100]   - That's correct, yeah.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.100]   - You always respected the explicit no from people,
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.140]   again, in the sexual context, is that right?
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.380]   - That is correct.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:07.220]   - You've never done anything sexual
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.620]   with an underage person, right?
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.580]   - Never.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:13.820]   - And also, as is sometimes done in Hollywood,
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.200]   let me ask this, you've never explicitly offered
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.500]   to exchange sexual favors for career advancement, correct?
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.620]   - Correct.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.640]   - In terms of bad behavior, what did you do?
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:28.620]   What was the worst of it, and how often did you do it?
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:31.340]   - I have heard, and now, quite often,
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.640]   that everybody has a Kevin Spacey story,
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.660]   and what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.480]   - How often did you cross the line,
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.020]   and what does that mean to you?
[01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:44.460]   - I did a lot of horsing around.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.900]   I did a lot of things that, at the time,
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.580]   I thought were sort of playful and fun,
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:51.420]   and I have learned since we're not,
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:56.420]   and I have had to recognize that I crossed some boundaries,
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.020]   and I did some things that were wrong,
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:03.260]   and I made some mistakes, and that's in my past.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.540]   I mean, I've been working so hard
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.100]   over these last seven years to have the conversations
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.760]   I needed to have, to listen to people,
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.440]   to understand things from a different perspective
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.840]   than the one that I had, and to say,
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:21.340]   I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:26.340]   - Just to clarify, I think you're often too pushy
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:31.380]   with the flirting, and that manifests itself
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:35.120]   in multiple ways, but just to make clear,
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.560]   you never prevented anyone from leaving
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.480]   if they wanted to, you always took the explicit no
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.460]   from people as an answer, no, stop.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.960]   You took that for the answer.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.700]   You've never done anything sexual with an underage person,
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:55.800]   and you've never explicitly offered
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.120]   to exchange sexual favors for career advancement.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.480]   These are some of the sort of accusations
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.560]   that have been made, and in the court of law,
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:08.040]   multiple times have been shown not to be true.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.920]   But I have had a sexual life, and I've fallen in love,
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.760]   and I've been so admiring of people that I,
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.960]   I mean, I'm so romantic, I'm such a romantic person
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.400]   that there's this whole side of me
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.480]   that hasn't been talked about, isn't being discussed,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.840]   but that's who I know, that's the person I know.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.840]   It's been very upsetting to hear that some people
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.260]   have said, I mean, I don't have a violent bone in my body,
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.960]   but to hear people describe things
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.920]   as having been very aggressive
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.440]   is incredibly difficult for me.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.480]   And I'm deeply sorry that I ever offended anyone
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.040]   or hurt anyone in any way.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:57.040]   It is crushing to me, and I have to work very hard
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.180]   to show and to prove that I have learned,
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:05.000]   I got the memo, and I will never, ever,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.840]   ever behave in those ways again.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.220]   From everything I've seen in public interactions with you,
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.060]   people love you.
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.340]   Colleagues love you, coworkers love you.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.820]   There's a flirtatiousness, another word for that
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.180]   is chemistry, there's a chemistry
[01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:20.540]   between the people you work with.
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.720]   - And by the way, not to take anything away
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.660]   from my accountability for things I did
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.100]   where I got it wrong, I crossed the line,
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.560]   I pushed some boundaries, I accept all of that,
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:35.400]   but I live in an industry in which flirtation,
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.700]   attraction, people meeting in the workspace
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.400]   and ending up marrying each other and having children,
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   and so it is a space and a place
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.520]   where these notions of family,
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.460]   these notions of attraction, these notions of,
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.840]   it's always complicated if you meet someone
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.680]   in the workspace and find yourselves
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.260]   attracted to each other.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:05.720]   You have to be mindful of that,
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.680]   and you have to be very mindful
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.480]   that you don't ever want anyone to feel
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.280]   that their job is in jeopardy,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.500]   or you would punish them in some way
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.480]   if they no longer wanted to be with you.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:24.480]   So those are important things to just acknowledge.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.360]   - Another complexity to this, as I've seen,
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.100]   is that there's just a huge number of actors
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.320]   that look up to you, a huge number of people
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.520]   in the industry that look up to you,
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.960]   so just, and love you.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.680]   I've seen just from this documentary,
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.800]   just a lot of people just love being around you,
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.680]   learning from you what it means to create great theater,
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.520]   great film, great stories,
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.400]   and so that adds to the complexity.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.040]   I wouldn't say it's a power dynamic
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.020]   like a boss-employee relationship.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:59.020]   It's a admiration dynamic that is easy to miss
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.040]   and easy to take advantage of.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.640]   Is that something you understand?
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.900]   - Yes, and I also understand that there are people
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:11.440]   who met me and spent a very brief period of time with me,
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.960]   but presumed I was now going to be their mentor,
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.920]   and then behaved in a way that I was unaware of,
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:26.280]   that they were either participating or flirting along
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:30.400]   or encouraging me without me having any idea
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.880]   that at the end of the day they were expecting something.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:41.200]   So these are about relationships.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.800]   These are about two people.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.680]   These are about people making decisions,
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   people making choices, and I accept my accountability
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.200]   in that, but there are a number of things
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.200]   that I've been accused of that just simply did not happen,
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.200]   and I can't say, and I don't think it would be right
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:08.400]   for me to say, well, everything that I've been accused of
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.480]   is true because we've now proved that it isn't,
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.680]   and it wasn't, but I'm perfectly willing to accept
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.000]   that I had behaviors that were wrong
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   and that I shouldn't have done, and I am regretful for.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.360]   I think that also speaks to a dark side of fame.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.520]   The sense I got is that there are some people,
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.920]   potentially a lot of people, trying to make friends
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.600]   with you in order to get roles,
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.840]   in order to advance their career.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.560]   So not you using them, but they trying to use you.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:50.320]   What's that like?
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:54.240]   How do you know if somebody likes you for you, for Kevin,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.240]   or likes you for, like you said, you're romantic.
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.700]   You see a person, and you're like, I like this person,
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:07.160]   and they seem to like you.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.200]   How do you know if they like you for you?
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:15.200]   - Well, to some degree, I would say that I have been able
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.740]   to trust my instincts on that,
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.200]   and that I've most of the time been right,
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.880]   but obviously in the last number of years,
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.560]   not just with people who've accused me,
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.760]   but just also people in my own industry,
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.560]   to realize that, oh, I thought we had a friendship,
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.720]   but I guess that was about an inch thick
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:37.240]   and not what I thought it was.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:42.520]   But look, one shouldn't be surprised by that.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.360]   I have to also say, you said a little while ago
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.760]   that the world had canceled me,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.560]   and I have to disagree with you.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.140]   I have to disagree because for seven years,
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.680]   I've been stopped by people, sometimes every day,
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.100]   sometimes multiple, multiple times a day,
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:05.000]   and the conversations that I have with people,
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.720]   the generosity that they share, the kindness that they show,
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.640]   and how much they wanna know when I'm getting back to work,
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:19.020]   tells me that while there may be a very loud minority,
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.800]   there is a quieter majority.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   - In the industry, have you been betrayed in life?
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.840]   And how do you not let that make you cynical?
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:37.540]   - I think betrayal is a really interesting word,
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:41.340]   but I think if you're going to be betrayed,
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:44.680]   it has to be by those who truly know you,
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.840]   and I can tell you that I have not been betrayed.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.300]   - That's a beautiful way to put it.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.740]   For the times you crossed the line,
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.740]   do you take responsibility for the wrongs you've done?
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:01.140]   - Yes.
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:05.180]   - Are you sorry to the people you may have hurt emotionally?
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:06.000]   - Yes, yes.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   And I have spoken to many of them.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.580]   - Privately.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.280]   - Privately, which is where amends should be made.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.120]   - Were they able to start finding forgiveness?
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.140]   - Absolutely.
[01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:26.080]   Some of the most moving conversations that I have had
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:33.480]   when I was determined to take accountability
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.720]   have been those people who said, thank you so much,
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:40.720]   and I think I can forgive you now.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.720]   - If you got a chance to talk to the Kevin Spacey
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.980]   of 30 to 40 years ago,
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:51.700]   what would you tell him to change about his ways?
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.860]   How would you do it, what would be your approach?
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.980]   Would you be nice about it, would you smack him around?
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:00.880]   - I think if I were to go back that far,
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.300]   I probably would have found a way to
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:10.420]   not have been as concerned about revealing my sexuality
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.580]   and hiding that for as long as I did.
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:17.580]   I think that had a lot to do with confusion
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:20.540]   and a lot to do with mistrust,
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.240]   both my own and other people's.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.940]   - For most of your life, you were not open
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:29.820]   with the public about being gay.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.100]   What was the hardest thing about keeping
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.680]   who you love a secret?
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:39.540]   - That I didn't find the right moment
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:46.260]   of celebration to be able to share that.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.420]   - That must be a thing that weighs on you
[01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:52.020]   to not be able to fully
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:56.980]   yeah, celebrate your love.
[01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:00.300]   - You know, Ian McKellen said,
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:05.460]   after 40, he was 49 when he came out,
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.660]   27 years he'd been a professional actor,
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:10.420]   being in the closet.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.500]   And he said he felt it was like he was
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:18.260]   living a part of his life, not being truthful.
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.540]   And that he felt that it affected his work
[01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:24.420]   when he did come out because he no longer felt
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:26.020]   like he had anything to hide.
[01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:31.020]   And I absolutely believe that that is what my experience
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.060]   has been and will continue to be.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.220]   I am sorry about the way I came out,
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:44.660]   but Evan and I had already had the conversation.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.380]   I had already decided to come out.
[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:50.540]   And so it wasn't like, oh, I was forced to come out,
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.460]   but it was something I decided to do.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.260]   And by the way, much against Evan's advice,
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.780]   I came out in that statement
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:00.340]   and he wishes that I had not done so.
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.980]   - Yeah, you made a statement
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:07.700]   when the initial accusation happened.
[01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:12.300]   That could be up there as one of the worst
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.220]   social media posts of all time.
[01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:19.860]   It's like two for one.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.300]   - Don't hold back, no, come on.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.140]   Really tell me how you feel.
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:26.860]   - The first part, you kind of implicitly admitted
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.900]   to doing something bad, which was later shown
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.340]   and proved completely to never have happened.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.060]   It was a lie.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:37.740]   - No, I basically said that I didn't remember
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.900]   what this person was, that Anthony Rapp was claiming
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:43.380]   from 31 years before.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:45.460]   I had no memory of it, but if it had happened,
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.420]   if this embarrassing moment had happened,
[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:49.260]   then I would owe him an apology.
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:50.500]   That was what I said.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.500]   And then I said, and while I'm at it,
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.500]   I think I'll come out.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.660]   And it was definitely not the greatest
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:58.820]   coming out party ever, I will admit that.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.900]   - From the public reception, the first part of that,
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:04.020]   so first of all, the second part is a horrible way
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.860]   to come out, yes, we all agree.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:09.180]   And then the first part, from the public viewpoint,
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:13.340]   they see guilt in that, which also is tragic
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.300]   because at least that particular accusation,
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.420]   and it's a very dramatic one,
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.100]   it's a $40 million lawsuit, it's a big deal,
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.860]   and an underage person was shown to be false.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:28.060]   - Well, but you're melding two things together.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.380]   The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020,
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:32.860]   and then it didn't get to court until 2022.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:35.460]   We're back in 2017 when it was just an accusation
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.660]   he made in "Buzzfeed" magazine.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:43.020]   Look, I was backed into a corner.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.980]   When someone says, "You were so drunk,
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.180]   you won't remember this thing happened,"
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.340]   what's your first instinct?
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:52.700]   Is your first instinct to say, "This person's a liar,"
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:56.500]   or is your first instinct to go, "What?
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.380]   I was, what, 31 years at a party
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.340]   I don't even remember throwing?"
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.780]   Obviously, a lot of investigation happened after that
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:09.020]   in which we were then able to prove in that court case
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.740]   that it had never occurred.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.860]   But at the moment, I was sort of being told
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:19.860]   I couldn't push back, you have to be kind, you can't...
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:25.100]   I think even to me now, none of it sounds right,
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.220]   but I don't know that I could have said anything
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.300]   that would have been satisfactory to anybody.
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.780]   - Okay, there's an almost convincing explanation
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.940]   for the worst social media posts of all time.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:38.460]   I almost accept it.
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.820]   - I'm really surprised.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:41.660]   I guess you haven't read a lot of media posts
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:44.300]   'cause I can't believe that's the actual worst one.
[01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:48.460]   - It's beautifully bad is how bad that social media post is.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:51.520]   As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.500]   came out in support of you recently,
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.900]   speaking to your character.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:01.500]   A lot of people who know you, and some of whom I know,
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.460]   who have worked with you privately, show support for you,
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.380]   but are afraid to speak up publicly.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:08.820]   What do you make of that?
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.980]   I mean, to me personally, this just makes me sad
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.580]   because perhaps that's the nature of the industry,
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:17.460]   that it's difficult to do that,
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:19.500]   but I just wish there would be
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.100]   a little bit more courage in the world.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.620]   - I don't think it's about the industry,
[01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:24.020]   I think it's about our time.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.940]   I think it's the time that we're in,
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.180]   and people are very afraid.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.980]   - Just afraid, just a general fear.
[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:33.660]   - No, they're literally afraid
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:36.620]   that they're gonna get canceled
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.820]   if they stand up for someone who has been.
[01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:46.860]   And I think it's, I mean, we've seen this many times
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:50.260]   in history, this is not the first time it's happened.
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:54.980]   - So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017,
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.100]   when all of this went down,
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.620]   one of the things that happened is you were no longer
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.500]   in the House of Cards for the last season.
[01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.100]   Let's go to the beginning of that show.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.620]   One of the greatest TV series of all time,
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:14.180]   a dark, fascinating character in Frank Underwood,
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.740]   a ruthless, cunning, borderline evil politician.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:22.220]   What are some interesting aspects to the process
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.060]   you went through becoming Frank Underwood?
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.940]   Maybe Richard III, there's a lot of elements there
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:32.220]   in your performance that maybe inspired that character?
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.100]   - Well-- - Is that fair or no?
[01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:38.620]   - I'll give you one very interesting,
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:45.540]   specific education that I got
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:51.020]   in doing Richard III and closing that show at BAM
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:56.220]   in March of 2012, and two months later
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:57.940]   started shooting House of Cards.
[01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:03.020]   There is something called direct address.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:10.620]   In Shakespeare, you have Hamlet talks to the world,
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:15.580]   but when Shakespeare wrote Richard III,
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.740]   it was the first time he created something
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.140]   called direct address, which is the character
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:26.140]   looks directly at each person close by.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:32.740]   It is a different kind of sharing
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.020]   than when a character's doing a monologue,
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:36.460]   a opening of Henry IV.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:43.140]   And while there are some people who believe
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:45.540]   that direct address was invented in Ferris Bueller,
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.900]   it wasn't, it was Shakespeare who invented it.
[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:53.860]   So I had just had this experience every night
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.700]   in theaters all over the world,
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:01.860]   seeing how people reacted to becoming a co-conspirator,
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:06.180]   because that's what it's about.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.420]   And what I tried to do and what Fincher
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:15.940]   really helped me with in those beginning days
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.300]   was how to look in that camera
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:24.100]   and imagine I was talking to my best friend.
[01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:30.740]   - Because you're sharing the secret of the darkness
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:33.820]   of how this game is played with that best friend.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:35.820]   - Yeah, and there were many times when,
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.420]   I suppose the writers thought I was crazy,
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.660]   where I would see a script and I would see this moment
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.180]   where this direct address would happen.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.500]   I'd say all this stuff and I'd go,
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.740]   when we do a read through of the script, I go,
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.460]   I don't think I need to say any of that.
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.300]   And they were like, what do you mean?
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:55.420]   I said, well, the audience knows all of that.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.700]   All I have to do is look.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.980]   They know exactly what's going on.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:02.020]   I don't need to say a thing.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.620]   So I was often cutting dialogue
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:08.220]   because it just wasn't needed.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.940]   Because that relationship that I'd learned
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.980]   that I'd experienced doing Richard III
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:19.380]   was so extraordinary, where I literally watched people,
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.620]   they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing,
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.180]   and this is so awesome.
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.500]   And then suddenly, wait, he killed the kids.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.340]   He killed those kids in the tower.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.620]   Oh, maybe it's not so.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:33.420]   And you literally would watch them start to reverse
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:36.940]   their having had such a great time with Richard III
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.180]   in the first three acts.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:44.060]   And I thought, this is gonna happen in this show.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.380]   If this intimacy
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:52.020]   can actually land.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:58.260]   And I just think there was some brilliant writing,
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.700]   and we always attempted to do it in one take.
[01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:03.020]   No matter how long something was,
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.460]   we would try to do it in one take,
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:07.900]   the direct addresses, so there was never a cut.
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.220]   When we went out on locations,
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.660]   we started to then find ways to cut it
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.380]   and make it slightly broader.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   - That's interesting, 'cause you're doing a bunch of,
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.580]   with both Richard III and Frank Underwood,
[01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:25.580]   a bunch of dark, borderline evil things.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:28.020]   And then I guess the idea is you're going to be
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:31.060]   losing the audience, and then you win them back over
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.380]   with the addresses.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:37.380]   - That's the remarkable thing, is against their instincts
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:42.580]   and their better sense of what they should and should not do,
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.580]   they still rallied around Frank Underwood.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.500]   - And I saw, even with the documentary,
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.740]   the glimmers of that with Richard III.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:54.500]   I mean, you were seducing the audience.
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.660]   Like, there was such a chemistry
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.700]   between you and the audience on stage.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.700]   Well, in that production, that's absolutely true.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:06.980]   Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird,
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:07.980]   I mean by weird.
[01:36:07.980 --> 01:36:12.780]   It was an early play of Shakespeare's.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:18.300]   And he's basically never offstage.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.140]   I mean, I remember when we did the first run-through,
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.420]   I had no idea what the next scene was
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:24.460]   every time I came offstage.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.420]   I had no idea what was next.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:28.700]   They literally had to drag me from one place to another,
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:30.540]   saying, "Now it's the scene with Hastings.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:31.540]   Now it's the scene."
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:35.460]   But I now understand these wonderful stories
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:40.300]   that you can read in old books about Shakespeare's time,
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:45.300]   that actors grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.580]   and punched him and threw him up against a wall
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.500]   and said, "If you ever write a part like this again,
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.340]   I'm gonna kill you."
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:52.300]   And that's why in later plays,
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:54.980]   he started to have a pageant happen,
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.700]   and then a wedding happened,
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.780]   and the main character was offstage resting
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.740]   because the actor had said, "You can't do this to us.
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.180]   There's no breaks."
[01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:05.180]   And it's true.
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:07.580]   There's very few breaks in Richard III.
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.660]   You're onstage most of the time.
[01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.580]   - The comedic aspect of Richard III and Frank Underwood,
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:15.900]   is that a component that helps bring out
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:20.700]   the full complexity of the darkness
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.020]   that is Frank Underwood?
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.500]   - I certainly can't take credit
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:29.060]   for Shakespeare having written something that is funny,
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:31.420]   or Bill Willimon and his team
[01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.140]   to have written something that is funny.
[01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.780]   It's fundamentally funny.
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:38.820]   It just depends on how I interpret it.
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:44.940]   That's one of the great things, why we love...
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:50.260]   In a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.100]   We can see four Richard III's.
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.540]   We can see two Richard II's.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.900]   That's part of the thrill that we don't own these parts.
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:03.380]   We borrow them, and we interpret them.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:06.780]   And what Ian McKellen might do with a role
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.860]   could be completely different from what I might do
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.220]   because of the way we perceive it.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:16.300]   And also, very often in terms of going for humor,
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:18.340]   it's very often a director will say,
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.140]   "Why don't you say that with a bit of irony?
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.340]   "Why don't you try that with a bit of blah-blah-blah?"
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.380]   - Yeah, there's often a wry smile,
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:30.500]   the line that jumps to me when you're talking about Claire,
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:35.780]   in the early, maybe first episode even,
[01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:40.780]   "I love that woman more than sharks love blood."
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:47.780]   I mean, I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line,
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.140]   but the way you read it had both humor,
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:53.460]   had legitimate affection,
[01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.060]   had all the ambition and narcissism,
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.300]   all of that mixed up together.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.260]   - I also think that one should just acknowledge
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:02.460]   that where he was from,
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:06.960]   there is something that happens when you do an accent.
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.620]   And in fact, sometimes when I would say to Beau
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.680]   or one of the other writers,
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.700]   "This is really good, and I love the idea,"
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.660]   but it rhythmically doesn't help.
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:21.940]   I need at least two more words
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:26.120]   to rhythmically make this work in his accent,
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.540]   because it just doesn't scan.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:31.860]   And that's not iambic pentameter.
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.300]   I'm not talking about that.
[01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.020]   There is that as well in Shakespeare,
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:38.820]   but there was sometimes when it's too many lines,
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:43.060]   it's not enough lines in order for me to make this work
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.580]   for the way he speaks, the way he sounds,
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:49.240]   and what that accent does to emphasis.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.860]   - How much of that character,
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:55.940]   in terms of the musicality of the way he speaks,
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:56.860]   is Bill Clinton?
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.140]   - Not really at all.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:03.180]   I mean, Clinton, you know, look, Bill Clinton,
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.460]   he had a way of talking.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.380]   You know, that he was very slow,
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.280]   and he felt your pain, you know?
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.400]   But Frank Underwood was deeper, more direct,
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:23.600]   and less poetic in the way that Clinton would talk.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.600]   I'll tell you this Clinton story that you'll like.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:33.040]   So we decide to do a performance of "The Iceman Cometh"
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.480]   for the Democratic Party on Broadway,
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.720]   and the president is gonna come.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.040]   He's gonna see this four-and-a-half-hour play,
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.360]   and then we're gonna do this event afterward.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:44.120]   And a couple weeks before we're gonna do this event,
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.240]   someone at the White House calls and says,
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.200]   listen, it's very unusual to get the president
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.200]   for like six-and-a-half hours,
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.920]   so we're suggesting that the president come
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.720]   and see the first act, and then he goes.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.400]   And I knew what was happening.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:03.160]   Now, first of all, Clinton knows this play.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.760]   He knows what this play's about.
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.240]   And I, you know, as gently as I could said,
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:11.400]   well, if the president is thinking
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.480]   of leaving at intermission,
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.080]   then I'm afraid we're gonna have to cancel the event.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   There's just no way that...
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.080]   So anyway, then we're, oh, no, it's fine, it's fine.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.360]   Now, I know what was happening.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.400]   What was happening was that someone had read the play,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.200]   and they were quite concerned, and I'll tell you why.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.920]   Because the play is about this character
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.400]   that I portrayed named Hickey.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.160]   And in the course of the play,
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.840]   as things get more and more revealed,
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.200]   you realize that this man that I'm playing
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200]   has been a philanderer.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:44.160]   He's cheated on his wife quite a lot.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:49.000]   And by the end of the play, he is arrested and taken off
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.720]   because he ended up ending his wife's life
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.880]   because she forgave him too much,
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.320]   and he couldn't live with it.
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.960]   So now imagine this.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:02.440]   There's 2,000 people at the Brooks Acres Theatre
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.580]   watching President Clinton, watching this play.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.480]   And at the end of the night, we take our curtain call.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.720]   They bring out the presidential podium.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.040]   Bill Clinton stands up there, and he says,
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:22.160]   "Well, I suppose we should all thank Kevin
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.400]   "and this extraordinary company of actors
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:30.460]   "for giving us all way too much to think about."
[01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:33.140]   (both laughing)
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:38.260]   And the audience fell over in laughter,
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.840]   and then he gave a great speech.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.560]   And I thought that was a pretty good way to handle that.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:45.160]   - Well, in that way, him and Frank Gunter
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.240]   would share a charisma.
[01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.760]   There's certain presidents that just have politicians
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:50.800]   that just have this charisma.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:53.280]   You can't stop listening to them.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:54.540]   Some of it is the accent,
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:58.340]   but some of it is some other magical thing.
[01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:03.960]   - When I was starting to do research,
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.260]   I wanted to meet with the whip, Kevin McCarthy.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:11.000]   And he wouldn't meet with me
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.100]   'til I called his office back and said,
[01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:16.700]   "Tell him I'm playing a Democrat, not a Republican."
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.960]   And then he met with me.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.040]   - Nice. - And he was helpful.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.440]   He took me to whip meetings.
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.320]   - Politicians.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.760]   So you worked with David Fincher there.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.600]   He was the executive producer,
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.980]   but he also directed the first two episodes.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.000]   - Yeah.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.520]   - High level, what was it like working with him again?
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:45.000]   In which ways do you think he helped guide you
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.140]   in the show to become the great show that it was?
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:55.200]   - I give him a huge amount of the credit,
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.100]   and not just for what he established,
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:07.240]   but the fact that every director after
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.560]   stayed within that world.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.640]   I think that's why the series
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.960]   had a very consistent feeling to it.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.120]   It was like watching a very long movie.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.980]   The style, where the camera went,
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:24.760]   what it did, what it didn't do,
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:27.540]   how we used this, how we used that, how we didn't do this.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:31.360]   There were things that he laid the foundation for
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.360]   that we managed to maintain pretty much
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.640]   until Bo Willimon left the show.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   They got rid of Fincher,
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.600]   and I was sort of the last man standing
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.960]   in terms of fighting again.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.140]   Netflix had never had any creative control at all.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:53.040]   We had complete creative control.
[01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.780]   But over time, they started to get themselves involved
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:00.060]   because, look, this is what happens to networks.
[01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.540]   They'd never made a television show before ever,
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:06.520]   and then four years later, they were the best.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:09.540]   And so then you're gonna get suggestions
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.040]   about casting and about writing
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.480]   and about music and scenes.
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:18.340]   And so there was a considerable amount of pushback
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:21.860]   that I had to do when they started to get involved
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.560]   in ways that I thought was affecting
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:25.520]   the quality of the show.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.060]   - What are those battles like?
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:31.400]   Like, I heard that there was a battle with the execs,
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.280]   like you mentioned early on about your name
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   not being on the billing for "Se7en."
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.120]   I heard that there was battles about the ending of "Se7en,"
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.120]   which was really, well, it was pretty dark.
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:48.060]   So what's that battle like?
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:51.780]   How often does that happen, and how do you win that battle?
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.760]   'Cause it feels like there's a line
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:59.360]   where the networks or the execs are really afraid
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:03.320]   of crossing that line into this strange,
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.360]   uncomfortable place, and then the director,
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.880]   great directors and great actors
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.680]   kind of flirt with that line.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.040]   - It can happen in different ways.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:17.120]   I mean, I remember one argument we had was
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.480]   we had specifically shot a scene
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:23.080]   so that there would be no score in that scene,
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.680]   so that there was no music, it was just two people talking.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.860]   And then we end up seeing a cut
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:33.200]   where they've decided to put music in,
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.140]   and it is against everything
[01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:37.200]   that scene's supposed to be about.
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.160]   And you have to go and say, "Guys, this was intentional.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.240]   "We did not want score, and now you've added score
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:44.380]   "because what, you think it's too quiet?
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:47.560]   "You think our audience can't listen to two people talk
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:49.020]   "for two and a half minutes?
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.460]   "This show has proved anything.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:52.600]   "It's proved that people have patience
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.360]   "and they're willing to watch an entire season
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.400]   "over a weekend."
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:00.360]   So there are those kind of arguments that can happen.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:06.880]   There are different arguments on different levels,
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.840]   and they sometimes have to do with,
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.400]   I mean, look, go back to "The Godfather."
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.880]   They wanted to fire Pacino
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.980]   'cause they didn't see anything happening.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:18.880]   They saw nothing happening, so they wanted to fire Pacino.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.740]   And then finally Coppola thought,
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.900]   "I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner
[01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.580]   "and they'll do that scene now."
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.840]   And that was the first scene where they went,
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.580]   "Yeah, actually, there's something going on there."
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:32.440]   So Pacino kept the role.
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.580]   - You think that "Godfather" is when Pacino was,
[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:38.860]   like, the Pacino we know was born?
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.020]   Or is that more like, there's the character
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:44.460]   that really over the top, in "Scent of a Woman."
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:46.300]   There's like stages, I suppose.
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.200]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:50.060]   Look, I think that we can't forget
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:52.560]   that Pacino is also an animal of the theater.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.260]   He does a lot of plays, and he started off doing plays,
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:01.260]   and movies were, "Panic in Needle Park" was his first.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:05.000]   And yeah, I think there's that period of time
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.620]   when he was doing some incredible parts, incredible movies.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:12.580]   When I did a series called "Wise Guy,"
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.620]   I got cast on a Thursday,
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:16.980]   and I flew up to Vancouver on a Saturday.
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:18.320]   I started shooting on Monday.
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:19.940]   And all I had time to do was watch
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:21.740]   "The Godfather" and "Surfaco."
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:25.180]   And then I went to work. (laughs)
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:26.740]   - Would you say, ridiculous question,
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.780]   "Godfather," greatest film of all time?
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:32.740]   - Well, certainly. - Gun to your head,
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:34.680]   right now. - Certainly, yes, yes.
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.340]   But I also, look, I'm allowed to change my opinion.
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.340]   I can next week say it's "Lawrence of Arabia,"
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:45.940]   or a week after that, I can say, "Sullivan's Travels."
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.900]   I mean, that's the wonderful thing about movies,
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:50.100]   and particularly great movies,
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:51.660]   is when you see them again,
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.660]   it's like seeing them for the first time.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:57.740]   And you pick up things that you didn't see the last time.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.900]   - And for that day, you fall in love with that movie.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:03.260]   You might even say to a friend
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:04.980]   that that is the greatest movie of all time.
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:07.740]   - And also, I think it's the degree
[01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:10.820]   with which directors are daring.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:15.820]   I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.440]   to play three major roles in "Dr. Strangelove."
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:25.300]   I mean, who has the balls to do that today?
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.420]   - I was gonna mention, when we're talking about "Seven,"
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:33.220]   that just, if you're looking at the greatest performances,
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:35.900]   portrayals of murderers,
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:37.820]   so obviously, like I mentioned,
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:39.940]   Hannibal Lecter in "Silence of the Lambs,"
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:40.760]   that's up there.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:43.400]   "Seven," to me, is like competing for first place
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:45.340]   with "Silence of the Lambs."
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:46.940]   But then there's a different one
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:52.980]   with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, right, with "The Shining."
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:57.380]   And there's, as opposed to a murderer
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.180]   who's always been a murderer,
[01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:02.100]   here's a person, like in "American Beauty,"
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:06.700]   who becomes that, who descends into madness.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.100]   I read also that Jack Nicholson improvised
[01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:10.860]   "Here's Johnny" in that scene.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:11.840]   - I believe that.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.400]   - That's a very different performance than yours in "Seven."
[01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.920]   What do you make of that performance?
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.160]   - Nicholson's always been such an incredible actor
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.160]   because he has absolutely no shame
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.520]   about being demonstrative and over-the-top,
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:32.160]   and he also has no problem playing characters
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.680]   who are deeply flawed, and he's interested in that.
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:37.320]   I have a pretty good Nicholson story, though.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.920]   Nobody knows.
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.400]   - You also have a pretty good Nicholson impression,
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.840]   but what's the story?
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.920]   - Story is, the story was told to me
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.960]   by a sound man, Dennis Maitland,
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:50.560]   who's a great, great, great guy.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.440]   He said he was very excited
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.040]   because he got on "Pritzy's Honor,"
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:58.120]   which was Jack Nicholson and Angelica Houston
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.620]   directed by John Houston.
[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.640]   He said, "I was so excited.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.400]   "It's my first day on the movie,
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.700]   "and I get told to go into Mr. Nicholson's trailer
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.960]   "and mic him up for the first scene.
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:10.660]   "So I knock on the trailer door,
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:15.160]   "and I hear, 'Yes, come on in!'
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.440]   "I come inside, and Mr. Nicholson is changing
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.320]   "out of his regular clothes,
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.300]   "and he's gonna put on his costume,
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.060]   "and so I'm setting up the mic, and I'm getting ready,
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:29.400]   "and I said, 'Mr. Nicholson, I just wanted to tell you,
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:32.160]   "'I'm extremely excited to be working with you again.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:33.440]   "'It's a great pleasure.'
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:36.320]   "And Jack goes, 'Did we work together before?'
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.920]   "And he says, 'Yes, yes, we did.'
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.860]   "And he goes, 'What film did we do together?'
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.720]   "He says, 'Well, we did Missouri Breaks.'
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:47.880]   "Nicholson goes, 'Oh, my God, Missouri Breaks.
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:50.800]   "'Jesus Christ, we were out of our minds on that film.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.080]   "'Holy shit, Jesus Christ, I wonder I'm alive.
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:56.520]   "'My God, there was so much drugs going on,
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.660]   "'and we were stoned out of our minds.
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.000]   "'Holy shit.'
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.640]   "And just then, he folds the pants
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.780]   "that he's just taken off over his arm,
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.100]   "and an eighth of Coke drops out on the floor."
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:09.340]   (laughing)
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:14.560]   Dennis looks at it, Nicholson looks at it.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:20.480]   Jack goes, "Haven't worn these pants since Missouri Breaks."
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:22.900]   (laughing)
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:25.860]   - Man, I love that guy, unapologetically himself.
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.140]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:31.980]   - Your impression of him at the AFI was just great.
[01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:35.420]   - Well, that was for Mike Nichols.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.500]   - Oh, yeah, he had a big impact on your career.
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.440]   - Huge impact on my career. - He's really important.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.280]   Can you talk about him?
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.060]   Like, what role did he play in your life?
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:47.780]   - I think it was, yeah, it was 1984.
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:50.940]   I went in to audition for the national tour
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.140]   of a play called "The Real Thing,"
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:55.880]   which Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close were doing on Broadway
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.200]   that Mr. Nichols had directed.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.540]   So I went in to read for this character,
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:01.900]   Brody, who is a Scottish character.
[01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:06.340]   And I did the audition, and Mike Nichols comes down
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:09.740]   the aisle of the theater, and he's asking me questions
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:11.820]   about where'd you go to school, and what have you been doing?
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:14.540]   I'd just come back from doing a bunch of years
[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:16.100]   of regional theater and different theaters,
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.780]   so I was in New York, and meeting Mike Nichols
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.700]   was just incredible.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:24.920]   So Mr. Nichols went, "Have you seen the other play
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.780]   "that I directed up the block called 'Hurley Burley'?"
[01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:28.860]   And I said, "No, I haven't."
[01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:30.820]   He says, "Why not?"
[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:33.220]   I said, "I can't afford a Broadway ticket."
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.680]   He said, "We can arrange that.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.140]   "I'd like you to go see that play,
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:37.540]   "and then I'd like you to come in next week
[01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.620]   "and audition for that."
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.700]   I was like, "Oh, okay."
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.380]   So I went to see "Hurley Burley."
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:49.260]   William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken,
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:54.260]   Candice Bergen, Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller.
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:57.900]   And I watched this play, it's a play,
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:00.160]   David Ray play about Hollywood.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.220]   This is crazy.
[01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:05.780]   I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable,
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:07.020]   and it was extraordinary.
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:08.660]   Chris Walken, this guy's weird.
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:12.260]   So Harvey Keitel, Walken came in later.
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:14.420]   Harvey Keitel's playing this part.
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:16.260]   And I come in, and I audition for it,
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:19.540]   and Nichols says, "I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:21.980]   "I want you to understudy Phil."
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.060]   And I'm like, "Phil?"
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.540]   I mean, Harvey Keitel is like in his 40s.
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.340]   He looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.180]   on stage.
[01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.580]   He's like 24-year-old.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:35.500]   And Nichols said, "It's all about attitude.
[01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.700]   "If you believe you can beat the shit
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.300]   "out of everybody on stage, the audience will too."
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.280]   So I then started to learn Phil.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.940]   And the way it works when you're in understudy,
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.460]   unless you're a name,
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.900]   they don't let you rehearse on the stage.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:53.980]   You just rehearse in a rehearsal room.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:56.560]   But I used to sneak onto the stage and rehearse
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.900]   and try to figure out where the props were and yadda yadda.
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.220]   Anyway, one day I get a call.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:04.220]   "You're going on today as Phil."
[01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:07.140]   So I went on.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:10.660]   Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence,
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:13.380]   who's the stage manager, "Spacey's going on as Phil."
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.060]   So Nichols comes down and watches the second act,
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.140]   comes backstage.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:20.700]   He says, "That was really good.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:23.360]   "How soon could you learn Mickey?"
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.820]   Mickey was the role that Ron Silver was playing,
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.920]   that Chris Walken also played.
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:35.380]   I said, "I don't know, maybe a couple of weeks."
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.100]   He goes, "Learn Mickey too."
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:40.260]   So I learned Mickey.
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:43.500]   And then one day I'm told,
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.660]   "You're going on tomorrow night as Mickey."
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:49.420]   Nichols comes, sees the second act,
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:53.500]   comes backstage and says, "That was really good.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.740]   "I mean, that was really funny.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.400]   "How soon could you learn Eddie?"
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.200]   (chuckles)
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.000]   And so I became like the pinch hitter on "Hurley Burley."
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.200]   I learned all the male parts, including Jerry Stiller's,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.700]   although I never went on as Jerry Stiller's part.
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.940]   And then I left the play.
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.960]   I guess about two months later,
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.240]   I get this phone call from Mike Nichols.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:19.280]   He's like, "Kevin, how are you?"
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.680]   And I'm like, "I'm fine.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.360]   "What can I do for you?"
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:25.000]   He says, "Well, I'm gonna make a film this summer
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.520]   "with Mandy and Meryl,
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.720]   "and there's a role I'd like you to come in
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:31.760]   "and audition for."
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.040]   So I went in, auditioned,
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:38.600]   cast me as this mugger on a subway.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:41.040]   Then there's this whole upheaval that happens
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.120]   because he then doesn't continue with Mandy Potemkin.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.560]   Mandy leaves the movie,
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.960]   and he asked Jack Nicholson to come in
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.680]   and replace Mandy Potemkin.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:54.920]   So now I had no scenes with him,
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.920]   but I'm in a movie with Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep,
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:00.840]   and my first scene in this movie,
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.960]   which I shot on my birthday, July 26th of '85,
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.680]   I got to wink at Meryl Streep in this scene,
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.960]   and I was so nervous.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:12.720]   I literally couldn't wink.
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.160]   Nichols had to calm me down and help me wink,
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:21.200]   but that became my very first film.
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:25.880]   And he was incredible, and he let me come and watch
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.040]   when they were shooting scenes I wasn't in.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.920]   And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.600]   on the same day we were working, Jack and me.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.200]   We had no scene together.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.360]   But I remember him coming in,
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.720]   and they put him down in the chair,
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.920]   and they put cucumbers, frozen cucumbers on his eyes,
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.080]   and did his neck.
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:45.960]   And then they raised him up and did his face,
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:47.640]   and then I remember Nicholson went like this,
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.200]   looked in the mirror, and he went.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.960]   (sighing)
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:57.600]   Another day, another $50,000.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:58.920]   (laughing)
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.120]   And walked out of the trailer.
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.520]   - Well, what was Christopher Walken like?
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.960]   - Ah.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:07.120]   - So he's a theater guy too.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.960]   - Oh yeah, he started out as a chorus boy, dancer.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.360]   - Well, I can see that.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:14.920]   - The guy knows how to move.
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.040]   - I've known Walken a long time,
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.920]   and I did a Saturday Night Live where I did,
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.560]   we did these Star Wars auditions.
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:23.320]   (laughing)
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:25.320]   I did Chris Walken as Han Solo.
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.160]   - So good.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:29.080]   - And I'll never forget this.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.720]   I was in Los Angeles about two weeks after,
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.200]   and I was at Chateau Marmont.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:34.880]   There was some party happening at Chateau Marmont,
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.720]   and I saw Chris Walken come out onto the balcony,
[01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.120]   and I was like, "Oh shit, it's Chris Walken."
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.680]   And he walked up to me and he went,
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:47.520]   "Kevin, I saw your little sketch.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:49.480]   "It was funny, ha-ha."
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:51.720]   (laughing)
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:55.600]   - Oh man, it was a really good sketch.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.600]   And that guy, there's certain people that are truly unique
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:07.120]   and unapologetic, continue being that
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.200]   throughout their whole career.
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.720]   The way they talk, the musicality of how they talk,
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.560]   how they are, their way of being, he's that.
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:14.400]   - Yeah.
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.840]   - And it somehow works.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.680]   - His watch.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:18.520]   (laughing)
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.360]   - Yeah.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:23.240]   - I mean, it works in so many different contexts.
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:26.320]   He plays like a mobster in "True Romance,"
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.600]   and it's like genius, that's genius.
[01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.920]   But he could be anything.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.720]   He could be soft, he could be a badass, all of it.
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.020]   And he's always Christopher Walken,
[01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:37.680]   but somehow works for all these different characters.
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.400]   So I guess we were talking about "House of Cards"
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:45.840]   two hours ago before we took a tangent upon a tangent,
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.240]   but there's a moment in episode one
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:53.080]   where President Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:56.080]   that he would make him a Secretary of State.
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:59.560]   Was this when the monster in Frank was born,
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:01.560]   or was the monster always there?
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.980]   The sort of, for you looking at that character,
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:08.600]   was there an idealistic notion to him
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.260]   that there's loyalty and that broke him,
[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:13.680]   or did he always know that there is,
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:16.160]   this whole world is about manipulation
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:19.000]   and do anything to get power?
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000]   - Well, I mean, it might've been the first moment
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.480]   an audience saw him be betrayed,
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.280]   but it certainly was not the first betrayal
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.480]   he'd experienced.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.840]   And once you start to get to know him
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:32.160]   and learn about his life and learn about his father
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:34.000]   and learn about his friends
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.360]   and learn about their relationship
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:40.040]   and learn what he was like even as a cadet,
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.840]   I think you start to realize that this is a man
[02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   who has very strong beliefs about loyalty.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:53.120]   And so it wasn't the first,
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.920]   it was just the first moment that,
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:58.480]   in terms of the storyline that's being built,
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.240]   Knight Takes King was the name of our production company.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:06.200]   - Yeah, what do you think motivated him
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.040]   at that moment and throughout the show?
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.880]   Was it all about power and also legacy,
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.360]   or was there some small part underneath it all
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:21.360]   where he wanted to actually do good in the world?
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.720]   - No, I think power is a afterthought.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.240]   What he loved more than anything
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:33.720]   was being able to predict how human beings would react.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.700]   He was a behavioral psychologist.
[02:01:39.440 --> 02:01:42.040]   And he could know,
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:46.120]   like he was 17 moves ahead in a chess game,
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:49.760]   he could know if he did this at this moment
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.280]   that eventually this would happen.
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:58.160]   He was able to be predictive and was usually right.
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.920]   He knew just how far he needed to push someone
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:06.200]   to get them to do what he needed them to do
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.440]   in order to make the next step work.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:13.720]   - You've played a bunch of evil characters.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:15.080]   - Well, you call them evil.
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:18.480]   But you don't, but the reason I say that,
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:19.760]   and I don't mean to be snarky about it,
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.000]   but the reason I say it that way
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.440]   is because I never judge the people I play.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:28.760]   And the people that I have played
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.120]   or that any actor has played
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:35.120]   don't necessarily view themselves as this label.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.160]   It's easy to say, but that's not the way I can think.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:46.280]   I cannot judge a character I play and then play them well.
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:51.160]   I have to be free of judgment.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.000]   I have to just play them
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.040]   and let the cards drop where they may,
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:57.820]   and let an audience judge.
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.920]   I mean, the fact that you use that word is perfectly fine.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:03.760]   That's your, you know, but it's like people asking me,
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.760]   you know, was I really from K-Pax or not?
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.000]   You know, it's just entirely depends on your perspective.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.320]   - Do roles like that, like Seven, like Frank Underwood,
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:22.080]   like Lester from American Beauty,
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.760]   do they change you psychologically as a person?
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.460]   So walking around in the skin of these characters,
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.080]   these complex characters
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.200]   with very different moral systems?
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:47.040]   - I absolutely believe that wandering around
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:51.380]   in someone else's ideas, in someone else's clothes,
[02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:57.540]   in someone else's shoes teaches you enormous empathy.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.200]   And that goes to the heart of not judging.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:09.320]   And I have found that I have been so moved by,
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.200]   I mean, look, let's,
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.200]   yes, you've identified the darker characters,
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.660]   but I played Clarence Darrow three times.
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:21.040]   I've played a play called "National Anthems."
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.400]   I've done movies like "Recount."
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.080]   I've done films like "The Ref."
[02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:28.420]   I've done films that in which there are,
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.820]   that doesn't exist in any of those characters.
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:32.140]   - Paid forward. - Those qualities.
[02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:32.980]   Paid forward.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:40.740]   And so it is incredible to be able
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:45.780]   to embrace those things that I admire
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:47.900]   and that are like me,
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:51.460]   and those things that I don't admire and aren't like me.
[02:04:51.460 --> 02:04:55.020]   But I have to put them on an equal footing
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:58.900]   and say I have to just play them as best I can
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:04.820]   and not decide to wield judgment over them.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:09.020]   - Without judgment. - Without judgment.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.180]   - In "Gulag Archipelago,"
[02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:15.580]   Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously writes about the line
[02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:16.420]   between good and evil
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:19.100]   and that it runs through the heart of every man.
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:23.940]   So the full paragraph there,
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:25.580]   when he talks about the line,
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:28.820]   "During the life of any heart,
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:30.620]   this line keeps changing place.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:33.820]   Sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil,
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:36.620]   and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:38.420]   for good to flourish.
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.220]   One in the same human being is, at various ages,
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:43.940]   under various circumstances,
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:46.220]   a totally different human being.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:49.420]   At times, he is close to being a devil,
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:51.700]   at times, to sainthood.
[02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:53.420]   But his name doesn't change,
[02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:58.300]   and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil."
[02:05:58.300 --> 02:05:59.940]   What do you think about this note
[02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:04.500]   that we're all capable of good and evil,
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:07.780]   and throughout life, that line moves and shifts
[02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:09.860]   throughout the day, throughout every hour?
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:15.340]   - Yeah, I mean, one of the things
[02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:20.340]   that I've been focused on very succinctly
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:23.460]   is the idea that every day is an opportunity.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:30.540]   It's an opportunity to make better decisions,
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:36.900]   to learn, and to grow.
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:42.900]   And I also think that, look,
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:47.820]   I grew up not knowing if my parents loved me,
[02:06:50.260 --> 02:06:51.660]   particularly my father.
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:59.580]   I never had a sense that I was loved,
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:02.500]   and that stayed with me my whole life.
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:10.220]   And when I think back at who my father was,
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:16.100]   and more succinctly, who he became,
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:24.460]   it was a gradual and slow and sad development.
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:34.380]   When I've gone back, and now I've looked at diaries
[02:07:34.380 --> 02:07:37.020]   my father kept and albums he kept,
[02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:41.240]   particularly when he was a medic in the US Army,
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:45.200]   served our country with distinction.
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:50.820]   When the war was over and they went to Germany,
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:54.500]   the things my father said, the things that he wrote,
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.700]   the things that he believed were as patriotic
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:59.400]   as any American soldier who had ever served.
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:04.340]   But then when he came back to America,
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:07.620]   and he had a dream of being a journalist,
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:11.880]   or his big hope was that he was gonna be
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:13.660]   the great American novelist.
[02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:16.140]   He wanted to be a creative novelist,
[02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:21.140]   and so he sat in his office and he wrote for 45 years,
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.940]   and never published anything.
[02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:29.940]   And somewhere along the way, in order to make money,
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:34.940]   he became what they call a technical procedure writer,
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:38.540]   which the best way to describe that
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:42.600]   is that if you built the F-16 aircraft,
[02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:44.140]   my father would have written the manual
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:45.380]   to tell you how to do it.
[02:08:46.260 --> 02:08:48.520]   I mean, as boring, as technical,
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.200]   as tedious as you can imagine.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:57.140]   And so somewhere in the '60s and into the '70s,
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:01.420]   my father fell in with groups of people
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:04.120]   and individuals, pretend intellectuals,
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:09.880]   who started to give him reasons why he was not successful
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.560]   as a white Aryan man in the United States.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:19.560]   And over time, my father became a white supremacist.
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:30.580]   And I cannot tell you the amount of times,
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:35.580]   as a young boy, that my father would sit me down
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:40.680]   and lecture me for hours and hours and hours
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:47.340]   about his fucked up ideas of America,
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:51.840]   of prejudice, of white supremacy.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.340]   And thank God for my sister, who said,
[02:09:55.340 --> 02:09:58.140]   "Don't listen to a thing he says, he's out of his mind."
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:03.800]   And even though I was young, I knew everything he was saying
[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:06.520]   was against people and I loved people.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.060]   I had so many wonderful friends.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:18.320]   My best friend, Mike, who's still my close friend
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:23.320]   to this day, I was afraid to bring him to my house
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.060]   because I was afraid that my father would find out
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:30.640]   he was Jewish or that my father would leave
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.080]   his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.900]   or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:38.360]   or what he might say.
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:44.360]   So, when I found theater in the eighth grade
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:56.160]   and debate club and choir and festivals and plays
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:02.200]   and everything I could do to participate in
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:04.480]   that wouldn't make me have to come back home,
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:11.360]   I did and I had to reconcile who he became
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:24.900]   because the gap between that man who was in the US Army
[02:11:24.900 --> 02:11:28.120]   as a medic and the man he became,
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.100]   I could never fill that gap.
[02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:37.800]   But, I've forgiven him.
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:43.960]   But then at the same time, I've had to look at my mother
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:47.700]   and say, "She made excuses for him.
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:50.600]   "Oh, he just needs to get it off his chest.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:52.700]   "Oh, it doesn't matter, just let him say."
[02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:57.980]   So, while on the outside, I would say,
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:02.580]   "Oh yeah, my mother loved me, but she didn't protect me.
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:08.580]   "So, was all the stuff that she expressed
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:16.360]   "and all of the attention and all the love that I felt,
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.400]   "was that because I became successful
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:22.200]   "and I was able to fulfill an emptiness
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.200]   "that she'd lived with her whole life with him?"
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.780]   I don't know, but I've had to ask myself,
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:35.240]   those questions over these last years
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:39.380]   to try to reconcile that for myself.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:43.700]   - And the thing you wanted from them and for them
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:46.400]   is less hate and more love.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:50.560]   Did your dad say he loves you?
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:52.580]   - I don't have any memory of that.
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:56.800]   I was in a program and they were showing us
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.520]   an experiment that they'd done with psychologists
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:04.560]   and mothers and fathers and their children.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:07.400]   And the children were anywhere between six months and a year
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:08.780]   sitting in a little crib.
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:11.680]   And the exercise was this,
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.800]   parents are playing with the baby right there,
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:15.840]   toys, yadda yadda, baby's laughing.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.780]   And then the psychologists would say, "Stop."
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.480]   And the parent would go like this.
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:25.960]   And you would then watch for the next two and a half,
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.720]   three minutes, this child trying to get
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:34.720]   their parents' attention in any possible way.
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:37.480]   And I remember when I was sitting in this theater
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:42.480]   watching this, I saw myself.
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:47.520]   That was me screaming and reaching out
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.160]   and trying to get my parents' attention.
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.520]   That was me.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:55.520]   And that was not something I'd ever remembered before.
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:59.620]   But I knew what that baby was going through.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:05.280]   - Is there some elements of politics
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.720]   and maybe the private sector
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:12.880]   that are captured by the house of cards?
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:15.940]   Like how true to life do you think that is?
[02:14:15.940 --> 02:14:18.680]   From everything you've seen about politics,
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:23.680]   from everything you've seen about the politicians
[02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:26.200]   of this particular elections.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.160]   - I heard so many different reactions
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:32.120]   from politicians about house of cards.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:35.820]   Some would say, "Oh, it's not like that at all."
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:38.440]   And then others would say, "It's closer to the truth
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.800]   "than anyone wants to admit."
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:44.720]   And I think I fall down on the side of that idea.
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:51.120]   - I have to interview some world leaders,
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.020]   some big politicians.
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:15:02.220]   In your understanding of trying to become Frank Underwood,
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:05.580]   what advice would you give in interviewing Frank Underwood?
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:08.260]   (laughing)
[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:12.580]   How do you get him to say anything that's at all honest?
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:14.140]   - Well, in Frank's case, all you have to do
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:16.680]   is tell him to look into the camera and he'll tell you.
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.520]   He'll tell you what you want to hear.
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.760]   - That's the secret.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:20.720]   Unfortunately, we don't get that look
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:23.780]   into the mind of a person the way we do
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:26.700]   with Frank Underwood in real life, sadly.
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:29.340]   - Well, but you could say to somebody,
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.700]   "You like the series House of Cards.
[02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.600]   "I'd love for you to just look into the camera
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.840]   "and tell us what's really going on,
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:39.600]   "what you really feel about blah, blah, blah."
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.280]   - That's a good technique.
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:44.080]   I'll try that with Zelensky and with Putin.
[02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:49.460]   - What do you hope your legacy as an actor is
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:51.200]   and as a human being?
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.680]   - People ask me now,
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.380]   what's your favorite performance you've ever given?
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:02.560]   And my answer is, I haven't given it yet.
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:09.340]   So, there's a lot more that I wanna be challenged by,
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:13.500]   be inspired by.
[02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:19.340]   There's a lot that I don't know.
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:23.860]   There's a lot I have to learn.
[02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:31.860]   And that is a very exciting place to feel that I'm in.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:37.860]   It's been interesting 'cause we're going back,
[02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:42.860]   we're talking, and it's nice to go back every now and then.
[02:16:43.860 --> 02:16:48.260]   But I'm focused on what's next.
[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:51.840]   - Do you hope the world forgives you?
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:17:01.660]   - People go to church every week to be forgiven.
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:07.000]   And I believe that forgiveness and I believe that redemption
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.540]   are beautiful things.
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.120]   I mean, look, don't forget,
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:14.220]   I live in an industry in which there is
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:18.380]   a tremendous amount of conversation about redemption
[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:21.180]   from a lot of people who are very serious people
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:24.940]   in very serious positions, who believe in it.
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:28.340]   I mean, that guy who finally got out of prison,
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.980]   he was wrongly accused.
[02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:33.540]   That guy who served his time and got out of prison.
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:36.940]   We see so many people saying,
[02:17:36.940 --> 02:17:39.420]   let's find a path for that person.
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:41.740]   Let's help that person rejoin society.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:46.960]   But there is an odd situation
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:49.300]   if you're in the entertainment industry,
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:51.500]   you're not offered that kind of a path.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:57.980]   And I hope that the fear that people are experiencing
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:18:02.060]   will eventually subside and common sense
[02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:03.540]   will get back to the table.
[02:18:03.540 --> 02:18:07.940]   - If it does, do you think you have
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:09.940]   another Oscar-worthy performance in you?
[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:13.700]   - Listen, if it would piss off Jack Lemmon again
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:16.580]   for me to win a third time, I absolutely think so, yeah.
[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:20.040]   - Well, you have to mention him again.
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:22.020]   You know, Ernest Hemingway once said
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:25.140]   that the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:28.120]   And I agree with him on both counts.
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.860]   Kevin, thank you so much for talking today.
[02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:31.700]   - Thank you.
[02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:34.380]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:35.660]   with Kevin Spacey.
[02:18:35.660 --> 02:18:36.900]   To support this podcast,

[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:43.660]   And now let me leave you with some words from Meryl Streep.
[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:46.500]   Acting is not about being someone different.
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:51.380]   It's finding the similarity in what is apparently different
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:54.700]   and then finding myself in there.
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:59.260]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:04.420]   (upbeat music)
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:06.480]   you
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:16.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
