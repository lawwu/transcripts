[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You respond to the market crash

[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   with regard to your investment portfolio,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   then you follow that strategy
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   that you have created during times
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   that were not emotional,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   during times that were not filled with fear or euphoria,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and you follow that strategy

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   during times that are difficult.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I've told this story many times,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   but I want to repeat it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Years ago, I had an interesting experience
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   where I had a client of mine
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   who ran a drywall company.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The time that I met him, it was 2010,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and he had been in the construction industry
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   in South Florida.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   The construction industry in South Florida
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   had utterly collapsed in 2008, 2009, 2010,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and he had no business.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   What was interesting, I came along
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   as a financial planner at the time,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   wanting him to work with me.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It turned out that I didn't have very much
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   to offer him, but he had a whole lot to offer me.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   His comment to me was, he said,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "Joshua, this has been," I forget,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   "my third or fourth recession,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   "and I've learned a little bit along the way
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "of how to respond to recessions."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And so what he had done in his business
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   was he had parked all of his trucks,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   he had laid off all of his employees,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   he had one part-time administrative staff member
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   who was answering the phones when they rang,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and he had pulled everything back
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   to the bare minimum, and he was going fishing every day.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And he didn't borrow any money from anybody,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   he was completely debt-free,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   he had no overhead, and he had plenty of cash reserves,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and so he went fishing every day.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He said, "I've learned over the years
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "that it's easier to make money
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   "when you just simply follow the markets,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   "and it's easier to take a vacation
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   "rather than worrying about how do I make money
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   "in a dead market?"
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And he'd actually bought a brand-new fishing boat
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   from some guy who was in over his head
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and he bought a $100,000 boat for 40 grand
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   or something like that,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I don't remember the exact numbers,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   and he was going fishing and enjoying his lifestyle.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And over the years, I've thought of him
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   again and again and again,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   and I've realized that life is easier
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   when you don't fight against the tides.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   If you've ever gone out and rowed a boat,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   rowed a canoe or something like that,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   and figured out that if you have to fight
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   against the current or fight against the tides,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   it's really difficult.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But if you simply time your life
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   in accordance with the tides,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   then things can work really, really well.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   How does this relate to internationalskateplan.com?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   There are times in your life
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   at which it might be better for you
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   to just leave the country.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Now, I talk a lot about doing that
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   in times of emergency, right?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Maybe you are facing hyperinflation
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   like they're facing in Argentina or Turkey right now,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and you decide, "You know what?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   "I'm gonna get out for a while,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "and I'm gonna go somewhere else
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "where I don't have to deal with this hyperinflation."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Maybe, though, it's just simply business is dead
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and, "You know what?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   "I'd like to go ahead and just take it easy for a year."
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Well, now, all of a sudden,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   renting out your house
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   so that you cover your mortgage payment
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   and going to a cheap country
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   that you had already decided that you liked
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   might be useful.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Internationalskateplan.com is much more intended
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   to help you prepare for an acute situation
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   when you have to leave
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   because the cops knocked on your door and said,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   "Were you in this place at a certain time?"
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and you're not so sure
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   if you really want to answer that
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   or whether you want to have your lawyer answer that
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   while you are on the other side of the world.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Or you're just not sure about
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   whether it's safe to be in your country right now
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   and you might want to be in a country
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   that's safer for a period of time.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But if you would like to have
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   an international skate plan
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and you would like to know how to build it
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   in a simple, sensible, non-freak-out, non-dumb way
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   where you don't overcommit to something
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and you just systematically build up your ability
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   to live freely
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   if things don't go great in your home country,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   go to internationalskateplan.com
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and sign up for that course.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I promise, well worth the money.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So let's go back to markets.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   How do you respond to a market crash?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I gave you the answer, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   You respond according to your pre-existing strategy.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And again, my goal is not to embarrass you by saying that
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   but to say that if you're not responding
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   according to your pre-existing strategy,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   therein lies your major mistake.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Market crashes in every market everywhere are inevitable.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That's what markets do.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Now of course that word crash is very subjective.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   What does it mean?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Does it mean a 5% change in markets up and down?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Does it mean a 25%?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's not a defined term.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We have good technical definitions
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   that we use for bear markets and bull markets.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We have good technical definitions
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   that we use for recessions and depressions.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But crash is just one of those evocative, scary words
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   that doesn't actually give you any ability to respond.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So I'm using it to evoke the emotion
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   without getting into the details
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   because the details don't matter.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   The point is before you ever invest money,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   you should have some kind of plan
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and some kind of system.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So where's your starting point?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Well, the starting point is to say,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   "Am I a long-term buy and hold investor
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   or do I have a trading strategy of some kind?"
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I think the best, most sensible way
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   for people to invest their money
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   is to be a long-term buy and hold investor.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Now that applies whether you're investing
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   into mutual funds or stocks in your retirement account.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That applies whether you're investing into real estate.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That applies whether you're investing into Bitcoin.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   All of these can work well
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   for a long-term buy and hold investor.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   How do you know if you're a long-term buy and hold investor?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Well, the way you know that is you look
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   at the investment asset that you're buying
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and you ask yourself,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   "Do I believe that this investment asset
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   is a quality asset for me to hold for a long time?"
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you should know that somewhat intuitively.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   If I point across the street
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   and I show you a good, solid three- or four-bedroom house,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   two or three bathrooms, couple cars,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   couple car garage on a nice residential street
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   with good, big, mature trees,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   you know it's safe,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   you see some children playing here and there,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   you see some nice cars parked in the driveway,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and I ask you,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   "Do you think this is a good asset for you to own?"
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   The answer should be fairly obvious,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   fairly intuitive.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You look at it and say,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "Yeah, I think this is a good asset for me to own."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Why?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Why do you think that's a good asset for you to own?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Well, the answer is it's always the kind of asset
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   that's going to be in demand.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If you look and you can see a nice house
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   that you yourself would be willing to live in,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   then it's easy to imagine
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   that other people would also want to live in that house.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's obvious that,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   "Hey, you know what?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   "If I would live in that house,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "somebody else would probably live in that house,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   "and people need a place to live."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now, compare that to my taking you outside of town,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   wrong side of the railroad tracks,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   old, run-down, broken-down house,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and I say to you,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   "Is this a good investment?"
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Well, you would look at that and you would say,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   "I'm not so sure if it is.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "Maybe it could be made a good investment.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "There might be some speculation available.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   "Maybe I could buy that old house,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "and I could fix it up,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   "and I could rent it to somebody
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   "who doesn't mind living on the wrong side of town.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   "Maybe something's going to change
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   "that's going to make this the right side of town.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   "You know, there's going to put in a new highway,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "or there's going to put in a new housing development,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   "or something's going to happen.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   "They're going to get rid of the railroad tracks,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "and now this dividing line is no longer there."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's a speculation.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   That's a trade.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That's where you're looking at it and you're saying,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "I could own it until."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   This is the basic difference that I see,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   just put in very simple terms,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   between somebody who's a long-term buy-and-hold investor
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   versus somebody who wants to trade it.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   If you look at an asset that you own,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and you say, "I think this is a good, high-quality asset,"
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   then chances are that if you buy it,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   things are probably going to work out.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Think about that house.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Think about all of the market crashes
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   that you've lived through in real estate.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   If you bought that house,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   it's a good-quality house in a good part of town,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   on a good, safe street, with trees growing up, etc.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   If you bought that house,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   can you think of any time
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   at which you would have lost your shirt on that investment
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   if you held it for a few years?
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's hard to think of any.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Even in the most vicious real estate markets,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   declines, etc.,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   generally speaking,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   if you can have at least a few years
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   to hold on to a piece of property,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   you can always sell it and get your money out.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Wait a few more years, you can usually sell it
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and get a bigger profit.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Usually, that house is in high demand.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Now, the same thing doesn't occur
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   with that more speculative house,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   the more run-down, ramshackle house.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   With there, your speculation,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   "Eh, I'm not so sure. Maybe this part of town is really dead.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Maybe this city is really dead and falling apart.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Maybe the country is really dead and falling apart."
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   But if you buy quality houses
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   in virtually any town,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   really in virtually any country,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   good chance they're okay, they're quality.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Now, what about the businesses that you own?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Because that's fundamentally what you own
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   if you own stocks or if you own shares of,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   portions of stock within your mutual fund.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   What about those businesses?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   If I bring you to a high-quality,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   old, well-run business in your town,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   and I say, "Hey, would you like to be an owner of this business?"
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   What would you do?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You'd look around and you'd say,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   "Well, do we have customers?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Do we have business? Do we have employees?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Do we have facilities?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Do we have plants and equipment?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And if so, then yeah, I'd probably like to be an owner."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Now, we don't know exactly the terms,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   but a good, high-quality business
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   is the kind of thing that you want to own.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And so, if I say,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "And if you buy that business,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   can you imagine, in most cases,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   that business not being worth what you paid for it in a few years?"
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Certainly, some businesses can be in the decline,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   but if you own a business
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   that's a high-quality business,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   then, generally speaking,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   you're going to want to keep owning it.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Because even if you can't sell it for as much as
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   you'd like to sell it for today,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   in a few years, you'll be able to sell it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   At least get your money out, in most cases.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So, how do you...
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   So now, if we flip it around,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   like, let's say that I take you across town
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and I show you some brand-new business
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   that's more of a speculation,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   brand-new industry or brand-new concept,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   brand-new idea, maybe a brand-new business manager,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   brand-new staff, something like that.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Or, in an industry where it's kind of questionable,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and I say, "Do you want to just buy this and own it
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and put it away for the next 10 years?"
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   You're not so sure.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So, that's more of a speculation, more of a trade.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Whereas the first one, you're well-suited,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   just buy and hold.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And although I'm kind of thoughtful about
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   wanting to take it to the crypto markets,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   this is basically the argument that people make
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   about the difference between Bitcoin
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and some other competing currencies.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Is that, do you want to buy something that is stable
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   versus do you want to buy something that is more speculative?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And I'm going to try to minimize my conversation there,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   but I wanted to mention it because, of course,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   massive declines recently and big down prices
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   in many of the crypto markets.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So, if you're a buy and hold investor,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   what is the basic thing you need to know
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   about your investments in order for you
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   to be comfortable holding them during times of fluctuation?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   You need to know that they are good quality investments.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   You need to know that you bought a good house.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Yeah, it might need a new roof, but at its core,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   it's a good house, it's got good bones.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   You need to know that it's a good company.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Yeah, we might have to tweak management a little bit
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   or tweak our product line, but fundamentally,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   it's a good company.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   It's not just some fly-by-night operation.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   It's a good company.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now, most of us are not out just buying individual houses
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   or just buying individual companies,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   although that can work fine.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   If I myself owned a portfolio of two or three
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   high-quality companies, publicly traded companies,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   the stocks, I mean, the stocks of these companies,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I could sleep very well at night.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Now, of course, people worry about that.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   They say it's not enough diversification.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   At its core, I've always been a little skeptical of that.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I really have been.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Are you going to tell me that if I own shares
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   in a high-quality company,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   that that's not enough diversification for me?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   If you think about in the modern world
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   what company ownership represents,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   you pick your favorite company.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   It can be an old, traditional company.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   It can be a new, modern tech company.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   You pick your favorite company
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   and think about what that company owns.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Well, if it's something that's on your radar screen
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   and if it's a publicly traded stock that's easy to buy,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   there's a good chance that company has thousands
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   and thousands of people that work for it.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Those thousands and thousands of people
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   have a lot of really smart people among them
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   who come to work every day trying to figure out
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   how do we make this company grow?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   How do we make it more profitable?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   How do we serve our clients better?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   The company probably has income from across the world
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   in lots of different currencies.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   They have operations in many different countries.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   They own equipment. They own real estate.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   They own trucks. They own trains. They own planes.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   They own equipment in all kinds of different countries.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And that company fundamentally is a really, really solid thing.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I always find it funny, or I still find it funny,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   when a guy with one job and just little savings
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   comes along and says, "Well, it's risky to have one stock."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Now, I grant the argument.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Having just one stock of one company
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   is a bit risky for my taste.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   But at its core, owning stock in one company
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   is far less risky than having only one job.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Especially if we're talking about a big, publicly traded company.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Yeah, there might be big fluctuations in price,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   but imagine the biggest crash,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   and you go from a 50% crash in the stock value.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   It's still a lot easier to lose a single job.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So what do you do?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Well, you diversify your investments
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   if you're a buy-and-hold investor.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You purchase more than one company's stock.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Maybe it's three. Maybe it's five. Maybe it's ten.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Ten is a really good benchmark.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Having no more than 10% of your assets
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   invested in any one company or any one thing
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   is a pretty good, useful benchmark to work towards.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Maybe it's literally thousands.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Most of my listeners will own mutual funds.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Many of those mutual funds will have ownership
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   in hundreds, in some cases thousands, of different companies.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Thousands of companies.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   So take everything that I said about a great company
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and multiply that times hundreds of different scenarios.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You have hundreds of different markets,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   hundreds of different industries.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Now you're not just dependent on one industry,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   but now you have hundreds of industries represented.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And then all of those same multiplier effects that I mentioned
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   in terms of operations in hundreds of different countries in the world,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   markets, hundreds of little markets,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   hundreds of different kinds of currencies
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   that we're accepting as payment for our business,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   hundreds of different pieces of real estate in dozens of countries,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   thousands of workers spread all around the world.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So we're pulling from the best global talent in the world.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And now you see the world of modern business.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's spectacular.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's utterly spectacular in terms of the simple and easy access
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   to high-quality companies,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   the best companies of America and the world
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   available to you for mere pennies.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And your ownership in those companies represents a tiny fractional share
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   in the current and future profits and dividends of those companies.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   That's what it reflects.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   If any of this resonates with you,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   then you'll know what to do as a buy-and-hold investor.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   The answer is you go forward.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Now what gets a buy-and-hold investor excited?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The answer is to be able to buy high-quality assets that are on sale.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   So if there are things that you want, right?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Imagine that really nice house across the street.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   It was listed for $600,000 a few months ago.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Didn't sell, didn't sell.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   They dropped the price to $550,000.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Now they just put a sign out and said $475,000.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Well, man, you get pretty excited, right?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   You start working the numbers.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You say, "Can I buy that thing for $475,000?"
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Imagine that you had a company that you were excited that it was on sale previously
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   at $20 a share.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Now it's down to $18.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Now it's down to $15.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Now it's down to $13.50.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   What do you do?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Well, you round up as much money as you can.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   You buy as much as you can.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Imagine you were excited about Bitcoin at $50,000 U.S. token coins per Bitcoin.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Well, now it's down to $30,000.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You look around and you say, "Can I scratch around?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Can I come up with any loose change and pick up a little bit more?"
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   That's the mentality that you should have if you're buying quality assets.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   You buy quality assets and you buy as much of them as you can when they are on sale.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Why?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Because if you're buying quality assets, it's hard to imagine that in the coming years
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   other people won't see the same value that you see in those quality assets.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Five years from now, 10 years from now, 50 years from now, the idea is you'll still own
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   those assets and you can sell them at any point along the way that you want to sell them.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   That's the basic fundamental logic of being a buy-and-hold investor.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   A buy-and-hold investor should stay the course during times when markets are down
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and that buy-and-hold investor should buy as much more as he possibly can during times
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   when markets are down.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   When high-quality assets are on sale, buy as many of them as you can.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We'll get to trading in a moment, but you say, "Joshua, I'm not so sure.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Why are all the high-quality investments down in value?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Why? What's going on?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Why do other people not see what I see?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Why are they willing to sell me their $600,000 house for $475,000 today?"
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   In the case of the individual house, you walk across the street and you ask them,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   "Why are you selling the $600,000 house for $475,000?"
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   They'll usually tell you, "Well, we want to do this.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   We need the money because of that.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   We don't care about it because of this."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   People have all kinds of reasons to sell.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   "I'm getting divorced. Dad died and we're just selling the house.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   None of us want it.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   We really want to buy a business that we think is going to make us $475,000 a year
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and we'd rather trade our $475,000 house out quick so we can buy this business."
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Any number of reasons.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Or, "We just want to move. We don't like the house anymore and we don't need the money.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It's not a big deal. It's not worth hanging on.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   We're tired of it. It's got termites. Who knows?"
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   What about big-scale markets like the stock market that's hard to figure out?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Well, the answer there is you've got millions and millions of people
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   making independent, different decisions as to why they think they're willing to sell you these assets
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   that yesterday were priced at $20 a share and today they're willing to sell it to you for $15 a share.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Some of those reasons can be personal.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   "Need the money. Got to sell. Just got to sell."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Some of those reasons can be based upon their trading strategy.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "Got to cover an option that I wrote," or "I got to figure out some way to pay for my kid's college."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   But the point is that you have to recognize that there's really no way to know.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   The Wall Street Journal will report every day, or All Things Considered will report every day,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and will say, "Markets moved down because of fears of inflation,"
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   or "Markets moved down because of interest rate risks."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   There's certainly probably some predictive factor to that,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   but overall it's completely unknowable.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   The market is literally just an approximation of the net results
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   of millions and millions of different decisions.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Remember that for every seller there's a buyer.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   For every buyer there's a seller.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And so for everyone who sold, somebody bought.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And those prices just kind of wander around.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And some days you can think you know why those prices are what they are,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   and some days you can't know.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Some days it makes sense to you, some days it doesn't make sense to you.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   But you just stay the course.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So if you're a buy-and-hold investor,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   then your strategy is simply to try to buy high-quality assets
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and hold them for a really long time, preferably forever,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   and buy more of them when they're cheap.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   So how do you buy more of them when they're cheap?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Well, this is usually known as dollar-cost averaging.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   One of the basic things that you can do is you just say,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   "Hey, every month I can afford to invest $2,000 a month.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   So I'll just buy $2,000 a month."
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And when things are expensive, you naturally buy a little less.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   If stocks are $20 a share, you can't buy as much as you can when they're $15 a share.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And so if you invest the same amount of money over time,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   then you are able to buy more.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   What if you're not so sure of the value of your investments?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   We'll come to that in a moment.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Now let's talk about trading.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   When it comes to trading, there is an infinite variety
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   of different strategies that you can follow as a trader.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   There are traders that own stocks for a few nanoseconds.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   There are traders that own stocks for a few minutes, few hours,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   few days, few weeks, few months.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   With real estate, there is an infinite variety of different trading strategies
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   that you can use.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   You can fix places up and sell them.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   You can flip contracts, all kinds of things that you can do.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   So as a trader, what you're looking for is trades that meet your parameters.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It's hard for me to talk about trading in any kind of useful way
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   when I speak about it in a general way.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   What you need to simply remember is that traders can use strategies
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   that work for them when markets go up.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Traders can use strategies that work for them when markets go down.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   You can make money in any direction on a move.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And so a trader has to understand his specific strategy
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   and then follow it as the actual opportunities emerge.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I can't cover that in a generalized way,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   but if you're a trader, you already know your plans.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   If you put a stop loss on your stocks because that was your trading strategy,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   then those stop losses were triggered.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   If you are following some kind of short-term holding pattern,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   you follow your indicators.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   You can't look at the general market.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   You follow your indicators for your specific strategy.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I think at least 80% of people will be more naturally well-suited
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   to being buy-and-hold investors than to follow any kind of trading strategy.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   It's not that trading strategies, in my opinion, are bad or wrong or flawed,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   but rather that most people just aren't interested enough to follow it.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I have known this about myself for a very long time.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   I really enjoy finance. I love finance.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   I am bored silly with the idea of trading.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   I'm temperamentally suited to be a buy-and-hold investor,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   to buy good quality investments and hold them forever.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   When I need money, borrow against them, then pay off the debt
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   and just keep on holding them.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   As they grow in value, take a little bit of the value, spend it,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and just hold it forever.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   It fits my temperament, fits my goals,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and so trading strategies have just never, ever been an interest of mine.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I acknowledge it can work, but if they're an interest of yours, follow that.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   But there's a lot of people who think that they should all of a sudden switch
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   from being a buy-and-hold investor to being a trader
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   just because they somehow perceive something different.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   People have been sounding all--
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Let's go back to the safety of what if things have changed?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   What are the concerns that people have right now?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Well, a big concern is inflation.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   But what's actually changed about inflation in the last year
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   in terms of the predictions versus not?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   We've got real numbers, but the predictions on inflation
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   have held pretty true over the last year.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   So time will follow through.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And so you don't have--as far as I can tell,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   you don't have any unique insight on the situation.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I don't have any unique insight on the situation.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   We're all in it together.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It just kind of presses forward.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   And so the markets are going to wander around,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   but is the bottom really going to fall out?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I think a lot of people have a lot of significant fears
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   that they think are really impactful
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   but they're the only ones who see.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Now, I've been a doomer in times past.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I no longer am.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   But I've worked through a lot of those things
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and I realize they're just not the case.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   First, most of my audience is based in the United States.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And Americans have a strong impulse
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   to overestimate how shaky their position is.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   This happens in the government.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   This happens in individual citizens, etc.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I myself have been a significant critic
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   of the United States of America.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But I'm here to tell you,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   it's not going to fall apart today.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I promise.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   It's not going to fall apart today.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   I'll get to an answer in just a moment of,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "Okay, what if it does fall apart?"
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Because I believe in planning in case it does fall apart.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   But it's not going to fall apart.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   This is not the end of America.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Notice I said earlier hyperinflation around the world.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   There's hyperinflation all around the world right now.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It's not just Venezuela.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   It's not just Russia.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   It's more normal places.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Argentina, which has hyperinflation about every three months.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Sorry, Argentinians.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   It's Turkey right now.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   There's just significant inflation all around the world,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   in many places.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   But these countries don't collapse.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And what you see is you see everyone rush to safety.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And where is the safest economy in the world right now?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   United States of America.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Safest stock market in the world right now?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   American stock market.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   It is so huge and so vast
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and has so many of the great global brands available in it
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   that while there can be interesting opportunities
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   in other markets and other places,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and while I think that there are many other markets
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   that could provide...
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   I'm trying to parse my words carefully.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   There are many other markets to provide a lot of things
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   that the US market doesn't.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   At its core, the American stock market is still king.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   It's powerful. It's easy. It's wonderful.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And the United States of America is powerful.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   It's so good.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   When you think about all the risks
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   that face countries around the world,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and having been a big proponent of internationalization myself,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I've studied a lot,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I often just come back and reflect
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   on how good the United States of America is,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   especially when measured on a global metric,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   in terms of everything from fresh water, food supply,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   industrial opportunities, stability of government,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   stability of currency, powerful workforce,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   educated workforce, abundant workers available.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's just on so many metrics,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   it continues to be the leader in the world.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And so while I think that significant challenges
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   are coming in the coming decades,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and I think there will continue to be
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   wonderful international opportunities,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   don't freak out thinking that,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   "Oh, the United States of America is here."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It's not.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Rest and follow your strategy.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   At its core, I believe that most people
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   should do exactly nothing
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   during times of great fear
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and during times of great greed.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   If you avoid taking a big action
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   during times of great fear and times of great greed,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   you will most likely make the right decision.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   If you think about your lifetime,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and you think about how different things can be
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   in a mere year from the event
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   that you're most concerned about,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   or three years from the event
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   that you're most concerned about,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   or five years from the event
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   that you're most concerned about,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   it's probably going to be better
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   three years, five years, ten years from now.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Let's talk through a few.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Today, of course, we have inflation fears.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   But let's go back a couple years,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   beginning of the pandemic.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Markets down.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Inflation fear is significant.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   We're printing extra trillions of dollars
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   to pay money that we don't have
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   in the United States.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Global situation.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Just think how different things are today,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   two years later.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Most of those fears,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   a few realized in a very small measure.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Most of those things, dead and gone.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Pandemic, it was bad, deadly.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Not as bad as we feared at that time.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Markets corrected quickly.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Went on to have a major increase
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   in market values.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Go back to 2008, 2009,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   within working memory of most of us.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Major fears.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And yet, what followed?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Incredible times of profitability.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Incredible times of growth.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   In real estate, stocks, so many things.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   And so, while I want to be slow to say
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   that stuff always goes up,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   because that's not necessarily the case.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   If you bet on stuff going up,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   and on things getting better in the future
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   versus things getting worse,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   in most cases,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   history has proven you to be right.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   So, what do you do?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   What can you do?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   First thing that you can do
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   is you can practice good personal financial planning.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   We have a tendency to overlook
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   the importance of the basics.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   For example, when I was a financial advisor,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I would tell people,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   "Don't invest money in the stock market
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   that you think you might need in the next five years."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   You've heard that so much, it sounds trite.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It sounds stale.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   It doesn't sound like good advice.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It sounds like old advice.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And yet, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in it.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   If today, you have money in the stock market
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   that you need for an expense that is important to you,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   that you're planning to spend six months from now,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   there's a good chance
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   that you're not very comfortable right now.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   But, in hindsight,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   the time to take that money out of the stock market
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   would have been, say, four and a half years ago,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   or three and a half years ago,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   or two and a half years ago, etc.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Because as that expense is approaching,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   you become more susceptible to market volatility.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And there was any number of opportunities
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   where you could have sold and taken the money and gone
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   and prepared for that expense.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   So, I think that this is a good reason for you today
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   to sell something, even when prices are down.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   If in your personal financial planning,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   you have an expense coming up that you need money for,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   then that is an appropriate reason for you
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   to sell your investments and set the money aside.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Not to say it's without risk.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   You might be selling when things are down.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   They could be higher in the future.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   You have to judge for yourself.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   But, if you have an expense coming up
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that you need money for,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   you know the date and time of it,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   then that's a good reason for you to sell investments.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Good personal financial planning is how you answer that.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   You have savings, and you plan ahead for expenses,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   selling investments when you need to,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   to cover those expenses.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   We teach this most and most effectively
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   when we talk about retirement planning.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Making sure that you always have money set aside
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   to cover your retirement expenses.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   But it applies at every stage along the way.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   What other rules of personal financial planning
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   can be followed?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Well, this is why we focus so much
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   on conservative cash flow needs.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   If you don't need a ton of money
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   to cover your personal expenses,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   then you can be more flexible with selling investments.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Generally speaking, stocks have a higher return
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   than the cost of things like mortgage debt.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   So, it's crazy to ever sell stocks
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   or invest less money in stocks
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   so that you can pay off your mortgage faster,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   from a general financial perspective.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And yet, lots of sophisticated, smart,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   wealthy people make that decision.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Why?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   The answer is, there's a real value
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   in minimizing uncertainty.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And there are times in life
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   in which you happily take a lower return
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   in order to maximize certainty
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and maximize flexibility, maximize freedom.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   So, in your personal financial planning,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   keeping your personal outlay low
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   can allow you to respond to market conditions
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   very effectively.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   You can say, "Hey, I believe in the value of my assets
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   long term, but I don't want to get in a situation
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   where I have to sell my investments quickly."
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   So, good personal financial planning
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   seeks to maximize your personal safety
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and to maximize your flexibility,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   because those are things that you can control
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   while you're not able to control the fluctuations
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   and the random wanderings around of markets
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   that reflect the opinions of millions and millions
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   of other people.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   A good reason to sell investments
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   when they're declining in value
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   is that you need the money
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   to cover some personal expense.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   That's a good reason.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Another good reason to sell investments
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   when they're declining in value
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   is if you have an alternative investment
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   that you really believe is better or better for you.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   See, what I'm trying to do here is simply
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   articulate a few reasons why I think you should sell investments
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   so that you don't think that guys like me
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   are just always saying, "Ah, don't sell stocks."
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   You can sell your stocks if you have a trading strategy
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   that involves your selling stocks.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   You can sell your stocks and feel good about it
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   when they're down,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   if you have to cover a personal expense.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And you can also sell stocks when they're down
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   and feel good about it
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   if you have an alternative investment
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   that is really exciting and that you think will beat
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   what you're currently invested in.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   It's a fallacy to think,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "Hey, I bought a good investment.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   It's just always going to go up."
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   From time to time, you may have bought a good investment,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   but then you may come across another better investment
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   that you want to invest money into
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   that you think is going to be better for you.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And at that point in time, that's a good reason for you
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   to sell the first investment
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   and move on to the second one.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   You don't have to think about this
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   like some kind of emotional thing.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   If you genuinely have a better investment
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   that you are excited about,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   then go ahead and pursue it.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Go ahead and move into it.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Some of the best times to make those transitions
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   from an okay investment to a better investment
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   come when things are falling apart.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   So be open to that.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Be aware of that.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Beyond that, it's hard for me to think of a good reason
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   to sell a high-quality investment
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   during a time of market decline.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Market decline is a good time for you to work,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   to make as much as you can
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   to buy high-quality investments when they are on sale.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I'm so concerned that this just sounds trite.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Okay, Joshua, we know that.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I get it, but that's it.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   If I think of most scenarios that people would propose,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I think that those two reasons,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   especially with the comment on trading strategies,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   that, hey, if you've got a trading strategy
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   that you created before the decline, follow it.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Great. Go for it.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Lots of people have strategies that say,
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   "I'm never just going to sit tight while my stocks go down."
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Sure, go for it. That's fine.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Just make sure you decided that before this happened
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   or before this is happening.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Otherwise, your reasons for doing it
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   are going to come down to, number one, I need the money,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and number two, I've got a better investment.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   See, that's the problem, right?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   You've always got to know what you're going to invest in.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Are you just going to sell your investment and sit in cash?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   I think today, actually this time around,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   with inflation concerns,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   people are much more open to the danger of just doing that.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   It's not usually the danger of inflation
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   that causes the problems with that strategy.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Usually, it's the danger of just sitting on it
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   and not getting in before it all goes up.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It happens to so many people.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   We sell out, then we sit and we sit and we sit,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   and we say, "All the reasons I sold are all the reasons
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   that I'm still out of the market,"
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   but you just sit and sit and sit,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   and, hey, it never goes up.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Sorry, it goes up before we get back in.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   But, so cash is not a great thing to have.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   It's better to have an asset,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and if you tell me, "Joshua, right now,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   you could have a million dollars of cash
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   or a million dollars of stock.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Unless I've got a great alternative investment
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that I can quickly turn the cash into stock,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   I want to own the stock,"
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   or into whatever the other investment is.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   It can be anything.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   "I want to own the stock.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I want to own something that's an actual investment,
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   especially during times of turbulence,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   unless I need the money for a personal expense."
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   So that's it.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   So, in conclusion, if you are concerned right now
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   about the market decline, fine, great.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   So ask yourself, "What's my strategy?"
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   For 20% of people, you already have a trading strategy.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Go, follow it.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   For most of us, it's just buy and hold.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Buy good quality assets and hold them forever.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   That's it. Simple as that.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   So ask yourself, "Is this a good quality asset?"
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   If it is, then keep it.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   You don't have to sell it.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   You don't sell your house just because
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   the market value goes down 15%.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   You don't freak out and do that.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   So just keep your good quality assets.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Look at your personal financial planning,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and then say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I got this personal financial needs over here to take care of."
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   And then, if you have a better investment,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   consider selling for that to buy the better investment.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   But at its core, those are the only reasons
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   you should ever sell an investment.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   It should not be due to a most likely temporary decline
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   in a stock market index
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   or whatever thing you're currently following.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   There are black swan events that can occur.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Those black swan events are probably best solved
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   with good personal financial planning
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and with good preparedness planning.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   This is why I'm an advocate of good financial planning
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   and why I'm an advocate of good prepping.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Why do I have a course called internationalescapeplan.com?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Well, because there are things that could happen in a country
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   that are genuinely so catastrophic
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   that you're better off to go out.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   But you aren't any better if you sold your investments
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and you have all the cash in that country
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   if you've got to get out.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   So you put in place an international escape plan.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   There's things that can happen to food supplies,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   but you're not going to sell your 401(k) to buy food.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   You just need to have a little bit of extra food
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   so you can get through a temporary famine.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Things that can happen that can wipe out your local area.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   A storm can come through.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   A tornado can wipe you out.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   So you need to make sure you have good homeowners insurance.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   You could get hit in a car accident today and be injured,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   so you make sure you have good disability income insurance.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   You could have a heart attack and die,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   so you make sure you have good life insurance.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   So a good combination of financial planning and prepping
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   solves for most of those big worst-case scenarios,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   not selling your stocks.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   That's a separate conversation.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   If you have a better investment for your stocks, go for it.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   If that means a different country that has better demographics
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   or better finances, go for it.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   But at its core, don't freak out just because markets decline
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and then go and sell.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   You will regret it.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Buy high-quality assets and keep them,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   or follow your trading strategy.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   That's it.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Hope this is helpful, useful.
