[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Pastor John, here's a question that we get often in the Ask Pastor John email inbox,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.880]   worded in various ways, but here's the main thread in this common question.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.660]   Is an addiction to pornography an unpardonable or unforgivable sin?
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.720]   In the way I understand the Bible about sin, the only sin that cannot be pardoned is the
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.740]   sin that cannot be repented of.
[00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.280]   And what I mean by repented of is at least four things.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:47.080]   One is a sin that produces remorse for the offense to God, not just the pain of the punishment.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.400]   And two, a sin that is put consciously by faith under the blood of Christ.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:03.360]   And three, a sin that is fought with dependence on the Holy Spirit, Romans 8, 13, "Put to
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   death the deeds of the body by the Spirit."
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.840]   And fourth, a sin that we renounce, we consciously say no to, renounce, with a genuine embrace
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.080]   of Christ as our superior treasure.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.360]   That's what I mean by the repentance of sin.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.680]   Any sin that you can repent of will be forgiven.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.500]   There is though, and this is probably why the question was asked, there is a depth and
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:43.040]   extent of sinning that is so deep and so long that the sinner can't repent anymore.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.220]   And the reason I feel frighteningly confident to say that is because Esau is given in Hebrews
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.480]   as an example of that very thing.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.520]   And what's so stunningly relevant of that here is because the writer introduces Esau
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.320]   illustrating the need to fight sexual immorality.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.920]   He says in Hebrews 12, 15, "See to it that no one is sexually immoral."
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   Now, as far as we know, that wasn't the issue with Esau.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.480]   Maybe when he married those pagan women, but it says, "See to it that no one is sexually
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   immoral."
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.600]   He's using Esau as an example of that.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.880]   "Unholy like Esau who sold his birthright for a single meal, for you know that afterwards
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected for he found no place of repentance."
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   And I think that means not a physical lethality, but there was no place in his heart as he
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.120]   cast about trying to find a real repentance in his heart.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   It wasn't there, even though he was crying.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.560]   And that's why I said the remorse has to be more than just remorse for the loss of punishment.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.600]   So there is a too late in our compromise with sin.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.440]   God does at times withdraw his patient protection from final destruction and hand us over like
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Romans 1.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.960]   God gave them over to dishonorable passions.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.760]   And it was 126 or 128.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.140]   God gave them over to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.960]   But here's the encouragement.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.480]   Here's what I want to press in on this person's conscience for hope.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.680]   It says in Romans 2, 4, "Don't presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.120]   and patience."
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.800]   So God is long suffering and he's patient.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   But you realize that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   So I would say to this person, don't assume it's too late.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.320]   Assume that God's mercy is still leading you to repentance.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.440]   Assume he's still at work in your life.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.760]   After all, the question has arisen.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.160]   You are not giving up, it sounds like.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   So my answer is, an addiction to pornography is not unforgivable if it is repented of,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360]   which means it would be temporary.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.660]   And I don't know how long it might last.
[00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.240]   God alone knows how long it would go on.
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   And he's very, very patient.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.720]   So the question is, knowing the present bondage, that's what I take an addiction to be, knowing
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.480]   the present bondage, are you making war on it?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.200]   Do you keep making war?
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   Now there's the question.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.440]   Sometimes guys will say, "I've tried to make war.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   It doesn't work."
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   I say, "Well, you think the battle's over?
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.980]   It's not over.
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.400]   Do you keep making war as long as it takes?
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.480]   Or have you given up and settled in and made peace with your sin?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   If that's the case, you're in big trouble.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.740]   So are you putting it to death?
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.160]   It may be, it no doubt is a very resilient foe.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.000]   It may refuse to die all at once, but the question is, do you keep thrusting the sword
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.880]   of the Spirit through it over and over again?
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.760]   And I stumble onto this in thinking about this question as a final practical suggestion.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:31.520]   It says in 1 John 5, 16, "If anyone sees his brother committing a sin, not leading to death,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:39.480]   he shall ask, and God will give him," that is the sinning brother, "life."
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:47.220]   So if you see someone in an addiction or a bondage to sexual immorality, then you ask
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   for that person.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.740]   So I would say one of the marks of the sin that you're committing not leading to death
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:03.840]   is that you are willing to find a brother and ask him to pray for you.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.160]   And that prayer, 1 John 5, 16 says, will be one of God's instruments in delivering you.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   Yes, good.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.240]   That's a great point.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.540]   So the bottom line is don't presume that you can sin today and repent tomorrow, and don't
[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.400]   despair that you cannot repent today for the sin yesterday.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   Excellent.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.480]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.460]   Our other Ask Pastor John episodes deal with pornography directly, and each of them can
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.960]   be found in the archives.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.720]   Episode 18 is about fighting porn with theology.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.440]   Episode 60 is about men fighting porn with a brother in Christ.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.080]   Episodes 122 and 165 deal with how a woman should respond to her boyfriend or husband's
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080]   porn addiction.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.740]   Well as you know, there's an interesting new trend in our churches, a trend that Charles
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.720]   Spurgeon and a whole lot of pastors were never concerned with, electronic Bible apps and
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.640]   smartphones and tablets.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.080]   So what's better for church, bringing a printed copy of the Bible or bringing an illuminated
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080]   screen?
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.480]   What are the pros and cons of each?
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.200]   A listener wants to know, and Monday we'll hear Pastor John's thoughts.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.600]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.440]   Have a great weekend.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   [END]
