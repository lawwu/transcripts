[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   I always tell people that if they're not comfortable with going somewhere online, then go to your
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.440]   local coin shop.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.120]   If you find a collection or you have a collection that's passed down, on the off chance that
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.480]   there's something quite valuable, a local coin shop could tell you very quickly.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.080]   The general stance is that doing research on Google and stuff is probably going to lead
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.680]   you in the bad way.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.820]   So I think the quickest and easiest search is just local coin shop, and then just go
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.960]   to whatever one has the best reviews.
