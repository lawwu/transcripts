[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5, verses 9 and 10.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Verses 9 and 10 in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   But to get the context, I'd better read again from verse 8.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   "For ye were sometimes darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light."
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them." And so on.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Now, you will recall that we are studying this exhortation which the apostle here addresses to these Christians at Ephesus and elsewhere.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   This exhortation in which he calls upon them to walk as children of light.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's one of the forms which he gives to his various appeals and exhortations to them,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   to walk in a manner that is worthy of their high vocation and calling in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, we are looking at this particular exhortation in this way.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   The apostle, as usual, gives us very good reasons for making the exhortation.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And the fundamental reason here is that the Christian is a man who has undergone a very profound change.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord."
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Well, we've got to start with that.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We've got to realize what the Christian is.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And he's a man, I say, who is essentially different from the man who's not a Christian.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   There should be no difficulty about telling whether we are Christian or not.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's the difference between darkness and light.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And secondly, we saw that it's not a superficial difference, it's a very deep and profound one.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The unbeliever is not only in the dark, he is darkness.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And likewise, the Christian is not merely a man who's received a certain amount of light, he is light in the Lord.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   There is light in the very center of his being and his constitution.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And so, we have been looking at the characteristics of these two people.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That's the contrast the apostle puts before us.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We are not to be as we were, we are now to be something different.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And we've reached the stage in which we are now looking at the characteristics,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   or if you like, the manifestations of these two different types of being and of character.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   We spent our time last Sunday morning in looking at the manifestations of the darkness.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Ye were sometimes darkness, and we saw how that manifested itself.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The darkness manifests itself in the whole of the character and the personality.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It shows itself in the mind, in the form of ignorance.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It shows itself in the heart, in a kind of dullness, foolishness, slothfulness,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   a kind of lethargy and deadness.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And it shows itself, as we saw, in the realm of the will.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   It's the works of darkness, and they're unfruitful works, and they're shameful works.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   There we saw the manifestations of that life of darkness, which is the characteristic and the truth about all who are not Christians.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Well, now then, we come and look at the other side.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We are no longer that, he says.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   You were sometimes that, but you're no longer that.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, what are you?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Well, no, he says you are light in the Lord.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Walk, then, as children of the light.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And before we can do that, we must be clear in our minds as to what are the manifestations of the light.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   In what way does this light that has come into our being and constitution, in the new birth, in the regeneration,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   in what ways does this light show itself and manifest itself in the life of the believer?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Well, now, it's not enough just to say that it's the exact opposite of what we've been seeing in the case of the darkness.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That is perfectly true, of course.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But it isn't enough just to say that.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And so often, Christian people have been content with just saying that they are now the exact opposite of what they were before.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's only the beginning.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That's only the first statement.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   To see the full meaning of this, we must look at it in detail and analyze it, to bring out its various sides and aspects.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It is the positive that is the thing that matters, and not merely the negative.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The fact, I say, that we are light in the Lord must be brought out and worked out in detail.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Why? Well, for these reasons.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That it is important that we should realize not only the difference between the Christian and the man who is blatantly and obviously and openly not a Christian,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   but it is equally important that we should show the difference between the man who is a true Christian, who is light in the Lord,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and the so-called good, moral man who is not a Christian.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now, that becomes important because of this ninth verse, where we are told that the manifestation, rarely, is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Now, there is a type of man to be had in the world who is not a Christian, and who tells us that he is not a Christian,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and almost boasts of the fact that he is not a Christian.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   But on the surface, he seems to be a good man, and a righteous man, and a man who is interested in truth and in integrity.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Nothing today, perhaps, is more important than that we should be clear as to the difference between the Christian and that good man,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   the so-called good pagan.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I have often referred to a book called "The Failure of the Good Pagan" by Rosalind Murray, and I commend it to you again.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It is a very good book, published about 15 years ago.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It is just an exposure of the failure of this good, moral man who is not a Christian,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and who is ultimately, I suppose, the chiefest enemy of the Christian faith.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Well, now, we have got to be positive and detailed about the manifestations of light
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   in order to show the difference between the Christian and that type of man.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And indeed, I could even put it like this.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It is essential we should go into the details in order that we may show the difference between a Christian and a religious man,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   because you can be religious without being a Christian.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And it is very important to differentiate again between these two.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   There are far too many religious people in the Church.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Religious only, I mean, people who are not Christians, but who stop at just being religious.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It is as we see the characteristics of the light that we shall be able to draw these all-important distinctions.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Because, I say again, the Christian is not merely a man who has been given a certain amount of light,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   or who has received a certain amount of enlightenment.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He is light.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   But now, are ye light in the Lord?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Very well, then, the question that arises is, how does this light manifest and show itself?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And here again, I adopt the same classification.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   It does so, first and foremost, in the intellect, in the mind.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   We have always got to start with this.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   What we have in the Bible is truth.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And truth is something that comes, obviously, primarily to the mind, the intellect, the understanding.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It is not some sort of vague feeling people get.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   You can get many sorts of vague feelings, but they may have nothing to do with Christianity at all.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   This is always a matter of truth.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So we start with the mind.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And the first thing we have to say about the Christian is, therefore,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   that he shows that since he has become light in the Lord, he has a knowledge which he lacked before.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Darkness was characterized by ignorance.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Light is characterized by knowledge and understanding.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But what is so important here is that we should be clear as to the nature of this knowledge.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And I say it is important, again, to differentiate between the Christian and these good moral men,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   and the Christian and just the religious men.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   What is the peculiar knowledge which has come to this man who has become light in the Lord?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, we start, of course, by saying that he has a knowledge of God.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Now, he has not merely a knowledge of certain things concerning God or a knowledge about God.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   That is accessible to anybody. That is open to all.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   No, this man has got a further knowledge.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   He is in the position described by our Lord in John 17, 3,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It is a knowledge about, of course, it includes that, but it goes beyond that.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   There is an apprehension and a knowledge of God open only to the Christian, and which everybody else lacks.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I can put this more generally by saying this,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   that the man who has become light in the Lord is a man who has knowledge of spiritual truth,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and an understanding of spiritual truth that the other man lacks.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now, let me put this very briefly in that well-known statement,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   which is found in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians and the second chapter.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   "A natural man," he says, "receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him;
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Now, what the apostle is there saying, of course, is this,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   that you can have a man with great intellect, great natural powers as regards the mind,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and thinking, and logic, and reasoning ability.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But he may be, and indeed if he is not a Christian, he is entirely ignorant of spiritual truth.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   He sees nothing in them, he doesn't understand them.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   That is, I suppose, the thing that differentiates the Christian from everybody else.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   The Christian has a spiritual faculty,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and it is this spiritual faculty that gives him an insight into, and an understanding,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and an apprehension of spiritual truth.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Now, everybody else lacks this.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   They have minds, they have intellects.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   If you present them with a political situation, they can understand it,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and they can reason about it, they can take it in.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   They can do the same with poetry, and with music,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   with sociology, science, and a thousand and one other subjects.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They have this ability which makes them competent to deal with,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and to take in a subject that you may hold before.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   But when you bring them to the realm of spiritual truth,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   they have no faculty which enables them to understand.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   They see nothing in it.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It is foolishness to them.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It is all a lot of nonsense.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   They dismiss it with a wave of the hand.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Now, you see the relevance of all this at the present time.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   There are many such people,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   and they are given great prominence on the wireless programs and television, and so on.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You see, the brains trust, the brains.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But have you noticed their ignorance of spiritual truth?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Have you noticed their complete failure to think spiritually?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   They can't help it, of course.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   They are blind.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   They are lacking in the faculty.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   They are not light in the Lord.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   They are darkness.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They are afflicted by this ignorance.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Their foolish hearts were darkened.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Their minds were blinded by the God of this world.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   That's their trouble.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And it brings out the distinction so clearly.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You see, it's not a question of intellectual capacity at all.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   That is the fallacy people drop into.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   People think that they are not Christians because of their great brains, their great intellectual capacity.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And alas, many a Christian tends to think like that,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   and is rather troubled by the fact that these great men are not Christians.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But you see, that's a denial of the whole of Christianity.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   It doesn't matter how perfect the instrument is.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   If it lacks this spiritual quality, this spiritual faculty, it can see nothing at all.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And it doesn't.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   The natural mind, the natural man,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   for they are foolishness unto him.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Quite so.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   He is still darkness.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   He is not light in the Lord.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, this is the first thing that he becomes aware of.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He's got a spiritual faculty.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He now possesses an understanding in this realm
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   where formerly he was such a stranger and felt himself to be an outsider.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   What does he understand?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Well, I've already mentioned the most important thing of all.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   He seems to have this apprehension of God,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   the being of God, the truth about God, and then his own soul.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   It's only the man who's got this light who really becomes concerned about his soul.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   These other people are not concerned about the soul at all.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Listen to them.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And you'll find they think of men as an animal,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and they think that death is the end.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And you see, they think they're paying themselves a compliment by talking like that,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   and they're denying the highest thing that is in men, the soul.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But you need a spiritual apprehension to be aware of the fact that you're a soul.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "In that dust thou art, a dust returnest," was not spoken of the soul.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   "This imperishable thing."
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Ah, but," they say, "when you dissect a body, you can't find an organ called the soul."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And they think they're clever, therefore, in dismissing it.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Oh, what ignorance.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   These things are spiritually deserved.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It is only the spirit that can reveal unto us the deep things of God.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   But the spirit does.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   That's the argument.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Well, very well.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And when it goes on, do you see we have an understanding and an apprehension of the fact of sin?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   These other people, they don't know what it means to be a sinner.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   The whole notion seems to them to be monstrous and to be ridiculous.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   You explain the whole of conduct in terms of environment or heredity or upbringing and things like that,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and they're not aware of the fact that there is this principle of evil in men.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   This thing that vitiates all our judgments, this bias, this tendency towards wrong and evil,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   what Paul calls this law in our members ever dragging us down.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It means nothing to them.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   They know nothing about a spiritual conflict within.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   But the moment a man becomes a Christian, he does.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   He's aware that he's the seat of this tremendous battle and fight.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He's aware that he's a sort of enigma.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   He's aware of these forces struggling within him, some for the soul, some against.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   He's aware of all that.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And then, you see, he comes and he looks at the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   The other men in darkness looks at Jesus Christ, whom he only calls Jesus, of course.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   That is their characteristic.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   They call him Jesus.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Christians shouldn't call him Jesus.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   He's the Lord Jesus Christ of the people of light.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   But they look at Jesus and they see but a man, a carpenter, a mere teacher, and so on,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   a pacifist or something like that, and that's all they see in him.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You need to have eyes enlightened by the eye salve of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   before you can really see him.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And you begin to see the marvel and the mystery of his person.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   You see the divine, you see the human.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You see the divine nature, you see the human nature.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   You see the two there together.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   They're unmixed, they're both there, but they're not mingled.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You look at the marvel and the mystery and you take your stand with the Apostle Paul
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and you say, "Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   God was manifest in the flesh."
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Now, to the Christian, this is something of which he's aware.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   It means something to him.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   This is to him the greatest thing in life.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   This is the most extraordinary thing.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   This is no longer something ridiculous which he dismisses
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and says he can't understand scientifically.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   "No, no," says the Christian, "these things are spiritually deserved."
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And it is to him the most marvelous and most glorious truth of all
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   that the incarnation has taken place.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   God was manifest in the flesh.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And so he goes and looks at the person of the Lord
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   and the truth concerning him, and he has an apprehension of it.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And it means the most vital thing of all to him.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And likewise, you see, with the way of salvation.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I mustn't stop with these things, and yet I'm compelled to mention them.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The man who is light in the Lord is a man who knows the way of salvation.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And he can explain it to others.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   This isn't merely the teaching of the Apostle Paul.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The Apostle Peter, you remember, in his first epistle in the third chapter
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   says the same thing where he says, "Be ready at all times
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   to give a reason for the hope that is in you with meekness."
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   "Be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is in you."
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Now the Christian can do that.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He's got an understanding of the one and only way of salvation.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I leave it at that. Work it out.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The whole of this great and glorious truth.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   The Christian is a man, I say, who comes to it with a new mind.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   He's light in the Lord.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   This book means everything to him.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   He sees this extraordinary truth in it.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And he has an increasing understanding of it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   There's his intellect, his mind.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   But let me say just a word about the heart.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Yes, he not only has this new understanding and apprehension,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   but he has a heart that can respond to it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   You see, there are men sometimes who seem to be so constituted
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   that they can take a kind of intellectual interest in this book,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   but their hearts don't respond to it.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   There are people who are interested in the Bible as literature.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   There are people who are interested in the Bible as philosophy, and so on.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Yes, but they're not gripped and moved by the truth.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   But a man who is light in the Lord, his heart is light.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And he's a man who knows something about feeling the power of the truth,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   the power of the word that is found here.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   He's moved by it.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Now, this is of necessity true of the Christian.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   He is light in the Lord, and the whole man is light in the Lord.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   He has obeyed, as the apostle puts it in writing to the Romans,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   he has obeyed from the heart the form of sound doctrine delivered to him.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   The complete man is engaged.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And so we must emphasize that the Christian is a man who shows that he's got light in his heart.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   His emotions are engaged.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   He desires holiness.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   He must desire holiness.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   I'm not saying he's sinless and perfect. No, no.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But though he sins, I say he desires holiness.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He hungers and thirsts after righteousness.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That is the desire of his heart.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   The desire of his heart is to be delivered from sin,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   is to know God and to know the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   to know this word, to know its truth.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   That's the relationship of his heart to these matters.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   His heart has become light in the Lord.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   But I hurry on to the third aspect, which is the will.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   And I say I hurry on to this because this is the realm about which the apostle is particularly concerned
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   in this section with which we are dealing.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It's all there, but this is the thing which he emphasizes supremely.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Now you notice the way in which he puts this.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Here we come to character as it shows itself in expression, in action.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And he puts it like this in verse 9.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "For the fruit," I'm reading out of the authorized translation,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Now this is unfortunate.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It shouldn't be the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   The best manuscripts are all agreed in saying that it should be translated as it is in the revised version as
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "The fruit of the light" or "The fruit of light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   You are light in the Lord.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   He says, "Well, now then, walk as children of light."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And then in brackets he puts it in, "The fruit of light is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth."
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And then he finishes his statement, "Walk as children of the light, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Now let's look at this analysis of his, of the fruit of the light.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Of course, it's the same thing. It's the Spirit that gives the light.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And it's not surprising that therefore this idea of the Spirit came in at this point.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   There is no light apart from the Spirit. He gives the light.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   So take it fruit of the Spirit, fruit of the light, it's equally true in both cases.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Now then, what is the truth about this?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And here we come again to this significant word.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   We saw last time that the characteristic of darkness is works.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Verse 11, "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   When you come to the light and look for the manifestations of light,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   you've no longer got works, but you've got fruit.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Let us look into the significance of this important word, this striking word,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   this contrast with the works of darkness.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Now, here is the great characteristic of the life of the true Christian, fruit.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   What does it tell us?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Well, the first thing it tells us is this, that it is only when a man becomes a Christian
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   that he really becomes natural.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   It is only the Christian who begins to approximate to what a man is meant to be.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I mean by that, of course, it is only the Christian who begins to approximate to what man was in his first creation.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   He was made and created in the image of God.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   He was made upright.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   He was given an original righteousness.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   But as the result of the fall and sin, all that has become lost.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And the trouble about man in sin is that he is a monstrosity.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   He is unnatural.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   If you want to see and to read what is perhaps one of the greatest expositions of that which you'll find in the whole Bible,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I commend to you to read a tome quietly today, Psalm 104.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And there you'll see the psalmist working through creation,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   how everything is displaying the glory of God, the mountains and the rivers and the brooks and the birds and the trees,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   the cedars of Lebanon that are full of sap, as he puts it.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And on he goes.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And then, having described the whole of creation, he looks at man.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And he feels there is only one thing to say about him.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "Let the sinners," he said, "disappear from the earth.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Let they be consumed out of sight."
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Why?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Because the sinner is a monstrosity in God's universe.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   He's become unnatural.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   So I say that when a man becomes a Christian, the first thing that's true about him is that he becomes natural.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And he begins to function as he was meant to do.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   The business of a fruit tree is to produce fruit.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   It's natural.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And you see, when this tree is put right, it begins to do the natural thing.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   It produces its fruit.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I wonder how often we think of the Christian in those terms.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   All people in the world this morning, I say, who are not Christians are unnatural.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   They're monstrosities.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   They're a denial of the true being of man.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It is Christianity alone that makes us men, worthy of the name.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   But come, let us work it out.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   There's something else.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   The next way I'd put it is this.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   That there is never anything artificial or mechanical or machine-like about the life of the Christian.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   The life of the Christian is rather reminiscent of fruit growing on a tree.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   We saw the other life was artificial.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   This isn't.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   The Christian should never give the appearance of being mechanical or machine-like or machine-produced.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Christians can't be produced to order or by numbers.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Neither can their life and their activities and their actions.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Now, this to me is of tremendous importance.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   It is here, I would say, we see the real difference between Christian behavior and living
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   and the kind of conduct and behavior that characterizes the devotees of the cults and false religions.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   They're always machine-made.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   They're always produced to order.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Let me put it in this form.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The life of the Christian should never give the impression that he's imposed a certain number of things upon himself.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   That's not a tree, that's a Christmas tree.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   You see, with your Christmas tree you have to hang the fruit onto it, the gifts and the presents.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But a tree isn't like that.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   That's an artificial tree.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   No, no, the characteristic of the tree is that the fruit comes out of it.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   You don't hang them onto it.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   So the Christian in his life and living, I say, should never give the impression that he's imposed upon himself a certain line of conduct and of behavior.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   You examine the cults and you'll find that that is true of every single one of them.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And anything that claims to be Christian, that gives that impression, is denying that it is Christian.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It may simulate it. It's very difficult at times, isn't it, to tell the difference between a living flower and an artificial one.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   People are very clever.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   They can make an artificial rose in such a manner that rarely it can almost deceive the expert.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   The devil becomes an angel of light and he counterfeits the truth.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   But it's still artificial.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It is still without life.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It is something manufactured and made.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Now we should never give that impression, the fruit of the light.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Or let me put it like this.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And here again is a very vital way of looking at it as I see this matter.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   There should always be a suggestion of the element of growth and of development in the life of the Christian.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   You look at it in terms of this fruit tree.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I'm not pressing the analogy, I'm just taking the analogy.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   You never get this, do you?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You go to bed one night, you've looked at the tree just before you went in and before the light went out.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And there it was, just the branches and the leaves, no more.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Now, this never happens with a tree.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Next morning you get up and you open your back door and you go out into your garden or your orchard.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And there you see the fruit tree, crowded, teeming with fruit, fully developed.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   You don't get that.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   No, no.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   You get buds and flowers, then you get just that little first appearance of the fruit.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Then it begins to grow and to develop and mature and to blossom.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   That's the Christian.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The fruit doesn't come suddenly, isn't imposed, it's not ready-made.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   But, you know, I find far too many ready-made Christians as regards conduct.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   You see, it's all taken in stages.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   First of all, you're taken to an evangelistic meeting, and there you get saved.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Well, then you're taken to some instruction and this is put upon you.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Then you're told what to do, and it's all perfect at once.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And immediately they're all ready-made and mass-produced.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That's not Christianity.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I say it deliberately, that is not Christianity.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   That is what the cults do.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   That is what false religions do.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   That is what illegalism does.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Religion can do that.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That is not the whole genius and essence of Christianity.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   This is fruit, my friends.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And I say there is always the element of growth and of maturing and of development.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Let me put another point to show the same thing.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It is characteristic of fruit that while essentially, of course, all the fruit is the same,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   it is equally true to say that there are always individual differences.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Look at an apple tree teeming with apples.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Well, you say they're all apples.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I agree, but they're not all identical.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   They're not all identical in shape.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   They're not all identical in the color.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   A little more red in one, a little less in another, and so on.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   There are all sorts of minor differences and variations.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It's all fruit.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   It's all apple.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   But there are all these differences.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   That's the characteristic of fruit.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   It is always the characteristic of true Christians.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But it is not the characteristic of the followers and the devotees of the cults and the false religions.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   They're always the same.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   They're mass-produced.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   You see one, you see them all.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   They're like postage stamps.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Peas in a pod.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   They're all like...
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   No, I shouldn't have said peas in a pod.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   That's fruit.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   The peas in the pod may look identical, but they are not, thank God.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   But the postage stamps are.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   There is always this subtle difference in the Christian.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Why am I pausing over this?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Well, I think it's one of the things we need to be reminded of above everything else at the present time.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   There is a certain type of Christian.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I claim that I can tell you, and I don't think I'd ever fail.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I can tell you the type of organization in which he became a Christian.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   He's got the stamp on him.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   This sameness in expression, in behavior, in everything.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Mass-produced.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   The stamp is there.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   It's machine-like.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   I say we must protest against all this in the name of the Spirit and the liberty of the Spirit.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   We are fruit.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   It's the fruit of the light.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And we must never allow anybody to impose a mold upon us.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Refuse to become a member of anything that puts a mold on you.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   We are called into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It's always, to me, a tragic thing to see young Christians conforming to a mold and to a pattern.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I've seen it come out even in matters of dress, and in the way they pronounce certain words, and so on and so forth.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Let us remember, I say, that we have got life, that we are fruit,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   and that the characteristic is this liberty which leads to variety and variation.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Or, to put all this still more strongly, let me put it like this.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   You see, the whole secret of fruit is this, that fruit is always something that comes from within outwards.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Fruit, in a sense, is the expression of the life of the tree that produces it.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Not from without, but from within.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Something that comes out of the character, out of the nature, out of the life.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And that is what the Christian is.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   And that is why I say we must never impose forms upon the Christian.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Not only forms of conduct and behavior.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You know, there are people who would even impose upon you what you are to do with your life.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   They try and make you become a foreign missionary, or a home missionary, or this or that.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Don't let them.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Never do anything because anybody else tells you to do.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It must come out of you.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   It must come out of your own light, your own experience, your own life, your own vitality.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   That's fruit.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Everything must be the result of what we are.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And we don't make ourselves what we are by what we do.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   We do what we do because we are what we are.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Fruit is that, I say, which comes from within and is the expression of the true nature.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   You were sometimes darkness, you are now light in the Lord.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Walk as children of light and the fruit of light is.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   That's it.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   That's the order.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   So I would even go further and say this, that not only must we not allow other people to dictate to us and to impose these things upon us.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   We must never even force ourselves.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   We mustn't even force ourselves.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   This is a very important point as I see it as regards guidance.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I've often said it before, I'll say it again.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   You must never decide to do anything solely in terms of your mind and your understanding.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   That is where people who say and teach that the need is the call are really denying this principle that we're dealing with this morning.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   The need is not the call.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   If the need were the call, well then I say that in an age like this every single Christian should go out of every secular employment and should go straight into whole time Christian work.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   If the need is the call, you can't dispute that.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But the need isn't the call and never has been.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   The need is a part of it, it comes into it.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But I say again that it is not a call until I know something of this inward constraint.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   This pressure of the sap rising up within me which makes me say with Luther I can do no other.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   That's a call.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   You see these things come from within, it is an expression of the nature.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   That is why the New Testament always puts its main emphasis not upon what we do but upon what we are.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   But you see the whole prevailing theory today in the church and less even in evangelical circles is the exact opposite.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Isn't this the cult? Isn't this the phrase?
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Let's be getting busy.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Let's get going.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   No, no, you don't decide to get going.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   God has put this principle within you, this light in your mind and heart and will.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   There's the dynamo.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   That's the thing that gets you going.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   It's the pressure from within.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   And what you and I are called upon to do you see is to cultivate the soul.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   If we cultivate the soul truly well then the fruit will appear, the actions, the conduct, the behavior, the vocation and all these other things will come out of it.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   There are too many hothouses in the Christian church.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Too many forcing apparatuses.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   It's the whole characteristic of life today isn't it?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   It's being done in agriculture.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   You're forcing with your artificial manures and you're going to ruin your land eventually.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   We've lost the old idea, nature's method, the natural humus and so on.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Everything's being forced.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Chemicals, artificial manure, production we say is the great thing.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Yes, and it will perhaps be one of the major problems for civilization in a few years.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And haven't you seen it in the matter of egg production?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   How they light up these poor pens in which these chickens are kept.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Artificial light throughout the night so that these poor hens are forced to produce.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   I say it's a violation of nature.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   It's wrong.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And it is wrong in the spiritual life also.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   You and I are not to have our eye primarily upon production or upon the quantity produced.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   We must never be concerned about our capacity to produce and about the quality of what we produce.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Yes, as this apostle puts it in writing to Timothy, our business is to see that we are vessels that are meat and fit for the master's use.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Let's get cracking, say people. Let's get busy.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   And do you notice their very terms?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   No, no, that's machine-like. That's starting off some machine.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Not at all.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   You, a business, and I are to be vessels that are fit and meet for the master's use.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   Let us think of ourselves as trees, living trees, with the nutriment, the sap, the life.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   We are branches. He is the vine and we are the branches.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   And as long as we look at it in this way, well, then I say we shall be unable to avoid most of these dangerous pitfalls,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   pitfalls to the individual soul and experience, pitfalls for the whole church and her life and her activity.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Well, we have to leave it at that for this morning.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   But this principle is so important, I felt that I had to give much time to it.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   It's no longer a matter of works. It's now a matter of fruit.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   We are his workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus unto good works. That's the way.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It's always the man himself, he must become light in the Lord.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And when he does become light in the Lord, he will begin to produce the fruit.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Isn't it the tragedy of the modern church that she is full of works and activity and activism,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   but that there is such little fruit, this glorious fruit of the light and of the Spirit to be seen amongst us?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Let's be clear then that our fundamental conceptions are straight and are clear and are true.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And let us realize that we are these branches of the vine that are meant to produce fruit to his glory. Amen.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
