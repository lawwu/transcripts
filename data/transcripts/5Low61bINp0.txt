[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   We have an email today from Jonathan Edwards, who lives in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.780]   That is his real name, I checked, and his question is a good one.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.740]   "Pastor John, I drive a forklift in a warehouse for Christian family businesses.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.860]   We are allowed to listen in our trucks to music, books, and I recently started enjoying
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.340]   this podcast.
[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.200]   I have been an avid audiobook listener at my job, and I would like to know your thoughts
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.040]   about interacting with secular literature, including fiction, philosophy, poetry, and
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   history.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.200]   What would you say, Pastor John, to Jonathan Edwards?"
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.320]   Okay, Jonathan, here's my most recent thinking about why a measured use of wide reading,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.440]   including non-Christian authors, is a wise thing.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.700]   I call it the reality factor.
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.920]   When I'm reading the Bible, there are dozens and dozens of experiences and concepts and
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.440]   words that I can fly right over without pausing to contemplate the reality behind the words
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.040]   and the experiences and the concepts.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.400]   That's what I mean by the reality factor.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.760]   We need to stop bringing the reality factor and go deeper behind.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:27.240]   Now, how do you contemplate a reality without some knowledge of the reality?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.840]   Not knowledge of the word, but of the reality.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.280]   I would say the more knowledge of the reality, the better, if the knowledge is true and in
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.160]   true proportion to its value.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.280]   For example, you don't need to know lots of knowledge about the size and species of
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.520]   the birds that Jesus says to watch in Matthew 6, "Consider the birds of the air."
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.500]   That's not core relevant to what he's saying, but his aim in that text is to help you be
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.360]   free from the experience of anxiety.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.840]   Now, what if you had no experience of anxiety?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.720]   It's really important to have deep, wide knowledge of the reality of anxiety and how
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.160]   it works and what its roots are and what its fruits are and what forms it can take in life
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.360]   and how it can sneak up on you and what devastation it's had in the history of people's lives
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.640]   and on and on and on.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.720]   In other words, there are many realities in the Bible which assume that from life experience,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.480]   we know what they're referring toâ€”peace, joy, fear, anger, war, deception, beauty,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.520]   power, hypocrisy.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.440]   Of course, the Bible gives crucial insight into these things that come from nowhere else,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.680]   but the raw material of knowledge is gained in large measure from life experience, and
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.520]   then the Bible takes that common fund of human experience, of reality that we bring to the
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.400]   Bible and shows how God relates to it and transforms it.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.640]   The New Testament assumes that we have not forgotten the lesson of the book of Proverbs,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.360]   that we should go to the ant, the little bug, the ant, consider her ways and be wise.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.720]   In other words, look at the world.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.480]   Learn reality from the world.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.400]   Learn something about hard work from the world.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.920]   Learn something about perseverance from the world.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   Grow your fund of reality experience of a thousand things that are in the world, because
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.360]   when the New Testament mentions those things, it assumes we have some experiential knowledge
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   of them.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.240]   But here's the catch.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.540]   Most of us live lives that are so small, narrow, constricted, limited.
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.120]   We know so little about so many things.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.880]   One of the ways, only one, one of the ways that God has ordained for us to grow in our
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.080]   knowledge of many things, many experiences that we have no immediate experience of is
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.920]   through reading.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:34.160]   This means that if we have a wide and deep knowledge of things through reading as well
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.880]   as through life experience, then when the Bible speaks, for example, of the sorrow of
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.200]   losing 10 children, we may have a greater understanding of what it's referring to.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.440]   I'm thinking of Job, what it's referring to if we walked through it ourselves, which most
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.600]   of us won't.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.500]   Hardly anybody loses 10 children all at once.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.100]   But we might read about it.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.920]   We might read the various kinds of horrible things that people have walked through like
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.160]   that and deepen our grasp of the human spirit and the experience of what it's like to do
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   that.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.520]   So let me give you just a little glimpse of how this worked for the original Jonathan
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.800]   Edwards.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   Jonathan Edwards delivered a sermon about slavery to sin and what it's like to have
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.240]   Satan as a slave master.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.320]   Now, he knows that Satan is the most wicked, cruelest, most fiendish master that ever was.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.040]   And yet most people gladly walk in his service.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.080]   How could Edwards feel this as he ought?
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.400]   How could he know the reality of what it means to be ruled by Satan as he ought?
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   How could he say it in a way that would help others know the reality?
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.220]   Edwards had evidently done some reading about human sacrifice in the country of Guinea.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.160]   And here's what it did for him.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   Here's what he says, "Satan and his cohorts do by you as I have heard they do in Guinea,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.200]   where at their feasts they eat men's flesh.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.960]   They set the poor ignorant child who knows nothing of the matter to make a fire.
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.600]   And while he stoops down to blow the fire, one comes behind and strikes off his head
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.360]   and then is roasted by the same fire that he kindled and made a feast of.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.760]   And the skull is made use of as a cup out of which they make merry with their liquor,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.560]   just so Satan, who has a mind to make merry with you."
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.800]   Now, that's pretty horrible, pretty powerful, pretty unforgettable.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:10.880]   Edwards got that knowledge of evil from outside the Bible, and it informed biblical teaching
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:20.720]   about Satan's horrible, fiendish, devastating, murderous rule over his people, all the while
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.520]   making them think they're having fun.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.460]   Now, in my case, I just finished listening to all three volumes of William Manchester's
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.200]   biography of Winston Churchill, about a thousand pages each.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:45.360]   What an education in reality, insights into natural challenges of leadership, insights
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.120]   into the horrors of war, insights into fickle nature of public approval, insight into sexual
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.160]   insanity of upper-class philandering, insight into the complexities of what justice looks
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.640]   like in public policy, insight into the value of never giving up, though there's enormous
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.000]   opposition, and on and on and on.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.600]   What an education.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.280]   I was learning reality.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.640]   I wasn't learning my morality.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.160]   Books didn't teach morality.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.520]   I wasn't learning my morality.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.920]   I get that from the Bible.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.480]   I was gaining awareness of realities that come from life experience, except I don't
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.640]   have any life experience of being in war.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.520]   Things that are and what they're like, that's what I found.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:43.920]   In other words, I was enlarging the raw material of reality, which the Bible assumes and interprets
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.800]   for me when I bring it to my reading.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.080]   So what's the aim of all this reading?
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.800]   All of our reading, whether it's Christian or non-Christian, all of our reading aims
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:06.000]   to know God better, to know man better, to know the ways of God and the ways of man better,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.760]   to understand the Scriptures better, that we may obey more fully what God says and be
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.280]   more useful in accomplishing His purposes and glorifying His name.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   Amen.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.600]   Okay, well, in representing APJ listeners, I know they would want me to ask you this.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.840]   How long did it take for you to get through all three Churchill audiobooks?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   I'm trying to think when I started.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.400]   Sometime in the spring, maybe six months, maybe five months, I'm not sure.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.000]   When it ended, I felt sad.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.360]   I really felt sad because they were so satisfying to listen to because of the reality that they
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.680]   were exposing me to so many things I didn't know anything about.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.640]   It was like reading the history of World War II, and of course, it was a biography of the
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.640]   man.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.400]   It was a primer in political science.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.760]   I mean, it was the most remarkable read, probably the most amazing thing I've ever read in terms
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:58.760]   of scope.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.600]   Well, there you have it, listeners, a mammoth reading goal for 2017, perhaps.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.600]   It's certainly a classic.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.520]   Once again, the Churchill biography is written by William Manchester.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.560]   It's titled The Last Lion.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.160]   It's 3,000 pages long, divvied up into three volumes, Visions of Glory, Alone, and finally,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.240]   Defender of the Realm.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.200]   For those of you who listen to this podcast at work or on your commute or as just part
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   of your daily routine, we want to thank you for making us a part of your day.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.760]   We hope you find a number of other wonderful podcasts to mix into your life.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.480]   Of course, we pray that you find some great audiobooks too.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.760]   We know there are a lot of listeners out there like Jonathan Edwards somewhere in Kalamazoo
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   right now.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   So, thanks, Jonathan.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.720]   And to you, we want to say thank you for listening to the podcast and for your prayers, which
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.400]   are always appreciated, and of course, for your financial generosity that supports everything
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.200]   that we do at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   We'll be back on Wednesday.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.500]   We'll see you then.
