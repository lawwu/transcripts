[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   What are the kind of high level framework,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.920]   how people can start to make time?
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.520]   - Make time is this framework that Jake and I created
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.040]   and it's comprised of four different categories
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.720]   or four steps.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.920]   The first is highlight.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060]   It's this idea that you should identify
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880]   the single most important thing
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560]   that you wanna spend time on.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.920]   The second step is laser.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.860]   This is really about setting up these barriers
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.640]   to distraction, changing the defaults
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.180]   around the technology that you use
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.480]   so that you can maintain laser-like focus
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.080]   on your highlight, on that one thing you've identified.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.360]   The third part is energize.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560]   It's all about simple ways to reset
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.600]   some of the more physical defaults in our world
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.160]   so that we can have more energy,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.020]   so that we can pay better attention,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.240]   we can make really good use of that time in those moments.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   The final part of make time, the final step, is to reflect.
