[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   This fall Desiring God will be hosting a national conference titled, "The Romantic
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.320]   Rationalist, God, Life, and Imagination in the Work of C.S. Lewis." The conference
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.680]   will be held in Minneapolis on September 27, 28, and 29, and speakers will include
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   you of course, Pastor John, along with Phil Reichen, Randy Alcorn, Doug Wilson,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.240]   Kevin Van Hooser, and others. So Pastor John, why a national conference this year
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000]   in honor of C.S. Lewis's legacy?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.480]   November 22, 2013 marks 50 years since C.S. Lewis died in 1963, same day that John Kennedy
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:53.200]   died, same day that Aldous Huxley died, and that is the reason for this particular year.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:02.640]   But behind the occasion is the man and his extraordinary influence in so many different
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.560]   ways. This fall, in November, on the 22nd, he will be honored by having a memorial put
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.280]   in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey, along with the likes of Geoffrey Chaucer,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.760]   Charles Dickens, Robert Browning, William Shakespeare, Herbert Spencerâ€”an extraordinary
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   thing for a 20th century Christian apologist, writer of fiction, scholar of medieval literature
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.080]   to receive. J.K. Rowling, who of course wrote the Harry Potter series, if you go to her
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.440]   Wikipedia website, she talks about the influence of Lewis on her as a child, and then on her
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.680]   writing of those phenomenally popular works. And everybody today now, amazingly, because
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.400]   of the movies, has heard of J.R.R. Tolkien, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and Tolkien
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.160]   was an inveterate perfectionist who never could get anything published, and Lewis recognized
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.040]   the skills, the power of his storytelling ability. He recommended him for a Nobel Prize
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.920]   and he encouraged him along, and so in a sense you could say that Lewis is kind of the grandfather
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   of the Tolkien Lord of the Rings series that everybody loves these days. He was a writer
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.600]   of fiction in his own right because of the Chronicles of Narnia, 100 million copies sold
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.160]   in 47 languages, three successful movies, not as successful as The Lord of the Rings,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.640]   but still remarkable influence in the 21st century of a man who considered that his work,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.920]   he thought his works would be forgotten within five years. So not only was he a writer of
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.040]   fiction and has an ongoing legacy that way, but he was probably most known for the past
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.920]   60, 70 years as a Christian defender of the faith, an apologist for ordinary folks. His
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.080]   book Mere Christianity has sold in the millions. CT, Christianity Today, ranked it third among
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.800]   the most influential Christian books since 1945, I think. He made famous that liar, lunatic
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.360]   Lord trilemma, it's called, where Jesus Christ cannot be viewed as merely the ordinary, upright,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.640]   moral teacher minus divinity because he said so many crazy things so that he was either
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.120]   a liar when he said before Abraham was I am, or he was a lunatic, Lewis said, on the level
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   of a man who thought he was a poached egg. And so let's have none of this nonsense about
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.800]   how we love the moral teachings of this wonderful man when he in fact should be in a sane asylum
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.680]   or in prison because of his lying immorality or his lunacy if you don't think he's Lord.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.760]   That was the amazing impact that he had in Christian apologetics. And it was an enormous
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:17.200]   influence on Christians, people like me. I mean, I would put Lewis in the top five people
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.240]   on the planet who have influenced me. And the folks that are coming to this conference,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.760]   I don't know if they talk like that. I think Doug Wilson talks even more lavishly. He said,
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.600]   I heard him say that C.S. Lewis has had a greater impact on him than the sum of all
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   the other writers he has ever read. I mean, that's just stunning when you think what Wilson
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.040]   has read. And then I know Randy Alcorn in his fiction is profoundly influenced, and
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   Kevin Van Hooser, we're going to hear some surprising things from him, I think, with
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.480]   regard to the theological way that imagination works that come over from Lewis, and Phil
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:03.720]   Ryken as a president of an institution loves C.S. Lewis. So we're doing this conference,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.240]   Tony, because we have a love affair with this man, and we have a debt to pay.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.680]   Thank you, Pastor John. The date, again, for the conference is September 27, 28, and 29
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.800]   here in Minneapolis, so save those dates. The conference is titled "The Romantic Rationalist,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.560]   and Life and Imagination in the Work of C.S. Lewis." More details and registration information
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.720]   will be available soon at DesiringGod.org on the blog and under the events tab. I'm
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.200]   your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
