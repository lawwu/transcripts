[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.240]   It's Friday here at Radical Personal Finance and that means Q&A.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.960]   Good Friday to all of you, my radical friends.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.400]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.000]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.720]   My name is Joshua Sheets and today on the show we do a live Q&A.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.800]   I've got the phone lines open.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.440]   I've got three callers on the line.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.440]   It's going to be fun.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:53.480]   Let's see if we can learn together.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.840]   Whenever I possibly can due to my personal travel schedule, et cetera, and simple logistics,
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.520]   I always try to do on Friday a live Q&A show.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.680]   Basically it works like talk radio.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.960]   You get a phone number, you call in and I go live to the call.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960]   I try to make these calls very open.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.360]   I don't screen them in advance.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200]   All I do is jump on real quick as we're getting ready to record and see who's calling.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.320]   I get a quick idea of the questions but I don't screen them.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   This is the best way.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.280]   If you want to ask me about anything in the world or talk about anything in the world,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   this is the best way to get through.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.480]   I do screen out the callers based upon those who support the show on Patreon.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.520]   These calls are open to those of you who voluntarily choose to support me and pay me money through
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.940]   the Patreon program.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.680]   If you're interested in doing that, I would welcome you to do that and would be deeply
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.600]   appreciative of your doing so.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.120]   You can do that at RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.840]   Once you sign up there to support the show, at that point in time you have the opportunity
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.920]   to gain access to the time and the phone number to be able to join a call like this.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.760]   Let's start with Erica in New Hampshire.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   Erica Friedman Oh, thank you, Joshua.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.160]   You've already served me so much.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   By following a lot of the things that you've spoken about on the podcast and some that
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.520]   we haven't followed, my husband actually lost his job of almost 13 years this past fall,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.800]   28 days shy of vesting for retirement because of a Facebook post.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.400]   That actually left us in a bit of a surprise.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Yes, ouch.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.680]   It left us very surprised, but thanks to a lot of things we've reexamined over the last
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.200]   few years and becoming pretty diligent in YNAB, we just said, "Oh, okay.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.200]   Then we're going to go on vacation."
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.840]   We packed up a car to go visit family in California and drive cross-country.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.200]   We ended up actually getting a job before we'd even left New York State.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   We're already back on the bandwagon, but because of all of this, we have a pretty sizable 401(k)
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.240]   that we want to put to work.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.000]   We are looking at doing a self-directed IRA.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   I actually was a market professional for over a decade.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.680]   His best friend and the godfather of our children does real estate in San Diego.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.000]   We've been looking at getting rental properties out there and having a nice sizable chunk
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.640]   of cash that could buy a duplex outright.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.400]   It seems like it might be a really nice opportunity to put the self-directed IRA into a duplex
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.080]   and then take that income from the rent later on when we need to take the distribution.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   I don't know if there's any taxation issues that we might run into, though, when it comes
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.440]   time to pass to our kids.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.920]   Let's talk about that in just a minute.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.560]   But I just want to ask more about the story.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.800]   Your husband was fired because he wrote a Facebook post that his employer considered
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.960]   to be offensive or against corporate policy, something like that?
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.360]   Yes.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.400]   In a private group on Facebook, he wrote a post that "did not represent company value."
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Interesting.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.920]   He was fired for that reason.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.440]   Was this industry-related or was this related to personal, political, religious, or ideological
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.440]   opinions?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   Second Amendment opinion.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   Interesting.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:14.720]   He's made very sure not to comment publicly about anything that is within his field that
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.120]   would come back negatively towards his company or any other company.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   This is...
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120]   No criticism of FDA.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   Right, right, right.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.960]   Interesting just because this is such a...
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.240]   I see this happening, but I see very little reporting on the subject.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.960]   And so whenever I have an opportunity to talk to somebody about it, then it was just good
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.680]   to hear some of the personal anecdotes.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.160]   I've watched this for a number of years and just in terms of seeing either the public
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.680]   censorship or the specific outright firing of people for expressing opinions.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   And do you think was the company...
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.080]   How do you think the company was tipped off if it was in a private Facebook group?
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   Is there any...
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.360]   Do you have any opinion or thoughts on how that may have happened?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   I don't know.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.520]   It's possible that it could be a former friend that didn't like that he didn't apologize
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.480]   appropriately for something he had said.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.640]   But I think it's more likely that being...
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.520]   The retirement policies changed at his company since the time when he was hired.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   And no, it's not the same years of service plus age anymore.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   And so he was one of the few young people, younger people who was close to retirement.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.800]   And I think it's because the fact that he was fired 28 days before he was fully back.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.360]   So we left almost $100,000 on the table because he was fired.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.160]   Is there a legal case there?
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.640]   We're looking at age discrimination because the company is based in California and age
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.480]   discrimination is an issue there for anyone over 40.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   But it's a challenge.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.560]   It is one that we're going to pursue, but it's challenging.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.360]   It's going to take a lot of time.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   And it's always a balance of is it worth pursuing in terms of the emotional turmoil, the financial
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.920]   cost for the actual financial outcome?
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   Well, interesting.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.040]   My advice, and I say this very advisedly, what I recommend to people is in today's world,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.280]   don't ever put anything in writing in any form that you are not content to see published
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.320]   on the front page of a newspaper.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.660]   And I mean in any form.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.600]   Whether that's on Facebook, whether that is on your personal wall – actually, don't
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.800]   call it a wall anymore – on your personal timeline, on your personal page, on your personal
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   website.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.400]   Don't put it in a private group.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.360]   Don't put it in a Facebook message.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.320]   Don't communicate with somebody in writing in a text message.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.800]   Anything you put in writing very quickly is screenshotted and captured.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.040]   And it's a significant, significant risk.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.680]   I'm frequently disturbed at the risk that people expose themselves to based upon their
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.120]   written communication.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.520]   And I think that we should all pay careful attention.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   And I want to encourage people to speak their mind.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:08.520]   Unfortunately, however, you've got to do so advisedly given that many companies demand
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.680]   ideological conformity or – and there are certain standards that if you don't follow
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.440]   them, then it's going to happen.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.520]   So I support the right of employers to discriminate on any basis that they choose to.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.040]   That's not the law.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.560]   But I support the right of employers to be able to hire and fire as they think is appropriate.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.320]   But I think it's important that we consider carefully the impact of our words.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.800]   But I'm glad that you are able to, number one, use it as an opportunity to travel a
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   little bit.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.920]   I think that's one of the best strategies to use is when – if you're – hopefully
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.600]   – many people in the wake of a firing, it's such an emotional bit of turmoil that they
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.320]   can't easily relax.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.520]   But whenever you leave a job or whenever you're laid off from a job, use that as a nice chance
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.400]   to move on – to take a little mini sabbatical, a mini break, a vacation, take some travel.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   Financially, if you can – you just check your numbers and make sure you're financially
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.480]   secure and then use it to bounce on to the next opportunity.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.080]   So that is – that sounds really good.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.640]   I'm really thankful that you're in such a good position.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.600]   Didn't that change – were you and he earlier in your lives – were you ever fired from
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.360]   a job or laid off from a job when you felt much less secure?
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   Was it a different experience when that happened?
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.600]   This is his first job after getting his doctorate.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.440]   I worked in the financial industry.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.520]   So the idea of being laid off was not a surprise for me.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.160]   It happened to me several times.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   I just remember.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.720]   As the normal course of business.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.880]   It did come to a shock to him especially because his dad served his whole career at one company
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   as well.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.000]   So he was still in the mindset of company loyalty which unfortunately seems to have
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   gone extinct.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.440]   I remember the time that I was laid off from a job and I – when it happened, I was – it
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.600]   was – I had always – I realized in the wake of it, I had adopted this idea which
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.200]   I think many of us share that the only reason that you're going to be laid off from a
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.520]   job is because you've done something wrong.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.360]   And even though I probably would have disavowed that idea if asked about it, I would have
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.880]   said, "No, you could be laid off from a job if not doing something wrong."
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.400]   I probably would have been a little bit more arrogant in my private thoughts and think,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.560]   "Well, I'm better than that.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   I'm better than the other person."
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.000]   When I got laid off from the job I was doing a decade ago, it was just out of the blue.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.480]   I had no inkling it was coming.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.160]   I had no expectation it was coming.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:44.120]   And I remember just being so shocked and surprised in the sense of, "Wait a second.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.600]   This is happening to me?
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600]   I'm a star employee.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.520]   I'm Mr. Hard Worker.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.160]   How is this happening to me?"
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.240]   That I just remember laughing and the little anecdote that I usually share in the story,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   a number of years previously I had studied Dave Ramsey's courses and one of the things
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.800]   that he did in his iteration of his Financial Peace University at that time is he talked
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.840]   about how if you're out of debt and you have a fully funded emergency fund, you can laugh
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.880]   in the face of the person who's laying you off and you can say, "How big is the severance?"
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.560]   In the sense of take this bad thing and turn it into a good thing.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.000]   When I finally realized what was happening as I was sitting there in the meeting, then
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.440]   I literally did that.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.200]   I laughed and I snorted and I said, "How big is the severance?"
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:39.080]   Because I was so nervous and I remember to this day, both the president and the CEO who
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.400]   were in the meeting were taking it back and saying, "Well, it's three months but why
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   do you ask?"
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.400]   Then I explained, "Well, I'm sorry.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.440]   I've worked really hard to be in a position where financially I'm prepared for this event
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.160]   and I didn't mean to be rude."
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.360]   But it was definitely a sobering experience and a very humbling experience.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:04.760]   I think it's challenging for many people to keep a positive self-esteem out of that.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.480]   I'm glad he's found another opportunity and I'm glad that it has worked out.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   Back to the self-directed IRA, is there any reason why you think this is not a good path
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   for you to pursue based upon your personal experience, your comfort level with the approach
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.760]   and the potential partners that you may involve in the process?
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.440]   I think it seems like an amazing opportunity to me.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.720]   My husband's best friend, our friend's godfather, does a huge amount of property.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   His brother is a real estate attorney and his dad has a huge amount of properties as
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   well.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.440]   We're pretty much in the family queue for whenever there's a good property and they're
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:52.280]   not ready to buy because they stack up the cash first, then we'd be put in line.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.640]   Also, in the asset, in lieu of having a life insurance to provide care for our kids, he
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.800]   said that having properties there, the income it will generate is more than enough for their
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.280]   care and for everything else as well, should the worst happen to both of us.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.200]   My biggest concern is just, I have a friend who's relatively new to the financial industry
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.920]   and he said that there's huge taxation issues with inheriting IRAs.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.840]   I've just been so busy I haven't had a chance to look into that myself and that's my one
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.080]   stumbling block at this point.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.600]   So specifically, based upon the scenario you're describing, it sounds to me like an ideal
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.240]   use of a self-directed IRA.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.920]   You've got the money, it gives you a large amount of investment dollars available, you
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.680]   have experience and competence in the realm of investing, you can do your due diligence,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.240]   you have the personal connection that is trustworthy.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.560]   I mean that checks all the boxes.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.520]   From my perspective, that checks all the boxes as far as the use of a self-directed IRA.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:59.080]   I think that's an ideal solution and especially with the inside connection on real estate
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.960]   and the fact that you and he are more sophisticated in your knowledge.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.520]   He's got a PhD, you have advanced education, you have experience in the financial industry.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.400]   I think these are all important things that would lend a measure of sophistication to
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.560]   your personal approach.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   As far as taxation, I don't know what that person would be referring to.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.760]   IRA taxation is extremely standardized and it's the same – you're going to face
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.440]   the same – to my knowledge, you're going to face the same taxation whether you're
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   dealing with real estate in a self-directed IRA or whether you are dealing with stocks
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.320]   in a mutual fund portfolio.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.240]   In essence, the taxation is this.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.680]   As the money grows, of course that tax will be directed to the future.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.400]   Starting at the age of 70 and a half, the IRA will need to start to make required minimum
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.080]   distributions.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.480]   You would want to make sure that the account given the real estate could actually disperse
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.440]   the cash for those required minimum distributions.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.280]   Of course you can take however much you need out of it for retirement or you can keep it
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.080]   as an asset for the benefit of your children.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.360]   The downside to a traditional IRA, which is what this would be, given that he's going
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.660]   from a 401(k) to an IRA, the downside of course is those required minimum distributions.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.280]   If you don't need that money, it can be annoying to have to take those out and that
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.880]   could be a challenge in the world of real estate, especially if you had a property-intensive
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.260]   portfolio but you didn't have the actual cash coming out of it.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.840]   With regard to taxation when he dies, of course generally you would be the beneficiary if
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.160]   he were to pre-decease you.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.320]   But let's assume that both of you die.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:51.480]   If you leave the account as an asset for your children, then they would receive it under
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.520]   the standard rules and those rules would be either they could take the money out very
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.120]   quickly – they could of course have access to the full amount at any time – and they
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.920]   would – or they could turn it into a stretch IRA where they could take the assets out over
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.640]   the course of their lifetime, which is a great way to do it.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:19.320]   Now I guess perhaps the only consideration that he may be referring to would be that
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:27.560]   the taxation would be at income rates rather than dividends or profit from the ownership
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.000]   of real estate.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.080]   Perhaps that's the difference that he's referring to.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.320]   And frankly, having never done a transaction like that, I would need to research that.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.800]   I don't know if that would be what the fear is.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.520]   The fear would be of course that if you have a normal property and you leave it behind
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.120]   as – in fact, here I've talked to myself.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.680]   This must be what he's talking about.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.560]   In general, if you and your husband buy a house and you pay $200,000 for this investment
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:04.200]   property, it grows over the course of your lifetime and then when you die, it sells – your
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.560]   heir is inherited at $600,000 of value.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.520]   At that time, if you own the property in the standard way, that property, because it's
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:18.000]   long-term capital gain property, would receive a step-up in tax basis and your children would
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.040]   be able to inherit it with a $600,000 basis, which they could then turn, sell for $600,000
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.280]   and they would incur no income tax on the property.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   Whereas if you put it into – if you purchase the property in the context of your IRA, then
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.720]   at that point in time, they would be receiving it as ordinary income property.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.840]   And since we're getting money that's never been taxed and they're inheriting the money
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.000]   that's never been taxed, they're going to have to pay ordinary income tax rates on
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   the money.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.760]   So if you bought the $200,000 property today, it grows in the IRA.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:59.280]   You die, they receive $600,000 and it comes with the income tax bill on a $600,000 worth
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.240]   of income for them when they take the money out.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.520]   So my guess would be that that's the problem that your friend is referring to.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.600]   My answer to that would be, of course, I want to have that long-term capital gains property,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.340]   but that wouldn't necessarily be enough of a reason for me to walk away from pursuing
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:27.520]   a self-directed IRA because the capital being available is valuable.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.960]   You would just need to make sure the deal is going to get you returns that are in excess
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.880]   of other investment opportunities that you have.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.160]   So that would be my best analysis of what he's saying and why he's saying it.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   Okay.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.320]   And then with that, if it was one where they spread the distributions over their life,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   then it would get taxed at each distribution instead of in one chunk at our death?
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   And this is really powerful.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.440]   This is one of the big benefits of IRAs.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.680]   Roth IRAs are superior here, but it's one of the big benefits of IRAs.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.040]   If you leave an account balance behind to a descendant, to your children, your grandchildren,
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:11.120]   keep it simple, then they have to take the money out, but they have a couple of different
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.200]   choices on how quickly they can take it out.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.080]   They have required minimum distributions as well.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:22.800]   And so this is loosely called a stretch IRA in the vernacular of financial planning, although
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.200]   it's not actually – that's not actually a technical term.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.500]   What it means is you take it out over the longest period possible.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:39.280]   So if I, as a 30-year-old son, inherit a $100,000 or a million-dollar IRA from my dad or my
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.120]   mom, then I can just take the required minimum distributions from that over the course of
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.560]   my entire lifetime.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.280]   And so there's an IRS table that calculates based upon life expectancy.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.920]   So I don't remember the number, but let's say that the life expectancy for me as a 30-year-old
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.480]   would be an additional 60 years of life.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.080]   Well, if I take a million-dollar portfolio, I just need to take out one-sixtieth of that
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.720]   account as at the age of 30.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.800]   And then the rest of the money continues to accrue with no taxation.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.840]   It continues to maintain the character of the IRA account, which means that the taxation
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.960]   is deferred.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.560]   And so it continues to build and to build and to build.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.180]   And then if it's a traditional IRA, I just go ahead and take the money and I pay income
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.940]   taxes on whatever my distribution is in that year.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.360]   Now this is more powerful with a Roth IRA and this is one of the reasons why Roth IRAs
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.800]   can be such a valuable estate planning tool for people who have them, because Roth IRAs
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.040]   don't have required minimum distributions for a retiree.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.720]   So if somebody is wealthy and they don't need the money, then the money can continue to
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.000]   grow tax-deferred from say age 70 to age 90 at a natural death.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.640]   And then the child can continue to maintain it and they receive the money over that same
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.760]   distribution schedule, but they still receive the money income tax-free.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.120]   And so it's more powerful in a Roth IRA because Roth IRAs can be left alone for longer because
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.240]   they don't have required minimum distributions.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.400]   But it's still powerful for anybody who inherits an IRA from their parents or grandparents
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.120]   and they don't need the money.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.040]   They can stretch those distributions out and wind up getting much more money out of it
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.240]   because the account stays invested and invested tax efficiently.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240]   Okay.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.480]   And can I ask one more twist on that as well?
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   Go ahead.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:38.160]   So we've used pretty much the whole amount in the self-directed IRA for a property.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.160]   And then because we'd probably have to pay cash because that self-directed IRA can't
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.240]   take out a loan in years, because now that my husband is in the startup world, in years
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.480]   where he doesn't have an income, can we take those proceeds within the self-directed IRA
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.120]   and roll some of that into a Roth IRA?
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.840]   Or am I just going completely off the charts here?
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.000]   I wish I – there are a number of businesses that peak my radical proclivities and this
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.020]   is one of them.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:15.520]   The world of custodianship for self-directed investment accounts, it lights my fires because
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.680]   it's so interesting to me the things that could be done.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:26.600]   I don't see any reason why – in my knowledge, I don't see any reason why it's not possible
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.040]   conceptually.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:38.080]   For example, I don't know why you couldn't establish an LLC and then have the IRA own
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:46.580]   the units of that LLC and then just simply transfer those from an IRA to a Roth IRA when
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.580]   you needed to.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.080]   I don't know any reason why legally it wouldn't be possible.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.320]   My guess would be that just practically is it worthwhile.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.840]   But if you – because conceptually that's exactly – and the reason is conceptually
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   that's exactly what would happen if you were to say purchase shares of an existing
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.760]   publicly traded REIT, a real estate investment trust.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.400]   That's what somebody else is doing.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.960]   They have established a REIT.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.440]   They're issuing shares of that REIT.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.160]   You purchase those shares within a traditional IRA and then when you convert from a traditional
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.200]   IRA to a Roth IRA, you're basically just transitioning those shares from a traditional
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.040]   IRA to a Roth IRA.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.240]   So I don't know why it wouldn't be possible conceptually to do that with your own private
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   holdings.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.880]   Many of these companies that will work and serve as custodians for your self-directed
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.680]   accounts will allow you to mingle various self-directed funds.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.920]   So you could – in these accounts, you could have a self-directed educational savings account.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.400]   You can have a self-directed health savings account and you can have a self-directed 401(k)
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.320]   or self-directed IRA.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.880]   And essentially, they market this under what they call the checkbook LLC and you can just
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:08.040]   simply have one checkbook and then the shares of your ownership of that entity are owned
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.980]   by these different accounts that you have.
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.840]   So my answer is I don't know why it couldn't be done conceptually.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.480]   But practically speaking, I don't know if the custodians will service that.

[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.040]   It's one of those areas where I'd love to do more and I've been remiss in not doing
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.800]   more discussion of self-directed investing on the show.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Anything else, Erica?
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   That's it.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.480]   After I get big into it, maybe we can get into it together for an episode.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   Absolutely.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.480]   I would love that.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   Let me know.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   Absolutely.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:54.320]   Erica, real quick, since I know we've corresponded outside of this call, tell me briefly – I
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.920]   was going to do a full interview with you on the show about building your own house.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.080]   You've educated yourself a lot in this area as one of the strategies of financial planning
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.960]   and I've been planning to do a standalone show on that but I haven't gotten it done
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   yet.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.240]   Tell me quickly what you learned in pursuing the idea of building your own house, especially
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.680]   as it relates to the financial feasibility and how it's impacted your own plan.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:21.200]   Well, I'm actually getting a tractor for Christmas with a backhoe because we are laying
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.920]   the foundation for it.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.160]   Fortunately, things didn't line up to tear down the house this winter because otherwise
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.000]   we would have been in the tear-down phase right when my husband lost his job.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.720]   So I'm really lucky that everything got pushed out.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   We're looking at the question.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.560]   We were going to partially finance the build but now we're not sure if we're just – we're
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.720]   probably just going to stock all the cash.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.960]   I'm just trying to go through everything we have and get rid of all the excess belongings
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.560]   so we don't have clutter and we're a lot more streamlined.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.640]   And then once I do that I'm going to try and finalize the plans to build the house
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:59.400]   both as economically as comfortable and as basically as multifunctional as possible.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:06.760]   I'm looking at doing the – basically doing buildings in sizes that optimize materials
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.840]   for strength and for open space.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:16.400]   I'm looking at things like putting in a – because it's cold and also taking passive solar design.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.360]   So I'm looking to take a whole bunch of these different pieces but it's kind of hard when
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.960]   you're a perfectionist and you want to try and make it perfect.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.840]   But I've charged myself as soon as I – as soon as I purge everything I can from the
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:35.000]   house I am making these plans and I need to start pricing it out because do that or do
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.360]   some remodels on the house.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.480]   I don't want to pour money into something I'm looking to tear down.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.520]   And you went through the Shelter Institute course up in the Northeast, right?
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   I did.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.400]   It was up in Maine and it was the most amazing class that I've taken.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   I was there.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.640]   I had a pretty extensive background because I was an architecture minor and I've built
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.160]   a few things around CR, a big chicken coop and a few other things.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.480]   And there were people who had no idea at all.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.360]   So for me I was able to look into it and get a PhD level look when I asked clarifying and
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   furthering questions.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.080]   And then there were other people that just became acquainted through it.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   It was great.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.720]   We got to go through all different aspects of the build, septic systems, electrical systems,
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.480]   all sorts of things.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.320]   And also got to have a field day when we got to play with some backhoes and bulldozers
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.160]   on the farm that the founder has.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.960]   It's actually a family company.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.800]   And so there was a father running a good part of the lectures and daughters and sons all
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   there as part of the team and just helping with a really holistic look at it.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.000]   And also the understanding that sometimes you're still going to specialize even if you're
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.920]   going to do everything you can.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.280]   And the mindset of doing everything, just basically the mindset of just trying to do
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.160]   everything that you can do on your own and then asking for help when you need it was
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   fantastic.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.240]   He had a welding class on the Saturday in between the classes for anyone to learn how
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.240]   to weld.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.000]   That's awesome.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.560]   So for those who aren't familiar, the organization that Erica attended is called the Shelter
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   Institute.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's the shelterinstitute.com.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.880]   And they offer various courses at different amounts.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:25.240]   But they bring in people who, as Erica just said, a variety of experience and walk them
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.640]   through the process of here's how you build a house.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   And for those who have the interest and the patience, building your own house can be something
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.600]   – or at least doing much of the work to build your own house could be a really good
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.040]   financial move.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   The biggest challenge is education and then confidence.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.800]   But you can do a lot of things yourselves in the home building process.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.520]   And also depending on the stage of your family, this can be very valuable.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.160]   It's something that when I was about 10 years old, my father went through the process
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.520]   of building our house.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.360]   And he didn't do all of it because he was – he didn't do all of it.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.000]   He was maintaining a full-time 40-hour-a-week job at the time.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.080]   But he did a lot of it and it was a very formative process for me and helpful for me, for my
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   siblings.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.840]   We did a lot of the work ourselves, which was extremely valuable for me to have the
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   experience.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.920]   I was the youngest one so I did the least.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.640]   But for me to have the experience of going through and actually seeing a house built
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   and building it from the ground up, it provided a tremendous amount of interaction between
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:38.520]   my parents and me and my many siblings.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.120]   It was really, really valuable in our family.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.480]   And then it also allowed my parents to build a much bigger house than they would have been
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.160]   able to afford and it solved their housing needs at the time in about the only way that
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.680]   was financially viable.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.240]   They couldn't afford with where we live and the size of our family.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.720]   They couldn't afford to buy the types of houses that would fit us and they couldn't
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:09.360]   afford to bring our whole family together, which was the goal at the time.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.440]   The goal at the time was to – for my parents to be able to build a place where within the
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:20.680]   nature of the house, they could have a house that could accommodate six children and my
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   grandparents living with us.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.200]   And so custom designing and then custom building was the only way that they worked out that
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:34.000]   they could actually build something that would give our family an ideal living space.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   My father is very competent.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He's an engineer.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.120]   He was very competent with his own background and experience to do many of the things.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.200]   But to this day, I value those experiences.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.140]   I value the fact of we put on the roof.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.760]   We did the wiring.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.380]   We didn't do the plumbing but we did all the flooring.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.320]   And so those experiences for children were very, very valuable and it solved a major
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.040]   financial need of our family at the time and was valuable.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.080]   So I think it's something that we've often neglected as a strategy.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.600]   But for – whether for young people, for people with children, you can learn it.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.760]   I remember seeing a story about a very inspiring lady who – she had young children.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.840]   She was a divorced single mom.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.220]   She had young children and I think she lived in an urban environment.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:28.080]   But basically she built her own house with nothing more than the help of YouTube, trying
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.880]   to study things on YouTube and then working on things.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   I've read story after story of people who don't have a lot of money who build slowly.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:42.080]   They used reclaimed materials, salvaged materials and they just simply force themselves to learn
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.760]   the skills that other people have and they're able to build a really beautiful and functional
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.600]   housing for themselves and their families by doing the work themselves.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:59.000]   I would love to see that expand because it seems like it should be that fundamental human
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.320]   ability to build your own house, to craft with your hands, the shelter for yourself
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.280]   and your family should be a standard human skill that we teach all of our children.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   But unfortunately, we have lost it.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.960]   So Erica, keep me in the loop as you work through your project.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.740]   I'd love to hear and then bring you on the show for a full discussion when you guys work
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.080]   out what actually ends up happening.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.080]   We'd love to hear your experiences.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   That would be fantastic.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   Thanks so much, Joshua.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   Absolutely.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.080]   All right, going on to Nick in Indiana.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   Nick, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   Hi there, Joshua.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   It feels weird to hear your voice not at 2X speed because that's how I always listen to
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   your podcasts.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   I hear that constant so much from listeners.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:48.160]   And when I teach a class on a webinar, people say, "Oh, it's weird to hear Joshua's voice
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.160]   at 1X speed."
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   And it makes me all nervous.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   Am I going too slow?
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   Go ahead.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   No, no, no.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   It's not like that.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:02.680]   But anyway, my first question relates to your experience when you were working with planning
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   clients.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.480]   Are there any particular questions that you wish more clients would have asked or information
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.200]   that clients should have brought to your attention to kind of get the most out of your services?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.360]   I know in my work as a doctor, I have patients all the time that kind of avoid talking about
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.840]   a lot of things that I could really help them with.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.800]   And I'd like to avoid that sort of mistake when I seek the services of planners.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.000]   So what can clients do to kind of help their planners help them the most?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Wow, what a fun question.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.760]   Two big themes occur to me right off the bat, and then probably some individual questions
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.800]   specifically.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:53.000]   The first theme that occurs to me would be somebody simply making it clear that they're
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.600]   open to advice in any area.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.200]   Frequently somebody has a stated scope.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.640]   And as a financial planner, one of the things that you try to do is you lay out the scope
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.360]   of the engagement using kind of the formal language.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.960]   What is the scope and nature of our engagement?
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.020]   So if somebody wants a review of their investment portfolio, that's one thing.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.320]   If they want a review of their tax plan, that's another thing.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:20.440]   But if somebody were to talk with me as a financial planner and say, "I'm interested
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.520]   in your thoughts in a review of my, say, life insurance policy," then that doesn't necessarily
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.960]   give me permission to start talking to them about their plans for their child's education.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.560]   Now on Radical Personal Finance, I can do that, and I do that very freely.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:41.220]   But in a professional context, that generally is not accepted.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.020]   So the first thing that somebody could do is if they're interested in holistic advice
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:52.060]   or holistic input, then they can make that clear to a planner.
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.980]   And just by simply saying something like, "By the way, as we talk about this, I want
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.960]   you to know that I'm interested in anything you have to say or any insight that you have
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.280]   about any other aspects of my financial situation."
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.400]   And a way that they could do that practically would be to be clear about everything that
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   they have.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.120]   Instead of being secretive, they could just say, "Here's what I have.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   I have this here.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.960]   I have this other thing here as well."
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:23.520]   Now, of course, you as a client would need to balance the need for privacy in those things.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.080]   I've talked about that elsewhere on the show.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.680]   But in general, most people, you don't have to protect every single thing, and just being
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.540]   straightforward with it helps a lot.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:40.880]   For a financial planner, a financial planner is in an interesting relationship with a client
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.980]   where much as you, Nick, as a doctor, you – there's a bit of – you have to have
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.220]   a certain amount of respect.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.820]   As a doctor, you can ask your client to say, "Take off your clothes," when it's an
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.760]   appropriate time for your personal examination to tell them, "Take off your clothes."
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.120]   But if you told every single one of your clients right when they come in, "Go ahead and take
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.080]   off your clothes," that would obviously be a breach of trust.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:12.000]   It's not strictly necessary when someone has a problem in their throat.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.680]   And so financially speaking, it's a similar scenario.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.240]   Not everybody wants to get financially naked with their financial planner.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.360]   But yet if they did, it would make it a little easier.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:27.640]   And so the metaphorical parallel would be that, Nick, if every patient that you saw
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.160]   would come in, they would do all the vital measurements right off the bat.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.280]   They would do blood panels and have everything right there, a comprehensive portfolio of
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.480]   all their past medical exams, all their history, all their other doctor's comments, and at
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.040]   the risk of pushing this too far and be standing there naked in the waiting room when you come
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.600]   in, you'd probably be much more efficient and much more comprehensive with your advice.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.800]   You look at their diet log for their food log of how they eat, their calorie intake,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   et cetera.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   You'd probably give good advice.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   Well, the closer that you can get with a planner as far as opening things up in that way, that'll
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   help.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.240]   I think that'll really help.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:18.680]   The second kind of major theme that I would see as valuable is forthrightly disclosing
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:28.560]   the opinions that you as a client hold and not hiding those for the sake of professional
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.120]   courtesy.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:39.040]   For example, when I sold life insurance, it's never been a surprise to me that some people
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:46.840]   have strong convictions about what's the appropriate way to buy life insurance policies.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:54.360]   Some people believe very strongly that it would be idiotic to ever purchase a whole
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.960]   life insurance policy or it would be idiotic to ever do anything except buy a 10- or 20-year
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   level term insurance policy for 10 times your annual income.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.900]   As a financial advisor, it's not surprising to me that people believe that.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.000]   But it's much more valuable for me if they would just simply open their mouth and say,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.540]   my belief is that with regard to life insurance, I should only ever buy 10- or 20-year level
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.960]   term insurance policy.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.800]   What do you think about that opinion?
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:32.200]   Because then that would give me the opportunity as a financial professional to say, well,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.560]   here's what I think.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.840]   When I actually interviewed for the very first time with the company that I wound up working
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.600]   with for six years, which was a leader in the area of whole life insurance, this was
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.680]   in whole life insurance sales, so massive amounts of whole life insurance.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:55.200]   I was at that time operating under the deep conviction that buying term life insurance
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.880]   was the only appropriate decision for every thoughtful, reasonable person who wants to
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.960]   make a good financial decision.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:09.320]   So I led with that in my initial interview with the various life insurance agents that
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.880]   I talked to to try to figure out if this was a company that I wanted to associate with.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:18.240]   I said to them, I believe you should only buy term insurance and invest the difference.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.040]   What do you think and why?
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.520]   And then being able to listen to them say, well, here are the advantages of that approach
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.140]   and here are the disadvantages of that approach and here are various scenarios and here's
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.280]   how you would know what's right, helped me to come to a different conclusion than I had
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.400]   previously.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.840]   But what I found is that clients always harbored their own opinions, convictions.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.840]   You should only buy index funds.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.900]   You should only buy term life insurance.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.440]   You should never buy long-term care insurance until you're 55 years old.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.640]   You should always buy disability insurance at your job.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.600]   You should never buy individual stocks.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:56.520]   You should never do anything except – you fill in the blank with whatever that I could
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.420]   pick up on them, but many people didn't have the confidence in their opinion to actually
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.680]   hear my responses.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.080]   And so if they would just simply say, by the way, here's my personal belief.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   What do you think?
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:15.040]   That could get a whole lot of touchy-feely foreplay out of the way and we could get right
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.600]   too and I could say, well, here's what I think about that opinion.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.760]   Here's where I think it's applicable and here is what I personally believe are the downsides.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.160]   So let's talk about your situation and figure out what may or may not be appropriate for
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   you.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.120]   There are going to be two big picture approaches that I think are valuable.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:41.560]   Here would be I guess one more very important one, Nick, that I think also makes a difference.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:49.160]   Many people when meeting with a financial advisor feel the need to be reticent about
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.280]   the actual circumstances that they're going through.
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:40:05.480]   The best example of this would be family problems, family turmoil, marriage problems, et cetera.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.360]   So they often want to pull back and not talk about things that they think are going to
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.520]   be uncomfortable.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.040]   For a while when I was a new advisor, I didn't see it happen and I couldn't understand why
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.240]   did this person not do what I said they should do?
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.240]   I sat with them.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.920]   I listened to them.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.640]   Why did they not implement what I told them they should do?
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.120]   Some people would say no to the recommendations that I made or they would often just disappear
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.040]   and not respond to the recommendations that I made and I didn't understand why.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.080]   I would go back through all the recommendations, through all the notes and I would say, "But
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.500]   this was exactly what they should do.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.320]   My advice is right.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.920]   Based upon everything they said and what they said was important, my advice was right."
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.640]   But as I grew and experienced and matured, I quickly realized that there were frequently
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.960]   things that they wouldn't tell me about and most commonly it was marital strife.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.240]   They would say if I'm meeting with the husband or the wife, they wouldn't want to tell me
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:11.360]   what the husband, their spouse was saying in their actual situation.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.440]   And so later I would find out when I talked to them a year later, well, they had since
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.800]   gotten divorced.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.920]   And if they had just simply told me, then I could have provided some actual useful advice
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.480]   for them and said, "Well, here are a few things that you should do and with regard
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.400]   to your divorce planning and definitely if you are considering consulting a divorce attorney,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.180]   you definitely should not do all of these recommendations that I've made to you, but
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.920]   you should do these other things to protect yourself or protect your wife or etc., to
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.580]   come through this in the most inexpensive and the best possible way for all the outcomes."
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:48.120]   But they didn't want to tell me they were facing marital problems and therefore we basically
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   all wasted our time.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:54.160]   And then I guess a corollary of that would be when I'm in a competitive situation.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.720]   It's no surprise when I'm in a competitive situation with another advisor that I'm in
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.200]   that situation.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.840]   I'm meeting with Joshua and I'm meeting with a firm across town and we're both presenting
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:12.320]   proposals on a $2 million portfolio that we're trying to bring under our stewardship.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   Okay.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   Well, that's fine.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   That's fine competition.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.120]   We know it's a big competition, but let's talk about what you're doing and I'll help
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.440]   you make that decision.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   Here's what we do.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.680]   Here's what we don't do.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.000]   And at least if I know who the competition is and what they're proposing, then I can
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.960]   tell you here are the flaws in it.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:33.520]   Same thing used to happen with insurance policies and one of the little things that was helpful
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.560]   with insurance policies is that when legally speaking, if somebody is seeking to replace
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.180]   a life insurance policy, which means a newly issued policy is seeking to be canceled and
[00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:50.480]   replaced by another contract, legally there has to be a notice made to the company who
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.400]   holds the contract and that company could then notify the agent.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.840]   But frequently the client wouldn't say, "Oh, I'm meeting with this other firm across town
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.920]   and I'm considering replacing your policy with this other company."
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:08.680]   And I often found that so maddening where I would say, for sake of example, "Listen,
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.740]   I can sell you a Prudential policy or I can sell you a MetLife policy or I could sell
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.200]   you a Northwestern Mutual policy or I could sell you a New York Life policy.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.760]   Here's why I've recommended for you policy number one.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.120]   And yes, I understand that this other agent who you met through such and such is recommending
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.640]   to you a MetLife policy instead of my Prudential policy or my Northwestern Mutual policy and
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.800]   here are the advantages of that that they're telling you about, but here's what you don't
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.380]   know that could hurt you."
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.740]   But so frequently people didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me they're in a competitive
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.200]   environment, that I'm in a competitive environment.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.320]   And the only person that was hurt by that was themselves.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:52.480]   So honesty, frankness, and a recognition of the fact that these little questions are not
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   unknown.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.640]   In the same way, Nick, that you're in competition with WebMD and whatever so-and-so says on
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.860]   the nightly news, that's not a surprise to you if I come in and I'm curious, but you
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:09.520]   also have a lot to add that if I'm open to you that I could really gain from.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.760]   So those would be my thoughts in answer to your question.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.280]   Okay, thanks for that, Dr. Huffman.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.720]   That actually sounds remarkably similar to kind of my thoughts on seeing patients.
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:22.640]   So I was going to spin it around on you.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.920]   All those things apply.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.760]   So I was going to spin it around on you and let me just ask you, if you were answering
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:34.720]   that question from the perspective of a medical professional, how would you respond to it?
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:41.160]   I mean, really, most all the things that you said certainly still apply.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:47.920]   You know, one, kind of going back to something you kind of said about people being embarrassed
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:54.160]   about certain situations and things like that, you know, we hear, you know, "What to you
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:58.840]   is a weird, embarrassing, I can't believe this is happening to me situation."
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.720]   We see this stuff all the time.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.920]   So don't be embarrassed to bring something up to your doctor or, you know, as you said,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.520]   you know, if there's trouble at home or, you know, your job is going to get lost, you know,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   don't be embarrassed to talk to your planner about that.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:19.600]   I would imagine, you know, that's kind of one of the big, big things.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:25.680]   And also, you know, the, you know, say up front, you know, here are the issues that
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.200]   I'd like to kind of work on today because, you know, we get so many patients and I've
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:35.000]   certainly been guilty of doing this in the past of, you know, "Oh, hey, I know we're
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.920]   all done here, doctor, but X, Y, and Z as well."
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.120]   Well, okay, you've, you know, just like the divorce situation you talked about, okay,
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.840]   now we're in a completely different situation, you know, maybe that changes everything that
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.880]   I just spent the last 10 minutes talking to you about.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.240]   So yeah, I would certainly say a lot of things you said, but I'm going to add those two things
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:58.520]   on top of, you know, don't be embarrassed about what you've got going on and, you know,
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:03.640]   kind of say everything up front so that we kind of have all the information going in.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:16.560]   I have found that there's a strikingly consistent among the professions, and I'm lumping financial
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:21.200]   planning in with the professions that are more frequently considered, such as the practice
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:26.360]   of law or the practice of medicine, among the professions when I interact with other
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:32.920]   professionals, there's often striking similarities between the different approaches and the things
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.280]   that many of us struggle with.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:43.440]   And I think more than anything, frankness and honesty is usually the most helpful thing.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:49.160]   Sometimes it's hard, frequently it's hard, but forthrightness, honesty, at least there
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.800]   we have the opportunity to make progress.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800]   You had a second question.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.640]   Nick, go ahead with your second question, please.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:02.920]   Yeah, the second relates to switching from a sole proprietorship to an S-corp.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.120]   I've been working as an independent contractor for the last two years, basically just under
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:12.000]   my own name, making about $120,000 a year.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.920]   I am considering switching to an S-corp, and I've been thinking about this for a while,
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.280]   and, you know, with some of the new tax law changes, it looks like that might even be
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.920]   a more attractive option now.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:33.080]   But I'm just wondering if my, you know, what I'm being paid and what I'm doing is not changing,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:39.000]   you know, same jobs, same pay, is that going to kind of trigger the IRS to say, "Hey, you
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.840]   were making $120,000, and now your salary is $90,000, but you're getting these $30,000
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   in dividends.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.520]   Is that going to cause a problem for me, or is that okay to do?"
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:57.960]   So the basic question is, is changing the approach to business, such as entity from
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.400]   sole proprietorship to S-corporation, is that conceivably a red flag that the IRS would
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:09.400]   say, "Hey, by the way, because you're doing this, we're going to give you extra scrutiny
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   to your situation"?
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.000]   Is that an accurate summary of the question?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.400]   Sure, yeah.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:20.080]   I guess it makes more sense if you're kind of starting a whole new business or something
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:24.920]   like that, but for mine, everything else would be staying the same, just how I'm being taxed
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.920]   on it.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   So, yeah.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.920]   Trevor Burrus: Right.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.640]   I don't believe that that is something that is appropriate.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.960]   I think it's – and here would be my more extended answer.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.360]   Number one, I think it's a good idea.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.080]   I am scared of the IRS.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.920]   They have guns, they have men with guns, and they have jails.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:54.160]   I'm scared of people with guns who have the law and all the legal authority of all
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.960]   of the force in the land at their disposal.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:02.160]   So I treat people in that situation with a very healthy amount of respect.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.720]   So I'm scared of the IRS and I recommend that you be too.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.760]   That's something that's very, very important.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:14.160]   And they've cultivated that reputation over the years, especially in the area of tax enforcement.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.320]   Number two, I'm not scared of the IRS because at the end of the day, the IRS doesn't put
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:24.800]   you in jail for just about anything except not reporting income.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.260]   They don't put you in jail because you messed up on your taxes or because you took a deduction
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:36.460]   that you were – that they don't think that you should be allowed to.
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.760]   So on the whole, although I think it's good to be scared of the IRS, you don't think
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.840]   we need to walk around on tiptoes thinking that they're all of a sudden peeking in
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:51.400]   the window and that we should never do anything that might ruffle their feathers.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.800]   I appreciate when people are aggressive with the IRS.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:59.480]   I think they have a moral – that we have a moral duty to push back in any conceivable
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:07.200]   thing and to push back in our own business practices to take every single deduction that
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.200]   is allowable.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.280]   We have a moral duty to make our tax bills as low as possible and then to press back
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:20.960]   in whatever way possible politically to make the overall system of taxation fairer and
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.300]   cheaper as is – in any way that is possible.
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.360]   So that's kind of just a little bit of ideology.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:34.100]   Practically speaking, what you're describing would not raise any red flag whatsoever.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:40.280]   The natural progression of businesses is that they will grow and change over time.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:47.600]   It's natural for businesses to begin as a sole proprietorship, to move into an S-corporation
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.040]   or an LLC and then as they grow to change to a C-corporation.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.760]   So practically that is the normal progression of many businesses and practically there are
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:04.600]   many reasons why that would be very much in your best interest, none of which necessarily
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.400]   relate to tax savings.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.900]   So that is definitely not going to be a red flag.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:17.820]   In addition to that, there is nothing wrong with structuring your affairs in the most
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.840]   tax-efficient way possible.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.940]   There's nothing wrong with it morally and there's nothing wrong with it legally.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.820]   I think that you should morally and legally do both of those things to structure your
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.580]   affairs in the most efficient way possible.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:39.220]   You simply have to pay attention to any stated rules that do exist on what you can and cannot
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:40.380]   do.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:47.020]   So the only danger in pursuing what you're describing would be if you were to ignore
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:54.380]   the rules or the policies that the IRS would follow and enforce with regard to S-corporation
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:52:00.380]   taxation and of course most specifically, practically speaking, to the actual structuring
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:05.180]   of your income with salary versus dividends.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:14.860]   If you move to an S-corporation and you started taking $1 of salary and $119,999 of dividends
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:21.260]   as compared to currently where you have $120,000 of self-employment income, that probably would
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.500]   trigger an audit.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.700]   That probably would trigger the red flags.
[00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.900]   But it's because that's out of the guidelines.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.740]   It's not because it's wrong to go from a sole proprietorship to an S-corporation.
[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.180]   It's because the requirement of an S-corporation is that, especially for professional services,
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.140]   that you're paid a salary commensurate with the salary in the area.
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.660]   So what you should do is you should research what's the salary in the area, figure out
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:52.940]   your scheme of defending that based upon the data that you've gathered in your area of
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.260]   what's an appropriate salary, and then you should set your salary appropriately.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.500]   I think that's the best way to handle it.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:03.340]   But no, making the transition that you're describing is not wrong.
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.980]   Even if it were solely for the savings of tax savings, I don't think that would be a
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:08.980]   problem.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:19.500]   The IRS has a doctrine where if the only reason for making a move is to save on taxes, for
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:23.740]   example, you structure a transaction in a certain way, and if the only reason for doing
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:27.140]   it is to lower your tax bill, they'll disallow that.
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:30.380]   There has to be a compelling business reason.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:38.260]   But changing entity is perhaps the easiest thing to properly, legally, and morally justify
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.780]   as an appropriate business reason.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.060]   And you're not just structuring something to lower your taxes.
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.660]   There are many other benefits that will accrue to you from that perspective.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.780]   So short answer, Nick, don't worry about it.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:54.820]   Be scared of the IRS because, again, they've got the men with guns who will come and back
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:58.060]   them up, and you should be scared of those people.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:02.160]   But don't be scared of the IRS because the time that they show up with guns and the ways
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:08.460]   that they show up with guns are pretty well known, and what you're describing is nowhere
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.900]   near the line of danger.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:11.900]   Good answer?
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   Yep.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.900]   Sounds good.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.900]   All right.
[00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.900]   Very good, sir.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   All right.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.900]   Final caller for the day.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.900]   Let's go to Ruha in Alabama.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.900]   Ruha, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:20.900]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:21.900]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.900]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.900]   My pleasure.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:24.900]   Okay.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.900]   Let me just hand my baby off.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:26.900]   How old is your baby?
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:33.900]   She's going to be 18 months and a day or two.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.900]   What a beautiful stage.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.900]   Yeah, she is wonderful.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.900]   We are so blessed.
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:50.900]   So today I wanted to talk to you about filing my taxes.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:55:03.020]   In 2017, we made the big exciting transition from real house to tiny house, and that move
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:11.700]   actually precipitated a whole bunch of other actions and behaviors that should be pretty
[00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:19.740]   advantageous to us for reducing our tax liability for the year.
[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.620]   And then others, of course, will actually add to our tax liability.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:32.580]   But long story short, this is my first year ever when we've had more than just a personal
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:39.220]   income from, what do you call that, a W-2, I guess?
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:46.220]   So because of all these added complexities, I'm feeling like it might be a good decision
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:51.820]   to get a professional to do our taxes this year.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:56:00.140]   But my other concern with that is, for instance, I've just been going through Jeff Schnepper's
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.980]   How to Pay Zero Taxes book.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:08.780]   And I want to hire that professional.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:16.740]   I want to hire the one who's really looking to help us save every dollar that should be
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:23.540]   ours and someone who's not just going to treat us like one more client through a revolving
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:25.900]   door.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:26.900]   You want to hire them.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.540]   I want to hire them.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.260]   Every business owner I've worked with wants to hire them.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:39.700]   And unfortunately, they're a hard person to find, and they don't come cheap.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.520]   So I think you've got to justify.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.140]   So let me ask a couple of questions, and I will be able to help guide you in the right
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.140]   direction.
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.060]   So this last year, 2017, was your first year in business.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:55.900]   So this is your first year with revenue gained from your businesses.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.900]   Is that right?
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:57.900]   Yes.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:03.940]   And about how much money in total revenue would you say that you've earned from your
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:08.740]   business activities?
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.860]   Probably around $8,000.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:19.460]   Do you have good records of your various financial transactions for the year across the board,
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:24.140]   personal expenses, business expenses, et cetera?
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:29.380]   They could be better, but they're not bad.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:32.900]   So here's been my experience.
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:43.540]   The biggest value of an accountant, a good tax planner, is in two things.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:51.820]   It's in bookkeeping for a busy business professional, and it's in proactive tax planning.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:57.980]   Those are the big, big valuable points, especially the proactive tax planning.
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:02.260]   And so if you're wading into a book like Schnepper's book, which is excellent – it's called,
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:06.480]   again, How to Pay Zero Taxes, Your Guide to Every Tax Break the IRS Allows – he issues
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.220]   a new version every year – it's excellent, but it's also overwhelming.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.260]   But if you're wading into a book like that and even looking at it, then you probably
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:18.220]   have the temperament or at least the willingness to study certain things to help you in the
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.860]   planning direction.
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:25.260]   I don't know how to find a good planning – a good tax planner in your local area.
[00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:32.980]   My personal experience has been that many accountants are competent to provide good
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:38.940]   planning, but they get very accustomed to their client base not valuing it.
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.700]   And most clients just want their returns done.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:45.960]   They just want their returns done seemingly as quickly as possible and as cheaply as possible
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.020]   so they can get their refund back.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:54.940]   And many accountants build and structure their practices in that way.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:59.860]   They build and structure their practices in a way that serves the person who brings in
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.300]   their stack of stuff and just wants it done fast and cheap.
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:10.380]   So how to find – and frankly, if I were an accountant, I would probably build a business
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:15.820]   like that because it's much harder to build and market the business related to advice
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:23.440]   and strategy than it is to market the advice related to doing the return.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:28.500]   So I don't know how to help find someone like that.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.260]   But here's how I would approach it if I were looking for somebody.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:37.580]   I would start to call different people in my local community that I had a relationship
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.780]   with, business people especially, any business person that I know from any context, someone
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:48.540]   in your church, someone in your local chamber of commerce, somebody that you are connected
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:50.940]   with and say, "I'm looking for a tax planner.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.820]   Do you know anybody in the area who I can talk to?"
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:58.500]   And you can start to get referrals in your local area to people and most accountants
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.820]   will be happy to sit and talk with you without charging you.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:07.100]   The best time to do tax planning with them is to do it not during tax season.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.260]   Here in the beginning of January is still a decent time where you can get an accountant's
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   time.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.020]   But much farther than this, this is their busy season and the best time to talk to them
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:21.020]   is in July when they're not up against the corporate deadlines or the personal deadlines
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.960]   in July or December, something like that when they have more time.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.780]   So you can potentially pursue somebody in that area.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:36.820]   With your current business revenue, I wouldn't think that it necessarily needs to be a high
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.220]   priority.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:44.760]   The tax programs, like TurboTax being I think the most well-known one or TaxCut or other
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:51.460]   competitors to those, the tax programs do a really good job of walking you through all
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:57.820]   of the potential deductions that you can take, all the potential approaches to business.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.740]   And so here's what I would recommend that you start with at the very least.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:12.580]   Print or compile as comprehensive of an inventory of your financial transactions for last year
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.360]   as you can get your hands on.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.620]   Any accounts that they have, print the statements, et cetera, the best outcome is if you have
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:26.180]   a register or a spreadsheet or something that has every financial transaction possible.
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.220]   And then start by going through something like the TurboTax software.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.500]   I've used them for years.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.020]   They do a fine job.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.380]   I'm sure the others are excellent as well.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:39.820]   But start by sitting with something like the TurboTax software and go page by page through
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:42.860]   every question that they ask you.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:48.020]   And when they ask you the question, sit and carefully read it and think, "Do I have any
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.640]   of these transactions?
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.580]   Is there anything related to this that I have?" and follow the prompts.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:02:00.500]   Most people who are basically competent in the language of business, which you clearly
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.300]   are if you've taken the action step of buying a book like Schnepper's book, most people
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:12.140]   will be perfectly able to go through TurboTax and to walk their way through it.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.780]   You can walk your way through it without buying it.
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.700]   You can use their web interface.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.900]   They don't charge you until the very end and you can start to see your results and see
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.620]   what you've got.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.940]   And I would start with that DIY process.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:31.260]   My experience has been that I've gotten big value when I was confused on certain things
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:35.420]   by consulting with a couple of accountants.
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:39.380]   But then, for example, one of my favorite accountants that worked with me and that I
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.700]   used to file my returns for a number of years then sold his practice.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.340]   And then the next guy, I didn't get much value.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.260]   And he wouldn't take the time to sit and talk to me, wouldn't take the time to do proactive
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:49.260]   planning.
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.460]   And I actually learned through the process of going to TurboTax and then starting to
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:59.660]   read more books, I learned much more to the point where I feel like there's a hard place
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.740]   for an accountant to be able to help me.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.780]   And with $8,000 of business revenue at this point, it's going to be hard for an accountant
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.720]   to make a measurable difference in your tax bill, I would guess, if you do a good job
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.940]   with TurboTax.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:19.980]   As your business grows, then I would start to solicit the advice of a professional.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.980]   Anything else or any specific questions?
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.980]   That sounds reasonable.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:28.900]   Well, my plan was to start with TurboTax and start to go through it myself and then
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:34.620]   see if I can maybe get someone to review it.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:40.340]   And I think I'm aware of a few services that will review it for free.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.300]   And then if you want advice back, they'll charge you.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   I don't know.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.500]   I'll have to look into that a little more.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:55.260]   But that pretty much covers my questions.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:04:01.300]   It just had to do with the move.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.300]   We had a few relocation expenses.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.180]   And then we started renting out our old home.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:16.260]   We're actually taking tenants on our new-- the land that we bought to develop to park
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.260]   our tiny home.
[01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:20.820]   And we actually have a tenant there as well.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:29.700]   So just with those few different categories of-- and charitable donations as well, the
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:34.820]   different categories I thought might make it worthwhile to have someone kind of on my
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:39.420]   side looking through things and saying, oh, look, you missed something there.
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   The challenge--
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.900]   But I've been using those.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.900]   Right.
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.280]   The challenge to that-- you're not wrong.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.660]   But the challenge that I've experienced practically is the quality of the advice that you'll get
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:56.220]   from a tax accountant will be dramatically impacted by the quality of your records.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.940]   In my early years in business, I didn't have very good records.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.820]   And most people don't have good records.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:07.820]   And so their accountant is essentially forced to make a good faith estimate on certain things
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:13.140]   and to do the best that they can to say, well, this is probably what happened.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.900]   But in general, if you don't have good records, it's going to be hard for them to be aggressive.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.320]   And they're certainly not going to be aggressive.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.420]   And that's, I think, what many of us would like, is we'd like to have an accountant who's
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.540]   aggressive.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.060]   But their license is at stake.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.620]   And they're not going to-- if you think about it, if you're one of 200 clients, your accountant
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:36.500]   is not going to risk their business for the benefit of you, one of 200 clients, to be
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.740]   aggressive with something that you don't have.
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.500]   And so if you don't have good records, then frequently, they can't help you all that much.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.380]   The flip side is, if you have good records, it's relatively easy for you to go ahead and
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.440]   enter those records into the program.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.860]   Most accountants don't sit down and manually fill in a Form 1040.
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.900]   They use a professional tax preparation software.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:06.140]   Usually they have a data clerk who will do the entering of the data for them.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:09.460]   And then they'll sit down and review the overall return.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.900]   And so if you're looking to save yourself a little bit of money, and you're looking
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:18.780]   to develop some skills, I don't see any reason for you not to start with a TurboTax.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:23.500]   Use TurboTax as your inspiration to dig through your records and build good records for the
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.020]   year and reconstruct anything you have.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.180]   And then if you get stuck, go ahead and at that time go and solicit advice.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:37.020]   And then take the output from TurboTax, which you learn, and go ahead and potentially consider
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:43.420]   getting a second opinion and use that referral process to try to work with a couple of accountants.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.780]   If you find a good accountant, they're well worth keeping.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:53.660]   Just like with any professional, it's sometimes harder to find a good accountant as measured
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:58.380]   not by their competence, but as measured by their willingness to work with you in the
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.740]   way that you want to be worked with.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:02.460]   And if you find them, I think you should continue to engage with them.
[01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:06.780]   But they're not easy to find.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.780]   I wish you all the best.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:12.820]   And if you have any specific questions, then feel free to connect with me or feel free
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.220]   to use the power of – there's some great tax professionals in the Radical Personal
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.340]   Finance Facebook group, really strong professionals.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.660]   Go ahead and ask your questions there, and sometimes that will point you in the right
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   direction as well.
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.620]   That is it for our Friday Q&A show.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.900]   Thank you all so much for listening.
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.220]   Man, it's good to be back to these Q&A shows.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:32.220]   I enjoy doing them.
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.540]   I invite you to join the show next week.

[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:53.620]   to do it.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.980]   If you'd like to speak with me privately, please remember that I do a limited amount
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.660]   of private phone consulting.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:03.260]   What that means is if you want to speak to me about a specific issue, it can be a private
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.060]   issue or if you want to review, if you want some feedback on advice you're hearing from
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:16.260]   another professional, feel free to go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall and you can book a call with me, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:22.140]   That call you'll pay by the minute for however much time you choose to speak with me there.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.780]   So go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall and you can find those details.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:31.220]   In general, I can't remember how many, I've got several dozen reviews there but I've not
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:39.980]   had any phone client express dissatisfaction either in a public review or dissatisfaction
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.940]   with their experience to me privately.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:48.060]   I can cut straight to the chase and oftentimes simplify complex questions and give you a
[01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   valuable bit of feedback.
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:55.660]   And if you take the cost of a phone call with me and you compare it to the potential cost
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:02.380]   of a major financial mistake, I'm very confident in the service that I offer there.
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.780]   I think that's it for today.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:13.540]   Next week we'll get back to it and I look forward to speaking with you then.
[01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:23.420]   Thank you for listening.
