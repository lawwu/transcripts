[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   I remain steadfast in my commitment to there being only one major issue facing this country,
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.860]   and that is the federal debt and the deficit.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.140]   We are increasing the federal debt by a trillion dollars every hundred days.
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.580]   That number is not slowing down.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.860]   The current budget proposal from the Biden administration calls for over $7.2 trillion
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.980]   to be spent next year.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480]   That makes the U.S. federal government roughly one-third of our country's GDP.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.840]   The outrageousness of the condition that the U.S. is in right now makes it so insane to
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.300]   me that we are talking about any other topic.
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.420]   If every voting citizen of the United States does not recognize the severity of the deficit
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.060]   and debt problem that the federal government faces, you are wasting your vote, and no candidate
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.840]   is speaking to what is clearly the biggest issue of our time, and we need to address
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   this issue headlong.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.980]   So I don't care about this person or anyone else who's running for office that is talking
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.200]   about stuff that we cannot actually address and problems we cannot actually solve if we
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.580]   don't get our fiscal affairs in order.
