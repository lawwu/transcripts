[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation," says Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:17.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's an amazing statement.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   In Christ, we participate in the new creation now.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   We are new creatures. We are regenerated.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   We have been born a second time.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   My inner man is raised from the dead by the Spirit of Christ himself.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   My sins are forgiven. I've been crucified with Christ.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives within me.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   That's Galatians 2.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   There are so many glorious pictures of the victorious Christian life.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And yet, despite all these glorious new life realities, we still sin.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We're still duped by the world, by the devil, and by our own remaining evil within.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Some of the very same false promises that captured our attention as unbelievers
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   continue to catch our eyes as believers.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   This is one of the great disappointments of the Christian life,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   to be so deeply different, and yet so easily suckered into the same sins.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   On Friday, we looked at whether our repentance is genuine if we keep confessing the same sin.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   That was APJ 1623.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Today, we address how do we reckon with our sin failures as redeemed Christians.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   This is the key theme taken up in the following clip from a 2001 sermon by John Piper.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   The clip was sent in to us from a listener named Lucy in Woking, England.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Here's Pastor John preaching on Romans chapter 7.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Two verses. Verse 17.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   That's where I get the phrase, and others get the phrase, "indwelling sin."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   See the phrase, "dwell in me"?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's like a resident.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   An ugly, seditious, warring against my soul resident.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Verse 20.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   but sin which dwells in me.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   There it is again. Two texts talk about this reality called "indwelling sin."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So his second front, the first one is to defend the law and to show that the problem is not that I have made the law to be sin.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Rather, on the second front, he's defending the reality that there is such a thing as indwelling sin rooted down deep in my life.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And I need to put it to death. I need to make war on it. But it's there and it's real.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   He's a Christian. He wants to defend the fact that he's a Christian.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I have a new nature. I have been born again. I have a taste for the things of God.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Verse 22 would be one of several verses we could look at for this point.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   "I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   "I love the law of God," he says. "I rejoice in the law, but I see a different law in my members, the members of my body."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I have been changed. I'm alive to God. I'm alive to the law. I have a spiritual taste now.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   There's a nature in me that's not just carnal.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Now that brings us to the most controversial matter that I pointed out three weeks ago and said I would come back to in order to argue the point that I made there.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And the point was this. Is Romans 7, 14 to 25 the pre-Christian Paul?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Is he describing his experience before he got saved?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Or is it the Christian Paul describing his experience in part as he experiences it now?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's the big issue. And scholars line up on both of those sides.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Godly scholars, evangelical scholars, my friends line up on those two sides.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And I told you which side I stand on and said I would be back to give you reasons. And here I am.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   The side where I stand is I believe he's talking about Christian experience.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And I want to defend that, but first let me tell you why it matters to me.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Because you might be sitting there saying, "That's about as uninteresting to me as anything I can imagine."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Here's the reason I think it should be very interesting to you and crucial to you.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   As I've watched why people don't come to Christ for their eternal joy and rather choose everlasting destruction and misery, there are several kinds of reasons.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   The one that I have in mind here is a hopelessness that settles in on the soul that doesn't say the gospel is false.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It just says there's no hope for me. That's all.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You can argue until you're blue in the face on the intellectual level with such an objection and say, "Look, you're probably right."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's a frightening thing, isn't it?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   One of the sources, not the only one, of this hopelessness is an unbiblical perfectionism
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   that does not provide people with categories to understand their own failure as a Christian.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And therefore, when they stumble and fall into a sin or some repeated sinning,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   they don't have any way to explain what's going on in their lives and they despair that they are a Christian.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And you remember three weeks ago I pointed to J.I. Packer who argued and was so thankful for the book on indwelling sin by John Owen written 350 years ago.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   He said that he was saved back in the 40s and immediately ushered into a kind of perfectionistic Christianity
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   that believed in a kind of higher life, a second experience Christianity after which you had this experience,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   you were above the struggle, walking in triumph, walking in victory, no more battles.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And he said, "I almost committed suicide, but then I read Owen and Ryle
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   who helped me understand a more balanced biblical understanding of sin in the believer's life."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Some of you asked me where you could get that book and it's in the sixth volume of the works of John Owen,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   150 pages in the middle of that book.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And I went online yesterday and found 10 stores where you can get it, all kinds of prices.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   The problem is you have to be desperate to read it because it's written in almost unintelligible 17th century English.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Sorry, the best things have to be dug for. If you rake, you get leaves. If you dig, you get diamonds.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And if you got a raking mind, you'll settle for leaves. If you got a digging mind, you get diamonds.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I commend Owen as a good mind.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Now, to further put you off, here's the title.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   "The Nature, Power, Deceit and Prevalency of the Remainders of Indwelling Sin in Believers,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Together with the Ways of its Working and Means of Prevention,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Opened, Evinced and Applied with a Resolution of Sundry Cases of Conscience Thereunto, Appertaining."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I don't expect anybody to go looking for this book, no.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But I promise you that if you read those 150 pages, you probably will not shoot yourself because of your remaining imperfection.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   You will be set on a course to know how to do battle with sin and understand your failures that saved J.I. Packer's life and I believe will save many.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So my aim this morning is to argue that this passage is about that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Namely, Christian experience in its moments of failure.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   That's what I want to argue. This text is about that and providing you with categories for understanding it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Now, one more qualification before I get into my five arguments.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Please, please, please don't misunderstand me as saying this text teaches make peace with sin.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Pastor John said, "Everybody's gonna sin and so relax, make peace with sin. It's no big deal."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That's not what I'm saying. In fact, I would say exactly the opposite.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This text is teaching make war with sin.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Make war with sin. What you read here is about a man who is on the war path against his sin.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And now he's got a spiritual nature that enables him to identify for what it really is as horrid as it is.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And he hates it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   The evidence of being a Christian is not that there are no tactical defeats in the war.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   But that you keep fighting till the promised victory is given.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   That's the evidence of being a Christian.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Powerful. Thank you, Lucy, for this clip.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   A decade after the sermon, the Banner of Truth published a Puritan paperback version of the John Owen book here mentioned.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It was abridged. It was made easier to read.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And it was given the simpler and much, much less amusing title of Indwelling Sin in Believers.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   The book is available online, Indwelling Sin in Believers by John Owen.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Lucy sent the clip. She writes, "Hi, Tony. Many thanks to you and John Piper for the EPJ podcast. I love it.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I was first introduced to John Piper's teaching when I was at a university in Edinburgh.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   By a devout Christian friend, I began listening to Piper's work and was amazed to find a seven-part series on Romans 7,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   a passage about the ongoing battle with sin, and later discovered John Piper had spent eight years expounding Romans.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I loved discovering the debate about whether Paul was talking about his pre-Christian or his Christian experience in this passage
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   because I had never heard teaching like this before."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Thank you, Lucy. This clip comes from that series, Who is This Divided Man? Part 3, preached on June 24, 2001.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And it's available along with the whole Roman series at DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Well, we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   How do we love our neighbors when they don't really need us?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Even worse, how do we love our neighbors when they mostly ignore us?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   It's a question from a disheartened listener to the podcast, and it's up next time.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We're rejoined in studio with Pastor John next time for that on Friday.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And we'll see you then.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   [END]
