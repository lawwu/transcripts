[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   (projector whirring)
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:12.960]   - Welcome back to Ask the Compound,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.560]   where we take a week off, but the questions never do.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.000]   We got a bunch more good ones today.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.120]   Today's show sponsored by our friends at Bird Dogs.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.680]   Duncan, today we're talking about diversification,
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.440]   one of my favorite topics.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.560]   I like the diversification that Bird Dogs can apply.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.480]   - I was waiting to see what you were gonna do with that.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.760]   - Yeah, I've been out on the lake a lot lately,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.800]   like riding bikes with the kids,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.640]   and these are the kind of shorts that you can take anywhere.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.160]   I wear 'em at the beach, I wear 'em to the pool,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.020]   I wear 'em on the boat.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.040]   They also have different kinds,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.240]   so I like to have diversification among my Bird Dogs.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.600]   So some of them are plain,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   some of them have nice patterns
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.760]   when I wanna feel like going crazy a little bit
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.240]   and rockin' out a little bit.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.680]   So, really like the Bird Dogs.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.480]   They're very comfy, they're very stylish.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   BirdDogs.com and BirdDogs/ATC.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.960]   BirdDogs.com/ATC, you get a free tumbler, right?
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.440]   Yeti-style tumbler, pretty cool.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.320]   - Right, yeah.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.040]   I gotta get me some of those really cool design ones.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.820]   I've just got some navy blue ones,
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.040]   and I've got some camo ones.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.040]   - Listen, I don't mind wearing a floral print here,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.760]   but I have some floral print Bird Dogs that are very nice.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.200]   People like them, I get a lot of compliments on those.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.320]   All right, let's do a question.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160]   - Nice.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.240]   Okay, so up first today we have a question from Connor.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.520]   I'm a 34-year-old with a high risk tolerance.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.080]   All of my investment accounts are 100% stocks.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.320]   The one thing I have a hard time
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.680]   finding a tried and true answer on
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560]   is how to best allocate my investments
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.800]   among large-cap, mid-cap, international,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.600]   emerging markets, et cetera.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.380]   I'm not looking to get the highest return possible, per se,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960]   although that would be nice.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.400]   Rather, I'm looking to have a well-diversified portfolio
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600]   that gives me long-term returns of 7% to 10%.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.880]   I've always utilized the following allocation,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.680]   and I'm guessing they mean annualized, obviously.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.320]   33% U.S. large-cap, 17% U.S. mid-cap,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.000]   16% U.S. small-cap, 20% developed international,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.400]   and 14% emerging markets.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.680]   Does this seem about right to you?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.960]   I'd love to know what you think about,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.600]   how you think about your stock allocation
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.840]   and what you utilize as a good benchmark.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.520]   - Well, if they want a total return of 10%,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.000]   then we'll just put them in hedge funds.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   (laughs)
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.280]   I can't promise anything when it comes to future returns,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000]   but a global benchmark for the stock market
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.160]   is actually pretty straightforward.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.280]   The world stock market is a good starting point.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.040]   So I broke down the Vanguard
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.480]   World Total Stock Market Index Fund, VT.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.160]   So John, pull up the first one.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.120]   This is just the breakdown between geographies.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.000]   So United States is roughly 60%.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.440]   International developed markets is like a third.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.480]   Emerging markets is a little less than 10%.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   So Conor here is actually pretty close to this.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.320]   Do the next one, John.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.500]   This is small, mid, large-cap
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.940]   of the same World Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.560]   large caps, a little over 70%.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.480]   Mid caps, like 20.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.920]   Small caps, again, a little less than 10.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.520]   One more, do the next one for VTI.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.300]   This is the US version of this.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.720]   It's basically the same thing as the world.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.100]   A little over 70% large, 20% small,
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.140]   or 20% mid, 8% small.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.980]   So it's pretty close.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.680]   And so if you look at Conor's portfolio here,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   it's, I mean, he's plus or minus 5% for all of these.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.480]   So actually pretty darn close.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.800]   Now, I'm not saying that,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.000]   like you have to have the global weightings
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.240]   when it comes to diversified portfolio.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.880]   I think the global market cap is a good starting point
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   just to see where you're different from the actual market.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.100]   'Cause the market is what everyone collectively holds.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.320]   So if nothing else,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.160]   you can use that as the jumping off point
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   and then use it for performance attribution
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.800]   or just to see where your bets are being made.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.320]   Like I'm going way above and beyond here, way below here.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.880]   Am I comfortable with that?
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.700]   Now, many investors,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.120]   especially US-centric investors would assume the S&P 500
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.480]   or maybe a total US stock market index fund
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.360]   would be the benchmark of choice.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   The US makes up 60% of the pie,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.360]   but probably gets 99% of the financial media coverage.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.160]   And I guess that's probably makes sense.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   So I looked the top 25 holdings
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.480]   in the Vanguard World Stock Market Index Fund.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.200]   How many do you think are foreign companies, Duncan?
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.480]   If you had to guess.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.380]   Outside the US, listed somewhere else.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.560]   - Out of how many?
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.400]   - 25.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.760]   - Four.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   - That's a pretty good, yeah, it is four.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.840]   Four total out of 25.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.940]   The first one is Taiwan Semiconductor at like 13.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.600]   So the top 10 holdings in the World Global Stock Market Fund
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.180]   are the same as the S&P 500, basically.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.520]   So America just dominates the stock market.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.800]   I do, however, think there's still room for diversification
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.160]   if you're gonna invest your entire portfolio in stocks.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.720]   I know it seems like the S&P 500
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.840]   always outperforms everything,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.400]   but you really don't have to go back that far
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.960]   to find a time when the S&P 500
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.160]   got just shellacked and underperformed.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.180]   So John, let's do a chart on.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.240]   This is the total returns
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480]   for the first decade of this century.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.000]   This is large cap, mid cap, small cap US,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   and then international developed and emerging markets.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.720]   And this is 2000 to 2009.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320]   Total return for the S&P 500 was down 9%.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.080]   You lost a little bit more than 1% per year
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.640]   and you had 250% corrections to show for it.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.220]   Mid caps and small caps were both up almost 90%.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.200]   International developed outperformed the US
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.640]   by a healthy margin.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.000]   And then emerging markets just knocked it out of the park.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.600]   And this was a horrible time to be a US investor.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.340]   It was a great time to diversify.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.440]   Now, if we look at the next decade, 2010 to 2019,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.160]   obviously the S&P 500 came back.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.480]   Emerging markets went from first to worst.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.360]   Mid cap and small cap actually did pretty well again.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   International developed lagged again.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.600]   But it's kind of interesting.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.440]   So if you put it all together
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.540]   and do these first two decades in this last chart, John,
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.440]   the S&P 500 from 2000 to 2019
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.400]   was actually fourth place out of these five asset classes.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.360]   Small and mid caps did the best.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.520]   Emerging markets actually outperformed from 2000 to 2019,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.160]   which might surprise some people.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.040]   Now, some of this has to do with the start and end dates.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.080]   My favorite saying here is that
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.320]   if you want to win any argument about performance
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.300]   in the markets, just change your start and end dates.
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.080]   You can take this one off, John.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.440]   So I could change the start and end date
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   and show that the S&P did better in these different periods.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440]   But maybe that's my point,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.320]   is that you just never know when certain asset classes
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.080]   or markets or geographies or market caps
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.680]   are going to outperform
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.160]   or when they're gonna knock the cover off the ball
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.000]   or a shirk out or whatever.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.400]   So that's why I think diversification is important,
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.920]   even if you're gonna be all in the stocks.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   I think, you know, could you, I mean,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.920]   if you get to the point where you're thinking,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.280]   should I do 2% more here or 3% less here?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.560]   I think you've probably already won the game
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.540]   in terms of asset allocation.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.780]   As long as you can stick with it, you're fine.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.560]   But it seems like this, Conor, is on the right track here.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.680]   - Yeah, yeah, it sounds like it.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.980]   With EM, that last chart,
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.720]   you would think that if you're taking that much risk,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.480]   you would expect a little more outperformance
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.720]   over the S&P.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.860]   - Well, it's just gotten crushed these past 12,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.040]   pretty much since 2008, it has been the S&P.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.520]   But I used the S&P 600 and 400 here
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.760]   for the small and mid caps.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.920]   And they've done better than most people would have assumed.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   So yeah, the diversification,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.400]   it seems like it hasn't worked,
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.140]   but if you zoom out a little bit, which I like to do,
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.680]   it's done pretty darn good.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.440]   All right, next question.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.120]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Amy.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   Like Ben, I'm one of the oldest millennials,
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.520]   just turned 40 this year.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.640]   - Backhanded compliment of the day.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.120]   - Yeah, my husband and I make good money, six figures.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.840]   I'm a lawyer and he's in finance.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.140]   But I also have $100,000 in student loans from law school.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.080]   We have a high income,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.440]   but not enough financial assets just yet.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.000]   So I don't think we qualify for a financial advisor.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.700]   But I have a lot of financial questions
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.360]   as we transition into middle age.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.240]   Sorry, Michael.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.360]   How do we, they're really in the, yeah.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.640]   I mean, they know our shows.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.800]   So good job, Amy.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.360]   Thanks for watching.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   How do we know if we're on the right track
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.720]   with retirement savings is question one.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.960]   Second question, how much do we set aside
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.840]   for our two kids 529 plans?
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.520]   Third question, should I pay off my student loans
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.640]   or keep investing in my 401k plan?
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's a popular question as of late.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.560]   And they say, I feel like we're doing well
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.400]   for people our age,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.180]   but I have no idea how to gauge our progress.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.440]   Any thoughts?
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.360]   - All right, so this is the middle age question
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.480]   where you go from, okay, we've started saving,
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.320]   we're getting our life together.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.040]   Now we have financial planning questions.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.280]   So let's bring in a financial advisor
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.680]   who focuses on millennials.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.760]   Doug Bonaparte from Bonafide Wealth.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.920]   - Hey, Doug.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.840]   - Hey, guys.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.240]   - One of the best advisors in the country.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.820]   - That's what they say.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.120]   - That's the rankings, you can't argue with those.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.320]   Doug, you focus explicitly on millennials
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.260]   and you've been going through this transition
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.160]   with them as well, where when you're just starting off,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.360]   it's setting up the right accounts and getting saving.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.600]   And some people are overwhelmed with that,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.800]   but that seems like the easy part.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.760]   The hard part is when you get
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.440]   to these financial planning questions.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.000]   And I do think it's kind of a misnomer
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.280]   that people think, well, I don't have a million dollars
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.880]   or $2 million or $5 million.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.280]   So a financial advisor is not for me.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.800]   And maybe in the old days, that was the case
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.960]   where you had to have a certain minimum,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.760]   but there are many different business models these days
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.580]   and many people that can work with someone
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.560]   who has a high income and is going to have assets one day
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.200]   and has questions, but you can still find an advisor.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.960]   So you've dealt with these kinds of clients.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.520]   So I'm curious to hear your thoughts
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   on dealing with a situation like this.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.120]   - Yeah, man, you nailed it.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.280]   There are so many, not just myself,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.160]   but so many amazing colleagues that work with
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.600]   not just older millennials here,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   I like to call it us geriatric millennials,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.800]   but you have advisors catering to Gen Z.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.280]   I mean, you have babies offering...
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.120]   Fine, no, just kidding.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.820]   You don't have infantile financial advisors yet.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.120]   But you reach this point where it's kind of a good problem
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.960]   to have, right?
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   You've reached a certain amount of success
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.880]   and you're like, "Look, my free time."
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.160]   I always describe the best time to figure out
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.840]   whether you need a financial advisor
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   is when your free time has gone down so much
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   because your responsibilities have gone up so much.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.520]   You have a couple of kids, you're balancing your career,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.680]   you're knocking 40, you're entering peak earning year.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.360]   So you're super, super busy,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.000]   stretched thin in almost every part of your life.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.440]   And it does suck to think that
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.960]   you don't have access to a qualified professional
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   simply because you don't have enough money
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.240]   for them to manage.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.800]   Let's throw that out the window right now.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.160]   As I just said, there are lots of qualified professionals
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   to help you here.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.340]   - So I think your point that you make is good
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.760]   about being stretched.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.700]   We both have young kids.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.160]   We know how life can get busy,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.140]   but it's outsourcing the decisions
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.600]   and also outsourcing the worries in some ways.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.240]   Because a lot of these questions that they ask in here,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.480]   they're not really black or white.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.160]   They're kind of exist in a shade of gray.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.760]   And so I think some people at a certain point
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.600]   just want someone to help them.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.040]   Like help me make a decision and come up with a plan.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   Even if I know that there's probably
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.240]   three or four good answers here.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   And there's not one answer that's gonna be perfect,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.800]   but help someone understand my situation
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.240]   and then help me execute this actual plan.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.440]   - 100%.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.920]   A great financial advisor or planner
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.160]   is going to help you make
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.040]   the best financial decision possible for you.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.480]   Where sometimes there's only one way to do it, right?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.280]   You gotta go get your will,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.000]   you gotta do your basic estate planning documents.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Like go get it done.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.640]   Versus, hey, let's talk about what your investment style is.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   And in this particular question,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.600]   they're asking about goal priority.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.920]   And that is where should I put the first
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.840]   and last dollar of available savings?
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400]   I have multiple goals, right?
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.080]   It could be saving for a home, retirement,
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.520]   the kids going to college,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.560]   and other stuff we haven't even brought
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.160]   into the equation here.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   And that's where things start to get a little bit complex
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.880]   and only emphasizes the need
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.680]   to actually go through formal financial planning.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.360]   That is the system that helps you figure out
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   how to allocate your free cash.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.280]   You have to also have some sense of ownership
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.040]   over what's most important to you.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.760]   It's not my financial life I'm solving for.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.880]   It's the client's.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.200]   If they had told me,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.240]   making sure that we achieve what we,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.840]   the parents here or the husband and wife
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.800]   or whatever the structure is,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.680]   that we achieve financial independence
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.880]   above sending our kids to college,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.000]   the advisor's gotta show them how to go about doing that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.280]   Answering that question's critical
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.240]   towards the allocation of that money.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.040]   So financial planning is hands down the tool
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   that's gonna bring you through retirement planning,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.200]   college education planning.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.280]   The last one about student loans versus 401k,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   I think actually is a little bit more technical
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.200]   of how to go about allocating than really goal priority,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.040]   although you still need to understand
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.600]   which is most important to you.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.640]   But I think about that question probably like you do, Ben,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.480]   what do we expect in terms of a consistent
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.320]   or long-term rate of return
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.640]   on investing in a 401k or any other type of account
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.320]   versus what's the interest rate on that loan, on that debt?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.240]   And are we gonna be better off
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.360]   paying down an eight, nine, 10% loan?
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.760]   Well, can we get eight, nine, 10% consistently
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.600]   in the market?
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.940]   At eight, yeah, we're in an interest rate environment now
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.400]   where it's not so clear cut or becoming more clear
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.240]   that paying down expensive debt is the way to go, right?
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.040]   - Yeah, it was easier when rates were a little lower,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.760]   that question, I agree.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.700]   I love your idea on goal priority
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.400]   because that is one of the biggest jobs
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.480]   of financial advisors, that it's kind of,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.040]   you can't really define it very well,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.200]   it's not quantifiable, but that this goal priority thinking
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.720]   in terms of like what actually matters to you.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.940]   And those are the hardest questions
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.480]   for some people to answer sometimes.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.920]   And then, yeah, you're right,
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.160]   it's figuring out a plan to hit those.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   David in the chat, I just want you to know,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   said the rule number one for picking a financial advisor
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.560]   is finding someone with a great shirt.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   And before we got on here, Doug informed us
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   that these are called camper shirts, which I didn't know.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.120]   So now you learned something.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.080]   I thought I was the GQ expert here,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.480]   but Doug is schooling us on fashion.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.200]   - We are rocking camper T-shirts apparently, yeah.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.920]   - You're the real fashion expert, but yeah, I guess maybe.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.200]   - You'll receive my consulting invoice in the mail shortly.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.360]   - Yeah, all right, let's do another question.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.400]   - Okay, up next we have a question from Adam.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.920]   How do you factor in RSUs for budgeting?
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.960]   And RSU stands for restricted stock unit.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.920]   - You're getting them Duncan.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.220]   - Yeah, we don't count them all in our budget
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.720]   and it works much tighter than reality.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.560]   Should we?
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.080]   Either way, what is a good budget scheme
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.440]   for someone in a very high income bracket?
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.160]   A 50, 30, 20 needs, wants savings isn't working for us,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   particularly on things that are automated or fixed,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.520]   like mortgages.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.200]   What's a reasonable clothing budget or vacation budget?
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.080]   That's what makes this too difficult.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.520]   - So this is interesting because, so they're in there,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.760]   on paper, they're probably more wealthy
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.840]   than they feel in the income that they're receiving.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.480]   'Cause they know that those stock units
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.720]   are coming at some point.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   And so they're probably living a little bit
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.800]   above their current level of income,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.120]   but they're looking at their level of wealth
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.000]   and what it could be someday and thinking,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.840]   well, I should be up here because I have these stock units.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   And unfortunately, in the past couple of years,
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.960]   some people have probably had that knocked down a peg or two
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.360]   if they've been in a tech company
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.040]   and they've seen the stock options
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.360]   not worth nearly as much as they thought they would be.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.480]   They probably were counting that money
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.840]   before it even showed up.
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.760]   But how do you think about this?
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.280]   You think it's coming someday
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.860]   and you maybe have a timeframe or you don't.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.200]   It's kind of like an inheritance maybe.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.920]   Like I know I'm gonna get some money someday.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.400]   And so should I just spend more now
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   with the understanding that this money's coming,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.080]   but you don't know, this is a tricky one.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.280]   So how do you plan for something like this?
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.520]   - Ideally, the most like clean way to do it
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.800]   is I'd like to think of RSUs
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.000]   and equity or incentive compensation
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.480]   as icing on the cake, a windfall,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.780]   as you suggested with an inheritance.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.680]   Now, some asterisks or caveats to that,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.180]   depending on what company we're talking about,
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.280]   the vesting schedule really having a lot to do with it.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.840]   I'll pick on Amazon for an example.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.560]   It's a really great example for what you're mentioning
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.040]   with not only the stock being worth less than it was
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.320]   just a couple of years ago,
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.160]   but the way they engineer the vesting schedule
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.120]   and the way they go about doing the grant.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.760]   So when you receive RSUs in this case,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.720]   has a lot to do with how you're going to view that.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.640]   And a lot to do with your overall compensation package.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.360]   I'll give you a quick example.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.040]   If your base salary can't cover,
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.440]   your monthly not,
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   you're going to be looking at those RSUs
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.880]   as the way to cover that.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.040]   And if you're vesting every month,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.380]   you're going to be very tempted to view that
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.800]   as truly income, that's supplementing your base salary.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.240]   Flip it around.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.360]   If your base salary or your household stable income
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.200]   through salaries is enough to cover the monthly not,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.320]   you can more easily view stock incentives
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.440]   as icing on the cake, as long-term investment assets,
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.320]   whether you sell it and diversify it or keep it
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.600]   because you're long on your company is a separate question.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.480]   So a lot of companies, look,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.840]   they go into this knowing this, right?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.240]   And for the company,
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.120]   it's really about what kind of incentive
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.840]   are they trying to create?
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.640]   And what really handcuffs
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.920]   are they trying to put around your wrists?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.520]   It's a little bit, I don't know if insidious
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.360]   is the right word,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.040]   but it's a little bit more gaming you, the employee,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.360]   when they're pushing you more towards,
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.200]   you got to eat these RSUs versus,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.440]   hey, this is an award for doing a great job
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.040]   and we just want you to stick around.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.800]   - To your point, you really have to understand
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.880]   how these work and every one maybe works a little different
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   depending on the company and the timing
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.260]   and then the tax treatment of them and all these things.
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.740]   Another potential financial advisor savior here,
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.360]   but you better know what you're doing with these
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.480]   before you start counting the money
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.240]   and planning on it just being there.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.840]   I'm sure there were a lot of people in Silicon Valley
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.680]   the last couple of years
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.120]   who were ready to buy a huge house or something
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.880]   because they know these stock options are coming
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.920]   and then they fall 80% or whatever it is
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   and then now what do you do?
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.440]   - Exactly.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.080]   Our good friend Morgan Housel wrote a piece the other week
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.240]   called "Expectation Debt" specifically around this topic
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.360]   where you see the price of that stock
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.380]   in the form of RSUs or performance based options go up,
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.040]   you're wealthy on paper,
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.720]   but you now got to repay that debt, there's a debt there.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.280]   And that's the reversion to the mean,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.620]   the fact that you need to plan for the fact
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.840]   that you are not going to be as wealthy
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.280]   as you are at that moment.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.960]   And if you build your life around that,
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.760]   you buy a house that's large
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.920]   and now commands that you pay a larger mortgage
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.160]   than you thought 'cause you felt rich at the moment,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.440]   these are classic personal finance traps.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.600]   And it's not helpful
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.800]   and I'm not trying to vilify companies that do this,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.400]   that's how they chose to incentivize
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.280]   and motivate their employees.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.360]   More times than not,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.840]   your employer is not looking out
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.760]   for your financial wellbeing.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.380]   It's great if they are, so don't be naive.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.540]   You have to take that into your own hands.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.860]   And if you fell into that trap,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.080]   you're gonna pay for that if the stock goes down.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.400]   And they don't always say,
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.960]   hey, the price of the stock went down,
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.640]   let's make sure you get more of those shares granted to you
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.520]   at the refresher.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.400]   They're like, no, things are pretty crappy here,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.280]   you're getting less.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.160]   So you then find yourself in a bind.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.540]   So I would recommend to anyone,
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.640]   back to financial planning concepts,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   how are you viewing cashflow
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.140]   from the forms of compensation you receive?
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.800]   It's not necessarily a bad thing
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   that you're eating performance-based
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.860]   or restricted stock to live,
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.440]   but you need to have a really good context around that
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.400]   in the short, intermediate, and long term
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.320]   so you don't fall into one of those holes later on.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.480]   - Right, and yeah, maybe treat it more like a bonus
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.820]   than part of the actual budget,
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.920]   depending on when you're gonna get it.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.360]   - Ideally, that would be the case.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   But again, if you need X a month
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.120]   and you're not gonna get that
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.140]   from your base salary,
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.400]   because that's just not how your comp structure is,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.660]   your kind of hand is forced
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.700]   to either do uncomfortable austerity,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.100]   either lower the cost of your lifestyle,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.740]   and that's gonna be very hard for a lot of people
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.580]   who've grown accustomed to something,
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.300]   or I now need to dive in.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   Yes, in a perfect world,
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.180]   we'd love not to touch this other form of stock,
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.180]   treat it as a bonus,
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.020]   but it doesn't always break like that.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.380]   Careful planning will get you there.
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.140]   - That's why I require part of my salary
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.540]   to be paid in physical oat milk delivery.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.380]   So that's all.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.480]   - I thought we were just paying you
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.600]   in hats every week, Duncan.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.440]   - Yeah, true.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.020]   Speaking of which, more on that.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.860]   Remind me.
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.160]   - All right, next question.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.200]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from James.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.700]   I'm struggling with financial planning
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.040]   in a dual income house.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.600]   It seems like the typical advice
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.000]   in terms of savings rate and income needed at retirement
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.120]   should differ between single and dual income households.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.860]   I live in a high cost of living area,
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.720]   have two kids in Catholic school,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.420]   and we both work.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.360]   Dual income means we spend a lot more
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.640]   on children, camps, et cetera.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.000]   Our income is pretty high,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.320]   so having X percent saved of our income by age 40 is tough.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.800]   It just doesn't seem like the commonly provided targets
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.760]   really match up.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.960]   Any thoughts on this?
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.880]   - So a dual income household
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.400]   is actually in a much better position.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   A dual income household with kids,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.000]   that's tougher, right?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.160]   So we're talking single versus dual income,
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.000]   that's different.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.440]   I think this is just more like managing a family,
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.640]   even when you have a dual income,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.800]   can be difficult for people,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.080]   especially depending on where you live.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.200]   And I'm sure these people have seen these charts
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.800]   from a financial place that shows
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   by 35 you should have this much saved,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.200]   by 40 you should have this much saved,
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.260]   by 45, and people look at those numbers
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.800]   and they say I'm not even close to that,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.200]   or you should have this X amount,
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.500]   X times your salary saved, or whatever it is,
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.480]   because they've run these numbers through the spreadsheet,
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.280]   and people look at these and they go this is crazy,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.200]   I'm never gonna get there, I'm way behind already,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.960]   I'm stuck, what do I do?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.360]   And I think this is a tough place for people to be
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   when they're trying to measure against these goalposts
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.680]   that are unrealistic to them.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.120]   - Well, it seems like everyone used to say
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.480]   just have a million dollars to retire, you know?
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.120]   Like I remember just hearing that all the time,
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.280]   people talking about a million, a million, a million.
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.640]   It's kind of funny that's changed.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   - Obviously a lot of it depends on how much
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.960]   you're actually spending and what your lifestyle is,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.040]   but I think for some people they have to figure out,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.400]   I mean, Doug, as parents,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.800]   you want to give your kids the world
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.940]   and you never want to hold back on experiences with them
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.560]   or letting them do what they want to do,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.040]   so I think maybe for some people they have to figure out
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.400]   like, can I supercharge savings later in life
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.080]   if I'm slowing down right now
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.000]   or having some sort of fallback plan in the future
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.040]   to juice things when they need to.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.120]   - Awesome lead for me on that one.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.880]   Yeah, it's a little, that's correct,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.440]   but let's get into the nuance of that.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.480]   You know, this question is posed by what I would argue
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.220]   are, you know, highly performing or, you know,
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.680]   two professionals that are striving to, you know,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.560]   continue to grow in their careers,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.000]   and when you think about career growth,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.660]   and by the way, career growth and expanding the top line
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.080]   is just one of those conversations in personal finance
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.700]   that doesn't get talked about enough,
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.860]   because you talk about those rules of thumbs,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.480]   you start to treat this as a linear system, right?
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.300]   Nothing, nothing in personal finance,
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.240]   the markets, the economy is linear.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.640]   It just doesn't work like that,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.400]   and that's when things start to become oversimplified.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   So to your point, it is tough.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.440]   It is very tough in planning to say,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.880]   "Okay, we're doing great, we're making all this money."
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.400]   You know, you can't go back on certain,
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.240]   you send your kids to camp, you're then next year,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.160]   and they love it, you're not not sending them
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.500]   to camp the next year, like you're locked into that.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.200]   Like, there's just things you can't walk back
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.800]   in this type of environment.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.980]   - I just got sent pictures from my wife today.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.960]   The kids are at some outdoor camp,
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.640]   and they're both riding a horse, ear to ear smile,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.560]   and there's no way they're,
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.920]   they're gonna have to go there every year now.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.600]   - Yeah, there you go, and you're committed
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.480]   to X thousands of dollars every year
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.880]   for the next eight years.
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.560]   And we just took our daughter to, you know,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   a rookie day at a camp, just like, "Great."
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.600]   You know, and oh, this is gonna be the greatest gift
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.440]   that we could give her.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.160]   Truly, it is a magnificent, life-defining gift
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.560]   that equates to an economic function of our household.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.820]   And this type of stuff is what is in this question.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.480]   So let's talk about the thing that's not said is,
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.800]   how are they thinking about the trajectory of their careers?
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.720]   I would hope that most people hustling in careers
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.440]   that first provide for upward mobility and income
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.280]   are doing that.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.560]   And that could be a dangerous or tricky game to play,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.440]   saying like, look, I'm gonna give them this now,
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   or I'm going to choose.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.380]   This is the active choice to remain this comfortable,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.800]   and it comes at this cost,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.540]   but I'm gonna bet on myself and my career
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.380]   in order to get there.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.840]   And the thing you gotta be mindful of,
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.580]   the lifestyle creep, right?
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.320]   That when you do elevate your income,
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   and you now are back in the position
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.280]   of being able to super save,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.180]   how quickly will that go away
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.680]   based on the decisions that you are going to make?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.640]   And then factor in that life's fickle, not linear.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.000]   You could lose a job, there's great,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.080]   or you could find yourself moving across the country
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.640]   for a great opportunity and making even more money.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.680]   People don't just sit in one spot.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   I, in my own career, have gone from cool,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.840]   look, we're maxing out 401ks and savings and all this stuff.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.780]   The 529 plans, well, the firm's got to grow again.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.460]   We have to make investment in the business.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.840]   And this is coming from the entrepreneurial side,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.900]   not just the, well, I want to send my kids to campsite,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.100]   or we really do need this vacation
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.240]   because if we don't take it,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.260]   we are gonna burn out and become unproductive at our jobs,
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.500]   and that's a risk we're not willing.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.380]   Whoever thought taking a nice vacation
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.060]   would actually equate to ensuring
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.060]   that you're able to consider,
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.020]   or continue growing your income.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.140]   They're not-- - The other thing is,
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.380]   you're probably gonna have to,
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.520]   there's always trade-offs with this,
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.920]   and if your kids are going to be,
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.760]   and family is going to be your number one priority,
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.660]   or one of them, then somewhere else
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.440]   is gonna have to be cut back, right?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.320]   It's gonna have to be fancy restaurants,
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.840]   or your trips aren't gonna have to be as nice,
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.720]   or something, so unfortunately, something has to give.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.240]   If you're living in a high-cost of living area,
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.240]   maybe you don't have as much transportation,
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.220]   you don't have cars, or some way,
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.640]   you have to give up something, unfortunately.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.880]   I think that's part of it is prioritizing
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.040]   and giving up on something,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.360]   and that's your point of lifestyle creep.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.260]   If you wanna have it all, and you look around,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.540]   and you say, "I'm getting nowhere,"
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.260]   then something has to give there.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:58.300]   - Absolutely, for folks that can't increase their top line,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.660]   this is extraordinarily relevant.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.900]   You definitely then need to focus on the bottom line.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.380]   Not everyone has even the ability to go out.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.300]   It's so cliche, at this point,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.820]   to be like, "Go get a side hustle."
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.580]   It's like, "Yo, I'm working 70 hours a week.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.820]   "This is what I'm gonna make."
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.500]   There's no opportunity for that.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.780]   So Ben, to your point, yeah,
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.180]   maybe you didn't need that extra roll
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:18.340]   when you went out with Innards.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.180]   Does that add up?
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.640]   Do the smaller things add up?
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.100]   Yeah, everything adds up,
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.580]   but when you don't have that ability
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.460]   to increase your top line,
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.680]   you have to get super critical about the expenses
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.520]   and all of those.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.020]   - But I agree with you that the personal finance blind spot
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.580]   has always been making more money,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.420]   and for a lot of people, that's the key.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.420]   You just have to figure out a way
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.340]   to then continue saving a percentage of it
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.580]   and not just spending the whole thing.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.060]   If and when you do get to the point,
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.100]   you do make more money.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.220]   - I like doing a ratio here.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.480]   I tell my clients, "Hey, cool, you got that bonus
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.800]   "or you got that raise.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.740]   "I'm okay with you increasing lifestyle.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:54.140]   "Just make it one to five of lifestyle to savings
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.060]   "or one to 10 or whatever it is."
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.420]   If you keep up that kind of mentality,
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.260]   you're gonna save more
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.820]   and you're gonna enjoy life a little bit more too
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.860]   when you spend every dollar
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.100]   that you made more on a vacation.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.860]   Yeah, you're definitely not getting anywhere.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.700]   - Right, all right, we got one more question.
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.700]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Zach.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.040]   "I work in investment banking
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.000]   "and have a comfortable comp package
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.280]   "given my current lifestyle.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.420]   "However, I struggle with what I should do
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.460]   "as it relates to my savings, excluding 401k.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.100]   "I'm looking to purchase my first home
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.220]   "within the next two years,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.760]   "but I'm looking for guidance on the split
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.240]   "between a high yield savings account
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.700]   "and my brokerage account.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.340]   "I currently have about $30,000 in the savings account
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.920]   "and the same in brokerage.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.080]   "Should I just take 20% from each paycheck
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.700]   "and put it directly into the brokerage
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.820]   "since I have a cushion in the savings account
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.020]   "or continue to split between the savings and brokerage?"
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.460]   - So this is like a bucketing thing
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.420]   where if you think about it,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.020]   all your money is in one bucket.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.340]   You have all this money,
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.320]   but you have different strategies
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.220]   depending on the time horizon for it.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.160]   So obviously, this person's saying,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.020]   "I know the 401k, I can't touch that for decades,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.120]   "or I won't, but I have this other money
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.900]   "where I have a goal that's coming up
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.940]   "in a fairly short period of time
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.100]   "and I wanna buy a house.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.700]   "How do I allocate my cash savings?"
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.940]   I think this one's probably easier
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:08.820]   than it was a few years ago
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.080]   because we actually finally have some short-term yield.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:11.920]   You can put it in.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.600]   This is one of the questions we got more than any other
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.780]   from people for years is like,
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.280]   "I'm saving for a house or I'm saving for a wedding.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.160]   "Where do I put it 'cause interest rates are zero?"
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.140]   Now that they're not zero anymore, it's a little easier.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.220]   And so I don't know if they're asking
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.060]   if they should have some money in the stock market
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.900]   because they're gonna be spending it two years.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.140]   - Yeah, that's what I used to.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.440]   - But I think with a goal that short-term,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.980]   the stock market is always very risky in the short-term,
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.460]   and especially for something as important as a house,
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.880]   risking it in the stock market,
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.940]   I think is almost just too big of a risk.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.420]   I don't know what your rule of thumb is
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.260]   for something like this,
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.100]   if it's two years, three years, five years,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:46.940]   something like that.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.420]   But I think you have to have some sort of rule of thumb
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.220]   where you say the stock market in a short period of time,
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.580]   even though it goes up most of the time,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.780]   is too risky for a goal that's this important.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.060]   - Yeah, it'd be quite the hot take
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.620]   to go against that wisdom right there.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.300]   And I would argue even, not only do I agree,
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.700]   but I would go back to the comment
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.300]   about when interest rates were low and you got nothing.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.220]   I would still favor that.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.220]   - The safety of it, right?
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.020]   - Yeah, the bottom line is there is no reward
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.780]   attractive enough in that short period of time
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.620]   to justify the risk that you would need to take
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.820]   in order, when it comes to needing that money.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.540]   So whether interest rates were at 1%
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.860]   or you could get 5% in your money market fund,
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.160]   the goal is cash here.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.660]   In some cases, you really do need to know yourself
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.580]   and your own risk tolerance.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.640]   So let's use like real terms on that.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.800]   Okay, you're saving for a home
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.880]   and you make an extra five grand
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.840]   because you decided to invest a good portion of that.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.000]   You're gonna do what Warren Buffett says,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.960]   put it in the S&P 500, bet on America.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.200]   You got an extra five grand to your name here.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.060]   That's not going to do much
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.280]   other than maybe defray closing costs
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.280]   or a nice sofa in the house.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.680]   Yeah, fantastic.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.200]   But what if you lost five or 10?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.960]   You're gonna kick yourself, right?
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.200]   What if that's the difference of you closing or not?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.040]   Well, first of all,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.860]   if that's the difference of you closing,
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.400]   you probably did poor planning from the jump.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   - To your point, if you gaining the closing costs,
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.240]   that's great.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.440]   But if you lose the closing costs,
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.880]   that's gonna hurt way more.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.120]   The downside is way bigger than the upside,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.660]   even for the same amount of money.
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.500]   - Exactly.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.960]   It's disproportionate, the downside
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.080]   than it is to the upside.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.480]   So my rule of thumb is zero to four years,
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.600]   you can go with cash risk-free.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.960]   I think it's great that for the first time since 2007,
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.560]   you and I remember when you could get some yield
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.880]   on some stuff.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.760]   Folks younger than us,
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.300]   this is their first rodeo
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.920]   and actually being outside
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.480]   of a zero interest rate environment.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.360]   So it looks cool.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.440]   And there's a whole lot of stuff
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.400]   we could talk about on that.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.960]   But yeah, it's cash.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.520]   Forgo the brokerage.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.520]   We could talk about a small allocation to fixed income
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.280]   and whether there's an opportunity there.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.840]   But the bottom line is they could lose value too.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.680]   - Right.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.000]   So if you really wanna go crazy and speculate,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.640]   take like 5% of the money maybe
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   and an amount you're willing to lose and not be there,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.920]   something like that if you really want to.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.360]   Otherwise, I don't know why you'd take the risk,
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.400]   especially if it means not buying a house.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.960]   Especially since it's so difficult
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.800]   to buy a house these days,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.000]   you want your finances as shored up as possible
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.480]   'cause there's just not a lot of houses out there.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.720]   - Yeah, you gotta be pretty aggressive on the savings
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.280]   and just getting the money in that bucket
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.360]   for the home personal.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.760]   It is extraordinarily difficult
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.280]   depending on what market we're talking about.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.360]   It's just not a fun thing to do.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.600]   So take the safety of it.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.440]   And life is a little bit more simple
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.520]   when you look short-term.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.960]   It's cash, it's risk-free.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.520]   And when you're thinking retirement long-term, go risk on.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.040]   I mean, you have time on your side
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.560]   versus time not on your side.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.280]   And it's as clear cut as that.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.120]   One of the few things we can just be like,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.360]   it is what it is.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.200]   - Right.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.040]   Okay, Doug, we're gonna plug here.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.840]   Newsletter, "This is the Top," right?
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.680]   It's a sub stack.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.200]   - Yeah, yeah, I get to plug something here.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.600]   Cool, I write a sub stack called thisisthetop.substack.com.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.160]   You can get to that following me on any social media.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.080]   We gotta pump threads, right?
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.840]   That's what everyone's trying to get followers on now.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.680]   But it says @DougBonaparte on all your favorite-
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.080]   - Can you believe we have to completely start over
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.840]   on social media again?
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.760]   - Not if you're like a massive influencer and celebrity
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.600]   that gave you that.
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.320]   I felt like Meta should have given them a delayed start
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.160]   and we get the head start.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.760]   That would have been more fair,
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.160]   but that's not apparently how ad dollars work here.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.200]   Yeah, we gotta start all over here.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.040]   Yay.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.480]   - I'm not loving threads, I gotta be honest.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.800]   Everyone, I know it's uncool to say you don't like threads,
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.960]   but I'm not getting into it so far.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.400]   Maybe I'm just too used to threads.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.760]   - Yeah, I have no choice.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.160]   My general counsel and head of business development,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.440]   AKA my wife, is, "Get on there, go do it."
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.800]   It is another avenue.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.480]   You take the Gary V approach of it's not Twitter or threads.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.800]   It's Twitter and threads.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.840]   It's like, "Great, I have this other-"
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.160]   - Diversification, Duncan.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.000]   - Yeah. - Back to that.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.320]   - It's true, diversify your social media.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.640]   - The compound is on threads.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.040]   - Isn't that the threat though?
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.080]   But isn't that the threat?
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.360]   You know, like, "Oh, your platform's going away,
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.480]   "so you need to get it."
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.160]   I don't think any of them, you know,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.880]   with serious dollars behind them from a company like Meta
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.480]   or Elon is going anywhere.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.320]   This is too much money going towards them.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.520]   - I did sign up for a post account in Mastodon, I think,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.240]   and at Josh's recommendation,
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.960]   like you were talking about on Animal Spirits,
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.800]   then I haven't used it.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.960]   - See, that's too much diversification.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.960]   All right, if you wanna send us a question,
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.400]   email us askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.760]   Thanks again to Doug for joining.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.640]   We appreciate it.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.040]   All the young people, millennials, asking our questions.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.360]   If you're listening to a podcast, leave us a review.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.720]   You're on YouTube, leave us a comment or a question.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.880]   New hat, Duncan?
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   - New hat, dropping in the shop,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.360]   idontshop.com tomorrow at noon, this hat.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.480]   I was supposed to be wearing it on the show.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.320]   I forgot. - That's great.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   - Okay, so thanks again to Bird Dogs,
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.160]   and we will see you next time.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   - See you, everyone.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.480]   you
