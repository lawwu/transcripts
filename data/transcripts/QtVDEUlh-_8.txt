[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   We close out the week with a question from Aaron,
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.800]   a podcast listener in Sherburn, New York.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.960]   Pastor John, I just listened to the APJ episode number 634.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.400]   Is my Bible reading too academic?
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.020]   It is wonderfully instructive.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.280]   I'm the academic type.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.400]   I'm no genius, but I enjoy the exercise of thinking.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   It's almost athletic to me.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.360]   It's food.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.980]   But here's my question.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.960]   When I'm being academic to the glory of God,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.180]   discovering his word rigorously, systematically,
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.480]   in detail, in a regular, disciplined manner,
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.580]   and that study is raising my affections for God,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.540]   and when I rejoice in God when I'm done,
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.200]   when I wanna bow down or lift up my voice into him
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.740]   as a result, when I'm more in love with him,
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.060]   if all of that is true, how do I help the people
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.660]   for whom thinking is a turnoff,
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780]   that for whom dividing things so closely
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.840]   leaves them feeling cold, as you say?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.700]   What would you say to Erin as she tries to help her friends?
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700]   - The first thing I would say is that you should make clear
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.720]   to those folks, the so-called non-thinkers
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.660]   that we're gonna talk about, that you believe,
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.080]   you know, that many non-thinkers
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.360]   may be far better lovers of people than many thinkers are.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   Make sure they know that you don't think thinking
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.360]   is the one criterion by which a person's worth
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   or effectiveness or virtue is determined.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.600]   So they need to get that.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   Then I think the challenge is to find ways
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   of motivating them to think as clearly,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.880]   logically, and biblically as they can.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   And my assumption here is that all things being equal,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.600]   a person who thinks clearly and logically and biblically
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.960]   will be more fruitful and more effective
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.120]   than a person who doesn't.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.560]   And of course, I know all things are never equal.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   And so less gifted thinkers may be far more fruitful,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   far more effective in life and ministry
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   than some thinkers are.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.400]   But that doesn't change the fact that any given person
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.280]   who has many wonderful personal gifts
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.360]   will be more fruitful and more effective
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360]   if they grow in their ability to think clearly,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.460]   logically, and biblically.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.460]   So how might we motivate everyone
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.960]   to grow in this skill?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.040]   Now, since non-thinkers are unlikely
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.860]   to be motivated by thinking,
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.160]   the most fruitful approach for Aaron, the thinker,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   is to show the kind of fruits of her own thinking
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.420]   which non-thinkers really get excited about.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.000]   And it sounds to me like Aaron is really good at this.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.480]   I mean, she talks about her affections for God being raised,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.720]   about rejoicing in God, loving Him,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.520]   wanting to lift up her voice and sing a hymn
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.760]   because of her thinking.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.020]   And all of that, it seems to me,
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.080]   is exactly what would awaken
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.680]   an emotionally hungry non-thinker to be curious.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800]   Like, how do you keep the fires
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.600]   of your emotions stoked like that?
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.480]   And then you would be able to give some illustrations
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.880]   of how thinking provides the kindling
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   that you throw on the fires of your heart.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.680]   But it may be that some of the non-thinkers
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.800]   that Aaron knows would indeed be inspired
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.640]   to push the envelope of their own thinking habits
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   if they saw biblical reasons for doing so.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.040]   Not everybody, perhaps, but some might be.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.680]   So let me mention a few.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.160]   These are helpful, I think, for everybody to consider,
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.200]   especially young people, I think,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.400]   who are just getting started
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.420]   as they discover what their brains are for.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.760]   First, the Bible repeatedly shows
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120]   that God has given us the power of thinking
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.480]   as a servant to the power of feeling
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.800]   or vigorous, proper emotions.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   1 Peter 1:13, "Gird up the loins of your mind."
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.240]   ESV translates that, "Prepare your minds for action.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.040]   "Be sober-minded.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.760]   "Set your hope fully on the grace
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.280]   "that is being brought to you."
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.000]   So what's the connection between setting your hope,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.360]   that's an emotion, fully on God?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.040]   Answer, loins of the mind have been girded up
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.320]   so that the mind can be active and effective
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.400]   in the use of the promises of God
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.840]   to throw the kindling of the Word on the fires of hope.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.200]   That's the way the Bible thinks about the relationship
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   between thinking, or the mind, and hoping, or the heart.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.300]   Second, I would point out to people
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.080]   that God commands us to think
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.200]   about what He has revealed in Scripture
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.320]   and shows us that this thinking
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.240]   is the means by which He gives understanding.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.440]   2 Timothy 2:7, "Think over what I say,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.040]   "for the Lord will give you understanding."
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   So God's giving understanding happens through our thinking.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.960]   Third, the Apostle Paul thinks that it is fundamental
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   to the way we are spiritually transformed in life
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.720]   that our minds are renewed.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.360]   Romans 12, 2, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.120]   "but be transformed in the renewing of your mind."
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.240]   So if we're gonna be transformed
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.080]   into the likeness of Christ,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.280]   Paul assumes it comes through a renewed mind.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   And what minds do is think.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   Fourth, I would point out that when Paul wrestled
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   with whether he would pray or sing in a rational way
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.560]   or a less rational way,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.360]   he insisted that the best solution was both.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.280]   What am I to do?
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   This is 1 Corinthians 14, 15.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.920]   What am I to do?
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.200]   I will pray with my spirit
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.400]   and I will pray with my mind also.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.820]   I will sing praise with my spirit
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.960]   and I will sing praise with my mind also.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   He's probably talking about tongues
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.440]   and that means his mind is not fully engaged.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.640]   He may not even know fully what he's saying.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   And when he has to choose between the emotional overflow
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.280]   of inarticulateness and the emotional overflow
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.800]   of mental clarity, he says, "Why should I surrender either?"
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.120]   I love it.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.360]   The fifth observation is the Bible treats
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.000]   some kinds of thinking as childish.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.140]   There's a kind of thinking that we should leave behind
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.320]   in childhood and move on to mature thinking.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.640]   1 Corinthians 13, 11, "When I was a child,
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.160]   "I spoke like a child, I thought like a child,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   "I reasoned like a child.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   "And when I became a man, I put away childish things."
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.200]   He's making an analogy, but the analogy is valid
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.340]   to refer to the premise that children think differently
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.960]   than adults, let's move on.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.680]   Or 1 Corinthians 14, 20, "Brothers, do not be children
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.340]   "in your thinking, be infants in evil,
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.540]   "but in your thinking, be mature."
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.640]   Or to put it another way, Philippians 3, 15,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.180]   "Let those of us who are mature think this way.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.980]   "And if in anything you think otherwise,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.080]   "God will reveal that to you."
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   So if the so-called non-thinkers that we know
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   are moved by the scriptures, maybe these kinds of passages
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.380]   would stir them up to apply themselves
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.020]   in ways they never have.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.540]   But I'm gonna end like this, I'm gonna circle back for Erin
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.540]   and simply say that she should keep on enjoying
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.040]   the fruits of the emotions and affections
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.300]   that your biblical thinking is awakening.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.300]   Because those kinds of fruits, those robust, proper,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.920]   Bible-saturated, truth-based emotions
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.260]   are the most compelling argument you could give
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.300]   to non-thinkers for why they should wanna stretch
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.260]   their minds more than they have.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.100]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.360]   And with that, we end our 149th consecutive week
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.300]   of episodes, and we look forward to launching
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.300]   week number 150 on Monday.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.140]   And we plan to do so with a friend of ours,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.460]   Randy Alcorn, who has a new book on happiness
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.940]   simply titled "Happiness."
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.360]   And it's one of the year's very best books.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.640]   We're gonna talk with Randy about happiness on Monday.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.940]   Don't miss it.
