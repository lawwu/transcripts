[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   All right, so here's a key question, maybe the fundamental question for a lot of people these
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:13.120]   days. How do you create a deep life, a life that is lived on purpose, a life that the people who
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.880]   know you find to be in a quite literal sense, remarkable. When we pursue this, and again,
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.000]   I think in the pandemic and post pandemic period, more people are caring about this and explicitly
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.320]   pursuing this than we've seen in a long time. When you pursue this, there are some common traps. It's
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.320]   a grand thing to go after and it's easy to get wrong. Today, I want to talk about arguably the
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.960]   most common trap faced by people trying to cultivate a deep life. I'll explain the trap
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.440]   and why it doesn't work and then talk briefly about what works better. All right, so we've
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.240]   already defined the deep life. That's my term for something that has been around for a very long
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.320]   time. As we mentioned, a life that's intentional, a life that's lived on purpose, focused on the
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.920]   things you care about, reduces to things that you don't, a life that other people find remarkable.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.400]   Now, when people get this idea, that this is what they want to do, that they look around and say,
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   what am I doing right now? This job I have is monotonous or nihilistic. I don't know why I
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.480]   live where I live. I'm on my phone all the time. I'm sort of just distracted and diverted. I don't
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.920]   feel like I have control over my life, but I want to do something interesting with it. I only have
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.320]   one life. I want to do something interested with it. When people get this impulse, which I think
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.080]   is a fantastic impulse, they realize they're not quite sure how to do it and they fall back on a
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.640]   common mistake, which I call the grand goal strategy. So the grand goal strategy says,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.120]   if you want to make your life more purposeful, come up with a really appealing grand goal to pursue
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.480]   with the idea that if you accomplish that goal, your life will be better.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.880]   So it really focuses your attention. There's a few different variations of the grand goal
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.320]   strategy that are common in terms of what it aims at. One has to do with the radical change
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   in your life circumstance. So this variation of the grand goal strategy is let's move to the woods.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.840]   Let's move to the island in the South Pacific. Let's rebuild my life around
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   triathlon running. Some sort of major change to your life. Move to the big city is a common one.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   Move to the country is another common one. So it's often about setting, but not always. It can
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.040]   also be about just something about the circumstance of how you live your life.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.720]   Here's another example of this. It's not setting related.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   Financially speaking, we have the FIRE movement, the Financial Independence Retire Early movement
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   that picked up in the 2010s. And it had this idea that if you're very aggressive about
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.200]   saving money and living cheaper, you can reach financial independence
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.280]   after about 10 years. So maybe in your thirties, you don't have to work anymore. You can live
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.760]   cheaply and live off of the returns of investments. That's another example of a grand goal
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.160]   that's going to change everything. I don't have to work anymore. So a radical lifestyle change,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.440]   common category. Another common category that the grand goal strategy applies to is the dream job.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.760]   Hey, if I could follow my passion to the job I'm meant to do,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:52.960]   if I could just get the job as the television writer or the standup comedian or the college
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.520]   professor, or whatever it is, but here's my passion. Here's my dream job. If I could just
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.160]   make my job, my dream job, then my life would be better. Common application of the grand goal
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   strategy. Another is just achievement focus. This is very familiar to the sort of Ivy League milieu
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.080]   in which I sort of came up in. I'm actually going to my 20-year anniversary, not anniversary,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.920]   what do they call it? Reunion? - You're going?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.480]   - 20-year college reunion at Dartmouth College in a couple of weeks.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.520]   - We have ours too. I'm not going. - Yeah, we're going.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.200]   - I go to enough Tufts things like for lacrosse. - Yeah, they're for lacrosse. Yeah. I'm going to
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   go to mine. But anyways, that crowd, there is this sort of pre-professionalism often of like,
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.560]   if you can just reach a certain level of achievement, that will fix everything, right?
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.120]   So now you have like a focusing grand goal to go after. It's if you can get into the good law school
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.800]   and from the good law school, get into the big firm and in the big firm, get partner and from
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.520]   partner, get equity partner, boom, life will be good. That's what, if you could just get there,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.480]   life will be good. You get in the medical school and you get the good residency and then you get
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   the good attending position, then you get the good, it's this idea of like the achievement.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.720]   Or if I can, in banking, make it up to this level, the MD level where I'm really pulling it in,
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.440]   that's where it's going to happen. Or in academia, if I could just get to like be a full professor,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.080]   that's it. That's when the happiness will come, right? So there's this sort of achievement version
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   of the grand goal strategy, where you focus on reaching a particular achievement. And finally,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.160]   and this is the one that comes and goes, I think most dramatically throughout the last 150 years
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.600]   or so, is this idea of, okay, if I can just fully commit to a singular ideology that can structure
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.160]   my existence and understanding of value in the world, then that's going to do it. Like a cause
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.920]   based ideology that I can just give myself over to, maybe that is going to give me a life that
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.400]   feels like it's intentional. So that's the grand goal approach. It's what most people do.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.080]   Let's do something big. It makes sense, by the way, because A, you get reward right away with
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   the grand goal approach because there is the rewards of aspiration, the thinking about this,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.840]   I'm going after this. What's it going to be like when I move to the country or don't have to work
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:17.280]   anymore? Or I am allotted for my commitment to the cause or get that equity partner status, right?
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.200]   We get enjoyment almost right away just thinking about the big change. Two, focus is simple.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.920]   Focus is nice. I'm orienting around this one thing. We like focus. There's a pleasing clarity
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.840]   to it. And often the things pursued aren't bad things. It's fine to look for a job that seems
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.960]   interesting. It's fine to achieve in your job, right? To sort of move up the ranks, that's fine.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.920]   Having some sort of ideology that plays an important part in your life might be a big
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.440]   structuring part of your life. None of this stuff is necessarily bad too. So it's not as if in the
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.720]   back of your head, you're looking at these grand goals and say like, "This really isn't good for
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.800]   me." They're fine. They're probably not bad for you. But it doesn't typically lead to people
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.320]   feeling like they have achieved a deep life. There's a few problems with this strategy.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   One, the grand goal strategy limits our options. We're not very creative when it comes to thinking
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.640]   about sweeping goals to change our life. There's only so many ideas that tend to be out there and
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.000]   they're pretty common. It's moving to a radical place. It's here are the typical jobs people
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.560]   in my situation make and so take. And okay, I want to do really well in one of those jobs.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.920]   When it comes to ideology, there's only usually a couple of them that are swirling around as
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.440]   being interesting. There's usually like one left-wing one and one right-wing one and maybe
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.640]   a couple others. There's not that many options. So you're actually leaving a lot of options for the
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.720]   nuanced cultivation of an interesting life get left on the table when you're looking
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.040]   for big grand swings you can take. So it reduces our imagination. It puts people into
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.600]   sort of narrow buckets of possibilities. Two, let's say you accomplish a grand goal.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:10.000]   Typically that only impacts a single area of your life. There's lots of different aspects that make
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.960]   up your subjective day-to-day experience and whether that is positive or negative. The grand
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.840]   goals typically just focus on one piece of that life. So at best, they'll improve that piece of
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   your life while leaving the other pieces of your life the same. At worst, they actually make other
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.360]   pieces of your life much worse. You know, in the pursuit of a particular achievement, all of these
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.520]   other things that matter to you in life get squashed or pushed out of the way as you have to
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.400]   drive for the really long hours to sort of make the achievement happen. In the pursuit of the
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.200]   radical change to move to the country, you get cut off from other people. You get cut off from the
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.680]   sort of life of the mind and energy of the city that you used to like before. The schools are
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.440]   weird. You don't get along. At worst, this is what happens is by focusing on one thing, other things
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:04.800]   in your life also get worse. Three, it bypasses other sort of less sexy but critical steps to
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.560]   taking control of your life because you can just fixate on, "I'm just going after this thing."
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.680]   So one of the things we talk about a lot on this show is actually the importance of
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.480]   getting your act together, developing a sense of discipline, organizing your life and your time,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.560]   right? This is really important for sustainable changes. The grand goal strategy has you just
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.000]   bypass this because it's just more exciting to think about the big change or the big goal you're
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   going for and you bypass these sort of more tactical skills that are probably necessary
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.400]   for sustainable change, which means, and this is sort of the final nail in the coffin of the grand
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.480]   goal strategy, most people don't succeed with it. Then where are you? I put all my eggs in this
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   basket and then I lost the basket and I have nothing left. The pursuer go after, so it's time
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.320]   to get out my phone or start playing the video games or get lost on Instagram. You give up if
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.080]   your only conceivable path towards a deep life is doing something major. When you're unable to
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.440]   succeed with something major, what are you then left with?
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.800]   Hey, it's Cal. I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   then you need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:26.160]   Without Burnout. This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.280]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow. I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:40.000]   Check it out. Now let's get back to the video. All right. So what works instead? Well, of course,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.760]   I talk about on the show a lot, my vision for how to more sustainably and reliably cultivate
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.840]   a deep life. Let me just go through a couple of the big ideas here quickly. We talk about this a
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.040]   lot, but let's go through the big ideas quickly. Step one, before you even come up with your big
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.520]   ideas and get the aspiration of thinking about living on Maui while living off of your investments
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.360]   and surfing all day, get organized, get disciplined. That's actually the better place to start.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.120]   Discipline is an identity, not a trait. It's something you see yourself as someone who can
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.080]   make progress towards important but non-urgent things, even though you don't want to or it's
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.760]   hard. This is something you get used to doing, starting small and pushing up, increasing the
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.720]   ambition of what you pursue. It changes your identity until you see yourself as a "disciplined
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.280]   person," a prerequisite for any interesting, sustainable change in your life. You got to get
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.960]   organized, have some notion of control of your obligations and time on different scales so that
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.560]   you can direct your limited resource towards stuff that's important to you in your life.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.360]   There's this pushback right now against thinking about time management and organization. There's
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.800]   this pushback that says, if you think about these topics, you're going to be some weird
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   Frederick Winslow Taylor, time optimizing, science bro, hack obsessed, noob, weirdo.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.560]   Or it could be, I want to have some structure to my time so I can do cool things with it.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.760]   Part of that structure might be reducing the amount of time I feel busy, de-optimizing.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:26.960]   The right binary here is not optimization versus some sort of chill, relaxed, aren't
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.760]   you intellectual and smart. It's not optimization versus chill. It's like control versus non-control.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:40.800]   Non-control is not a great place. Non-control, where it's like, yeah, I don't, my life is out
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.200]   of control. Things just sort of happen. That's not a great place. It's not a relaxed place.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.520]   It's a stressed place. You're busier than before. And you tend not to make traction
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.160]   on the stuff that really matters. So you don't want to become some sort of over-obsessed,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.080]   Frederick Winslow Taylor, optimized nerd. But most people actually don't go there when they
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.440]   begin to embrace some notion of structure organization. All right. So that's the first
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:12.560]   thing you have to do. Next, you got to, instead of working forward towards grand goals, find a goal,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.720]   work forward to that, everything will be fixed. Work backwards from the detailed vision of your
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.840]   ideal lifestyle. Directly address what are all the elements of what I want a day in my life to
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.240]   look like five years from now, 10 years from now. And let me directly reverse engineer these specific
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.480]   parts of my life. Now you're making progress towards specifically the things that matter,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.360]   as opposed to hoping that a big goal will, as some sort of side effect, unintentionally improve
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.560]   these things. You work backwards from a rich featured vision of ideal lifestyle, as opposed
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   to looking forward towards just a singular grand goal. Now, here's the thing. If you're doing this,
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.440]   it's like, I want to have this sort of rhythm to my life, this type of place. This is the role I
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:59.680]   want work to have in my life and the type of impact it has. My community, what do I want that to be in
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.200]   my life? How do I want to think about my health and how I'm spending my time outside of work?
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.960]   And you have these sort of visions and you're trying to build towards this. And it's very
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   systematic and it's very evidence-based. Given the opportunities and obstacles I have right now,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.240]   how can I most make progress in the next six months? It's very systematic. Doing this seemingly
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.560]   incremental work towards the actual lifestyle you want, not only is it going to more reliably
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   improve your life because you're just directly improving specific things you know resonate,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:36.480]   cool opportunities will arise. But these are going to be much more bespoke and sustainable
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.560]   than what you come up with from scratch. If I just grab a 23-year-old and say, come up with
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.440]   how you're going to change your life. Again, they have five things they're going to choose.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:50.240]   I'm going to become financially independent. I'm going to be an influencer. I'm going to move to
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.560]   the woods. It's these very common, not very creative options. But when you're instead,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.480]   really know what you're about, what you're trying to get towards, systematically moving your life
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.960]   towards these things that matter to you, that's where the really cool bespoke grand goals emerge.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:14.160]   Oh, I have an opportunity now to move here, to do this work. And it connects over here.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.240]   And you begin to actually, you know what you're trying to achieve. More often than not,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.000]   when people are systematically pursuing the deep life by looking backwards from the lifestyles,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   they end up having these really cool radical opportunities emerge. And they're things that
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.520]   no one had ever thought about before. They're bespoke, they're specific to exactly what they
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:40.000]   care about. That's where the cool radical changes happen to make people say, remark,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   "Ooh, you've got an interesting life going on." You don't start with them. It's like you get
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.720]   rolling towards, I know what I'm about. I'm in control. I'm systematically improving my life
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.680]   piece by piece. If I'm married, I'm doing this with my partner as well. Then the really cool
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.120]   opportunities, that's when they emerge. You don't start there, they emerge. So in the end,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.400]   you can end up doing pretty grand things, but it comes naturally as you much more systematically
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:10.320]   get in touch with what you want and as you move towards it. So be wary of the grand goal strategy.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.040]   It's unlikely that a single goal, no matter how grand, is going to make your life sustainably
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.280]   better. This more incremental systematic approach, not only is it going to start delivering results
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.440]   more quickly and more effective results at that, it probably will lead to some pretty radical things.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:35.600]   I never pursued a single grand vision, but as I've systematically worked backwards for my evolving
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.840]   picture of ideal lifestyle, we've ended up in some pretty remarkable places. It's like where we are
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.560]   right now, Jesse, we're in this cool HQ in the small town, above the restaurant, down the street
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.800]   from the bookstore where I know the owners and the coffee shop where I spend sort of half of every
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:56.160]   morning. In the summers, we spend in New England and I get to write books and it's all really cool.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.360]   There's some really remarkable things that in my life right now. I didn't sit down when I was 22
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.560]   and sketched that all out, but I did have an evolving understanding of my ideal lifestyle
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.640]   that my wife and I were always, okay, how do we move towards this in the current season of life
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.920]   we're in? And as we did that over time, we ended up in some pretty cool places. So there you go.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.520]   Be wary, be wary of grand goals. It's interesting, I kind of wrote about this 10 years ago in a very
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.560]   narrow way and so good they can't ignore you, but specifically about the grand goal of following
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.320]   your passion and why that specific grand goal doesn't work the way you think it's going to work.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.960]   So I didn't really realize then I was on to sort of a broader observation of
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:43.120]   skepticism surrounding grandness. All right, so we've got some good questions coming up,
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.400]   but before we get there first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:57.760]   This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp. So we're talking here about trying to cultivate a deep
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:06.560]   life. It's hard to build a life that is intentional and meaningful if you're really struggling with
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:14.080]   your own mind, right? I mean, I think this is very common, of course, in today's world, frenetic,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.120]   distracted, that you can struggle with thoughts, you can struggle with emotions, you can struggle
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.200]   with feelings. So as you think about constructing the ideal life, systematically improving the
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   relationship with your brain absolutely needs to be on our proverbial menu here. And this is going
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.800]   to mean professional help. This is probably going to mean therapy. This is where BetterHelp enters
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.640]   the scene because it makes it so easy and convenient for you to start working with a
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.920]   professional on your mental health. So if you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.640]   try. It's entirely online. It's designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.240]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist and you can
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:06.800]   switch therapists at any time for no additional charge. Do not let your vision of the deep life
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:13.920]   neglect a deep, sustainable relationship with your own mind. So take a moment and visit

[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:34.160]   I also want to talk about our longtime friends and sponsors at ZocDoc, a free app and website
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.200]   where you can search and compare highly rated in-network doctors near you and even instantly
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.960]   book appointments with them online. I said, and I'm going to be on theme here, I said the first
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.880]   step in cultivating a deep life is getting your act together, getting your own life organized
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.040]   before you try to improve it. Well, having healthcare, getting the appointments you need,
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.880]   seeing the doctors you need for the things that are important to you, be it preventative or an
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.720]   acute problem. This is a big part of being organized. Again, a problem that is difficult
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   for a lot of people because how do I find a doctor? How do I know if they take my insurance?
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Are they taking new patients? ZocDoc solves all that. It makes it easy, right? You can search.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.000]   Okay. I need this type of doctor nearby. Okay. Here they are. Let me filter. I want to see if
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.360]   they take my insurance. Oh, these ones do. Okay. Let me look at ratings from real patients to see
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.200]   which of these doctors do people really like. Great. Which of these are taking on new patients?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.680]   Oh, these three are. Oh, now I know exactly. Here's three doctors. They take my insurance.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.920]   They're nearby. They have good reviews. They're taking on new patients. Let me book an appointment
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.240]   right here from the app. And you're rock and rolling. So ZocDoc makes this unavoidable part
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.640]   of life, needing to get healthcare for whatever, you know, is going on. It really makes it easy.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:01.200]   I don't see why you would not use it if this is something like most people you need to do.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.160]   So there you go. So a couple of stats here. The wait time, the typical wait time to see a doctor
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.600]   booked on ZocDoc is only between 24 and 72 hours. That's it. Now I'm going to clarify this copy
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:22.960]   here, Jesse. This doesn't mean the typical waiting room time. Correct. Is 24 to 72 hours. That would
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.560]   not be as impressive. You show up at the doctor and 72 hours later you get in. No, no. They mean
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.800]   the time from when you make you'd say, I want a doctor to when you're going to that doctor is
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.080]   within a day or two, often even same day. So you don't have to stress out about, oh, my foot. I
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.760]   need to see a podiatrist. How am I going to do this? It's going to take forever. ZocDoc's got
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.080]   you covered. ZocDoc's got you covered. All right. So go to ZocDoc.com/deep and download the ZocDoc
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:54.240]   app for free. Then find and book a top-rated doctor today. That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:22:03.520]   ZocDoc.com/deep. All right, let's do some questions. First question's from Ahmed. I had
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.760]   some setbacks in my early twenties. Now I've regret for those wasted years. Do you believe
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.240]   it's too late for me to start living a deep life at the age of 27? I think Ahmed read the hidden
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.360]   fourth principle of slow productivity. Drink heavily. He really lived the fourth principle
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:26.160]   and now has regrets. Jesse, we're old now because you probably have the same reaction I do. He's
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.000]   like, "Is it too late at the age of 27?" We're like, "You're just getting started, man." I mean,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.360]   that's like the starting line. So no, of course not. Of course not. And I would not think about
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:44.640]   your years in your early twenties as wasted, right? You learned, you grew, you lived, you sort
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.080]   of figured out what you're about and what you're not about. You got things out of your system. You
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:57.040]   had experiences. Okay, this is not making me happy. Or I got caught in some grand goal to follow my
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:02.160]   passion to be like a professional dog sledder and it didn't work out. That's not wasted. That's you
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.440]   learning and developing as a human, learning about yourself, developing your sense of self at a time
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.840]   where you have the flexibility to do that without much consequences. That's a great use of your
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.160]   twenties. Not everyone was so sort of, you know, bow tie and blazer locked in as I was in my twenties.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:24.080]   Like that's one way to do it. But let's be honest, most people don't do it that way. All right.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now, one of the ideas I'm having around deep life and, you know, I'm working on like an annotated
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.760]   outline for a book about this. Like one of the ideas is a chapter I'm tentatively calling grow.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.200]   And a big idea from that chapter is your conception of the deep life. That is the
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.680]   ideal lifestyle that you're working backwards from changes through the different seasons of your life.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.320]   It might be one thing in your twenties, a different thing in your thirties, a different thing in your
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.560]   first half of your forties, a second thing in the second half of your forties, your fifties
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.320]   are going to look different than your forties. This is going to grow with different and change
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:03.840]   with different seasons of your life. Probably the vision that is the least important in terms of
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.240]   like your long-term experience of life is the vision you have in your twenties. So I don't mind
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.880]   that, you know, you weren't thinking about that in your twenties. Now's the time to think about it.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.800]   Think about this period, like age 27 to like, let's say 32 is like the next season of your life.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.320]   You've learned, you've grown. Now it's time to get serious. Let's build that lifestyle vision.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.000]   Where do you want to be in the first half of your thirties? What does your day look like?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.760]   Not just work, but all parts of your life. What are the obstacles and opportunities for moving
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.200]   closer to that vision? And let's start getting systematic about it. It's a perfect time to start.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.920]   So I'm excited for you Ahmed. You're ready to start getting after that lifestyle vision.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.480]   So put that together and get rolling. What were you like in your twenties?
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:58.320]   Were you locked in or were you Ahmeding it? I was a little of both. I went to grad school,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.000]   then I was figuring out where I wanted to live. And then I settled on DC,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.360]   started coaching, kind of like, you know, piecing together stuff that I wanted to do
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.840]   for a long term. So that's how I ended up in DC. Grad school stretches out that period.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   Like a lot of people, I was in grad school in my twenties too. Like Ahmed is not behind the
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.000]   eight ball here. So like if you're doing graduate education, you're kind of just extending your
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.080]   college experience. Like you're thinking about your studies and it's really not until you're
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.320]   done with education often that you're like, okay, now what am I trying to do here?
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.080]   I knew I wanted to move somewhere where I could establish my life.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.800]   Yeah. Man, our twenties. Well, I was in grad school, but like the situation at MIT was
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.240]   you are here. It's like you're at a NFL training camp. You are here to become a professor.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.400]   So it was kind of a focused grad school. You're like, this is what you're here for.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:56.080]   This is the lofty goal. If you fall short of this goal. Not great. So we were very focused,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.520]   you know, on like developing this very narrow set of skills,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.680]   which was a lot of people would drop out. Yeah. I mean, it's not, they don't call it dropping out,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.440]   but yeah, they don't get their PhD. Yeah. Masters. Yeah. There's a lot of that or they'll,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.320]   they'll get it, but then go to, you know, industry, which, which again, people get wrong.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.480]   People think about, oh, the best thing to do would be to go to like Google and get a lot of money,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.040]   but not in that environment. Like Google hires hundreds of people every year. You're going to
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.680]   have to program if you go there. No, no, no. Tenure track professorship. Like that was,
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   that was the vision. So I had an unusually locked in twenties. All right. What do we got next?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.680]   Next question is from Joe. I've consumed most of your content, which includes reading some of the
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.720]   comments on your YouTube videos. I see a bunch of comments of people talking about how to create deep
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.280]   life while at work. For example, a truck driver commented that it's difficult to do anything,
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.440]   but listen to music while driving as everything else is a distraction. Is this related?
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.680]   It's an interesting question, Joe. I think this probably is coming down to a definition
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:12.320]   issue. So you're seem to be relating or conflating the deep life with, I guess, like the structured
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.840]   consumption of information, the sort of exposure to books and big ideas and not spend as much time
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.800]   with just narrow distractions, which could be a part of it. But let's, let's expand our terminology
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.680]   here so we can deal with this issue better. Right. The deep life is a life that's intentional,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.160]   lived on purpose, the type that sort of seems remarkable to you and people around you. There's
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.800]   a lot of aspects of the deep life, including your work and what in the deep life you, you,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.000]   you have all the different things you're doing. You hopefully are moving towards your ideal
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.120]   lifestyle vision as opposed to moving away or being sort of unrelated to it. Work can play a
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.160]   lot of different roles in that. Right. So, you know, there's jobs, for example, that yes, are
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.280]   very attention demanding. So maybe truck driving is like that. If you need to be focused on what
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   you're doing, clearly, if you're like an emergency room doctor is going to be like that, like I'm
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.920]   focused on what I'm doing for the work and that's fine. Right. That could be very much a part of
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   your ideal lifestyle vision. It, this job helps give us the right flexibility about where we live.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.760]   I support my family on this job. It's like, it's, it's important work. I do well, right. I I'm
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.640]   building towards owning my own sort of company here, which is going to help us then do X, Y,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.880]   and Z like the, the there's no specific type of job that you need for the deep life. There's no
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.960]   specific experience of work that you have to have to achieve the deep life. What you need is intention
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:47.280]   and working from a clear lifestyle vision. So yes, there's this other aspect of the deep life where
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.960]   we talk about where people are, yeah, I'm reading interesting books and I'm being exposed to
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.920]   interesting sort of podcasts and ideas. I think that's also a key part of it as well. But that
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.400]   can be a separate part of it. And maybe that's not what you're doing during your job, but you have
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.120]   like a really nice library or reading nook you've built at your house. And when you're not out there
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.760]   driving the truck or what have you, you have like systematic reading time, whatever,
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.720]   there's lots of ways to think about it. So let's, let's expand, let's expand our definition of like
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.320]   what goes into the deep life. Many, many different types of jobs are part of building towards
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:27.200]   whatever lifestyle vision you might have fixed as being ideal. All right. Who do we have next?
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:34.320]   Next question is from Arjean. I watched your video on how to reinvent your life in four months
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   where you talk about the deep life stack 1.0. Then shortly after I watched another video that
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.320]   talked about the deep life stack 2.0. What are the differences? The value of one. So like to go
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.720]   from 1.0 to 2.0, the difference is one. No, okay. Here's what's going on. I've been, we talk about
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.880]   the deep life on the show a lot. You know, I coined a term, God, it might've been in the very
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.120]   first episode of the show. We'd have to go back and check, but in the summer of 2020, four years
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   ago, I've been experimenting of those times with different ways of thinking about, you know, how
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:13.520]   do you actually pursue this goal, including lots of analogies like stacks or like hardware versus
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.680]   software. Let's put aside for the second, those specific analogies and touch base with the broader
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.720]   program here. There's the broader program here is that I got this sense from my listeners and from
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.200]   my readers that this is a very important question. The pandemic really put this question to the
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.720]   forefront of a lot of people. And they felt like they weren't controlling their lives. They were
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.080]   just sort of bouncing around. Like, what am I doing here? I want to be in control of like what
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.160]   my life is like. I want it to be remarkable. Like, look at this life I've designed. It's like really
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:47.520]   cool focused on what I care about minimizes what I don't. Right. So it became clear during the
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.640]   pandemic that lots of people were grappling with this issue. Now, what's my approach to it? Right.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.840]   I'm not a philosopher. I'm not a theologian. I'm not like a social psychologist who studies
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:05.680]   happiness. Like, so what is my approach here? Well, my, my, my approach to this topic is we
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:13.760]   focus a lot on the what, but what sort of things does a life well live have in it? We don't focus
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.400]   enough on the how, the mechanics, the nuts and bolts of actually engineering or re-engineering
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.840]   what your day-to-day existence is like. We sort of take that for granted and focus on like,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.960]   here's what you need in it. And it's important that you have, you know, whatever, like community
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.720]   or that you have this or that we list these different attributes where we get inspired by
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.080]   these stories of my God, like, look at David Goggins is grinding after it. But we don't often
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.600]   get into the nuts and bolts mechanics of like, okay, but how do I get from here to something
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.800]   that's different? How do I get from the current life I have right now to a vision of the life
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.120]   that feels much better. And so everything I do about this topic is sort of centered on like,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.520]   let's get into the nuts and bolts. That's why I play with very specific analogies to try to put
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.560]   structure around the, the, the behaviors and the strategies and the frameworks you need to actually
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:06.400]   get to make change. So those stacks were something I was experimenting with. There's other things I
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.640]   experimented with as well. Um, where I am now is I'm sort of working on an annotated outline for a
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.120]   book on this sort of focus on the, how, instead of the, what, when it comes to engineering a more
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:24.880]   intentional life, I've sort of simplified it more. I've moved away from having to kind of cutesy of
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.520]   analogies, you know, like I kind of trust the reader, like, let me give you the ideas and
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.520]   here's, here's kind of like the sequence, but I don't need to, I don't need to use, you know,
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:40.880]   metaphors to, uh, computational structures, et cetera. So like in my current form, I kind of
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.920]   have this breaking down into five parts. You sort of have to go through these five parts in order.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.880]   I don't say it's a stack anymore. It's like, these are the things that kind of matter for doing this.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:56.160]   Uh, I start with, and again, this is, I'm working on this, so don't, don't, don't lock this in
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.040]   either, but starting with preparation. So this idea of before you get too caught up into the
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:08.400]   fun part of thinking through what your life could be like, get organized, get disciplined, right?
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.600]   You know, like, again, we always, we often look past this or sort of like, uh, my, my elite
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.320]   brethren are used to being disciplined and organized and they think it's unnecessary,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:24.800]   but people really, you need to start here. Okay. Two, get in your vision. This is like my big idea.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:29.280]   We just talked about the deep dive, working forward to a singular grand goal is unlikely
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.160]   to sustainably change your life for the better. Working backwards from a broad and detailed,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   ideal lifestyle vision, that's going to make changes that are going to directly impact the
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.040]   stuff you care about. Like that's what's gonna allow your life six months from now to be better
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.760]   than it was six months, uh, before. All right. Um, implementation is like, so how do you actually do
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:56.400]   this? How do you make progress towards a lifestyle vision? It's not trivial. You got to deal with
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.560]   rituals. You got to deal with projects, one-time projects that you pursue. You have to deal with
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:07.520]   changes. Let me change where I live. Let me change the nature of my job. How do you do rituals,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.720]   projects, and changes? How do you navigate those properly? Well, you know, you can't just take wild
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.840]   swings at it. You have to do evidence-based planning. You have to sort of, um, slowly build
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.680]   up to things there. There's a creativity to this to try to find, well, if I do this, it can affect
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.000]   three different parts of my vision in a positive way. There's a real art to the actual mechanical,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.240]   like here's what I'm now doing to make progress towards the vision. It's not so simple.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.920]   So we got to get into that thinking about rituals, projects, and changes and the, the,
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:43.680]   the subtle art of pursuing those. Um, then comes amplification. This is this idea that we talked
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.920]   about again, during the deep dive that once you're systematically moving towards your lifestyle
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   vision, opportunities for the remarkable will arise and they will not be things you could have
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.320]   predicted in advance, and they will be bespoke to your current situation and the current things you
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.960]   care about. This is where things get interesting. How do you seek out those opportunities? How do
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.840]   you vet them? How do you pull the trigger on them? Right? This is where the really cool stuff
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:13.200]   happens, but it happens kind of late in the progress. And then finally growth. This is this
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:19.680]   idea that you're, you need to keep maturing your vision of the ideal, what your ideal lifestyle
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.200]   is. This will mature over time, but you need to fuel this maturing process. Uh, you getting older
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.800]   will help, but you also have to systematically try to just mature your understanding of the world.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.200]   Like when we talk about building a vision of the ideal lifestyle, I talk a lot about seeing what
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.680]   resonates with you. Well, you can mature over time, even your mechanisms for resonance,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.320]   like the sophistication with what, uh, with what you detect things that appeal to you or not,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.920]   or what's important or not. And we get philosophy here and we get theology here. Um, we get, you
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   know, hard one wisdom here. So there's this whole sort of process of growth over time. It's just
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.720]   sort of becoming a, um, a more mature person, a more value-driven person. You get better at that.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.000]   So you don't have to be there full form when you start this process. So that's,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.200]   that's how I think about it. Now we can put this, we could call this a stack, but I don't bother
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.280]   with that anymore. So again, the summarize, you prepare that you build your vision,
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   then you implement with care. You look for opportunities to amplify and you grow over
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.120]   time. This seems to be more of what putting aside the specific things you end up pursuing.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.560]   This really gets to the how of how to pursue that in a way that's sustainable.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.840]   So I don't know. That's where I am now. That could change. Maybe I'll go back to being like super
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.240]   cutesy analogies. Again, depends, depends what mood I am. Uh, as I'm, as I'm writing my book,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.880]   maybe I'll have like a pyramid that's on a circle. So you have to have the pyramid of values that
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:52.240]   rotates on the wheels of lifestyle. Um, and then on, on top of that, you have the flavor
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.680]   of remarkability. And then as you combine these into a matrix, that gives you a probability that
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.640]   you put into a machine learning model that then spits out a graphical representation of your
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:10.000]   spirit animal. That might be where I end up instead. We'll see. Simplifying. All right.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.720]   What do we got next? Next question is from Marie. How do my husband and I design a deep
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   life with four children at or under the age of kindergarten for children at kindergarten age or
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.320]   below? All right, Jesse, this brings me back again to the last principle for slow productivity,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   drink heavily. That's the, that's your solution right there. Um, this is an absolutely critical
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:39.440]   time to be thinking about the deep life, but this question is also critical because it really,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:47.200]   again, helps us clarify what the deep life really can mean. So I'm assuming the tension in your
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.760]   question is that the vision of the deep life matches some of the things we talked about,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.240]   where, uh, there's all of these aspects of your life in which you're sort of doing interesting,
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.800]   very intentional things, and you're in very good shape and reading all these books and your job
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.720]   is in this interesting way. And you're connected and you have these interesting hobbies and you're
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.800]   like, how is this possible with four kids at kindergarten or below? And of course like that
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:14.000]   stuff isn't, that's a fire alarm type of situation. That's an all hands on deck situation,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.920]   but let's just back up a little bit. What, what really do we mean by the deep life? Well,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.400]   intentional lived on purpose. So you can apply, you're in a hard, interesting, wonderful, but
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:32.320]   difficult period of family life. You can absolutely, and should absolutely be living
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.600]   on purpose during this period. It's just what your purpose is. The intention, like what's our
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.760]   intentional vision for what these years should be like, um, is going to look very different than
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.680]   how a 27 year old will answer that question. It's going to look very different than how like a 47
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.520]   year old whose kids are older is going to answer that question right now. It's going to be focused
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:56.480]   a lot on, okay, we want to, um, develop these like little things into like reasonable humans.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.720]   We want to, um, do this without sort of being completely exhausted. We want to be able to
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.960]   find joy in this young age. The kids will never be at again. We want to be able to
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.840]   have space to find joy in that, to avoid like complete stress. Um, you get really clear about
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.080]   like, what do we want this sort of young kid period to look like? And then you work backwards
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.240]   from that vision. And then that could lead, that intention can lead to lots of interesting things.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.720]   It might be little things in terms of just how you're thinking about like activities for the
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:34.400]   kids or how your balance, the, the, the format of childcare, what you're doing with, um, what type
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:41.280]   of preschool the kids are going to, like these things you begin to get intentional about the
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.120]   match division you have. Now this could lead to even larger changes. Like we're going to change
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:52.080]   something about our work setups here, right? It's, it's a absolutely like fantastic application of
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.120]   the deep life methodology that you can imagine the role of work during this period of life is
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.920]   going to be very different than it was and what it's going to be six years from now.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.880]   There may be like a holding pattern thing we want to do here. I'm going to reduce to this.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.200]   You're going to do this. Yeah. We're not like getting ahead, but we want to make sure we keep
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.400]   these jobs, but this is going to allow us to then, uh, have much more intentional about how we deal
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.320]   with where the kids are and when we pick them up or how this happens, right? This is the time you
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:24.000]   have to be intentional. And when you're intentional here, you have to see the full picture, all of the
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.840]   aspects of your life you care about. This is a dangerous period. Like what happens sometimes
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.480]   during these kid period is that when people are not intentional about the full vision of like,
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.440]   what is our ideal lifestyle through this season of our life? And they don't, they ignore that
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.280]   they, they focus then sort of randomly on other things. Like, well, what matters to me is just
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.760]   like, I want to advance my career as fast as possible. Uh, and then like your partner says
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.200]   the same thing and then everyone is just resentful of each other and stressed all the time. It's not
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.080]   working out well, right? You just focus on like one random thing or one person is focusing on
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.640]   something about the kids. The other person's focused on something else and you're, you know,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.480]   you're not on the same page and it's not working out. Like this is the time you have to be on the
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.120]   same page and say, what does this five year period? And I would, I would say this period
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.320]   ends once all of your kids basically are in elementary school. That's the next period.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.360]   I remember this period. Well, I'm in the next period now. How do, what do we want to do in
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:23.520]   this period? Like what, what do we want this to be like all parts of your life really matters.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.560]   It might change the communities you get involved in. Uh, it changes. Maybe it changes something
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.800]   more drastically. Like now it is time. This is the time we're going to move. We want to be closer to
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.160]   family. We want to move to a place where we can be more deeply enmeshed in these communities that
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.600]   matter because we're going to need the support. We want to live cheaper so we don't have to be
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.120]   working so much because we have four kids and they're young and they're similar ages. And
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   that's just going to require a lot of time. So let's reconceive our conception, not around
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.360]   a particular career trajectories, but around a full lifestyle trajectory. That's more interesting.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.200]   This is also a good time to think ahead. Where do we want to be in the next days? Like when all of
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.400]   our kids are in elementary school so that we can be making the moves right now with that in mind as
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   well. We don't get caught off guard when we get there. Uh, my wife and I thought a lot about this,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.280]   a like how we wanted life to be when our three kids were young, but also we really early on,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:19.680]   I mean, I remember these discussions were really clearly articulating the properties of the, the
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.480]   family lifestyle we wanted during the elementary school age that we're in now. And all,
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.080]   all of our kids are sort of of that age. You know, my, my oldest is starting middle school
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.560]   next year, sixth grade, but I came from New Jersey where we had junior high that starts in seventh
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   grade. So I don't really count sixth grade. It's not an elementary school, but they're all,
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.240]   they're all, it's a completely different phase, but you know what, this thinking we did.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.920]   I remember doing this thinking when the third kid hadn't even been born yet. And the other two were
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.680]   like an infant and like a kid just starting preschool. I remember like where we were doing
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.000]   this thinking, really checking in on this, not how, not specifically, like here's specifically
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.960]   what we'll be doing in 2024, but just thinking about where we wanted to be like made a big
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.240]   difference. And it shaped a lot of decisions. And I really, we're, we're like reaping that
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.320]   benefit now. Like we've been working backwards from that, not working forwards towards a ground
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.240]   goal, not working forwards from like, all that matters is like this happens in my career.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.680]   So this is like the critical time to be thinking about the deep life, but you just have to be
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.760]   super expansive and flexible about what that means. It's intention. It's not any particular
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:28.800]   mix of things. So yeah, do this planning, do it often. This is what's going to make the
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.520]   difference between the sort of sustainable, tight, sort of wonderful family life going
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.400]   forward. And one where it's stressful and resentful and random, like you have to be
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.760]   thinking through what our lifestyle wants to be like, not this is what I'm doing. And sort of
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.080]   the other stuff is a burden or an obstacle that I'm sort of annoyed exist.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.120]   That's a good question for, for kids at or under kindergarten, that's tough.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.600]   So do you do a lot of post analysis after they're out of elementary school?
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.800]   Well, we just keep thinking about the next. Okay. Yeah. It's like, what do we want to,
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.680]   what's working, not working now? Where do we want to be in the next, like the next phase?
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.560]   And they're each different. And then we have to revise a lot because you learn things like you
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:15.040]   don't, you don't know that, oh, this is what this is really going to be like. But the key is,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.800]   and this is like a key part of the deep life methodology in general, lifestyle focus,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:25.120]   like the properties of life is what you're focusing on. Not specific, like where I want
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:32.000]   to be is this position in this job, or like we have to live in this place. When you're thinking
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.120]   about properties of lifestyle, you get flexibility and options. There's a lot of different ways we
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.560]   could get there. And then these, as I talked about these interesting opportunities for the
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.240]   remarkable come up, you're like, oh, I never even knew that opportunity existed, but you know what,
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.640]   if we did that, we could get these three things working pretty well. And you could do this and
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.520]   it, there's a flexibility to it, you know, and then this is how you're able to sort of
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   construct these bespoke intentional lives. All right. Oh, it looks like our next question.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.360]   Is this our slow productivity corner? It is. Let's get that music.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.960]   As long time listeners know, we try to have one question per episode that's related to my new book,
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout. You can find out wherever books
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.160]   are sold or at calnewport.com/slow. All right, Jesse, what's our slow productivity corner
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:35.760]   question of the week? This question is from Sean. In slow productivity, you discuss limit your
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.680]   missions. If I only have a single day job, do I have exactly one mission? And the advice is just
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.000]   for super hustlers out there. Uh, it's a good question, right? So in the principle, do fewer
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.400]   things. I talk about, you need to reduce to accomplish this. You often have to reduce what
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:46:00.640]   you're working on at various levels of abstraction. So if you just come to like your day and it's like,
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.200]   I want to do fewer things today, that might be impossible because you have a lot of things that
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.480]   need to be done, right? Because maybe you have many projects you're working on and each of the
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.640]   projects has a lot of things they need you to do. So you have to also limit your projects so you
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.040]   don't have too many things being generated that have to be done, but it might be hard to limit
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.080]   your projects. If you have a lot of bigger missions or initiatives you're working on,
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.000]   each of which have to generate projects, you can't limit projects. So you have to
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.920]   move up even higher and limit the, uh, the missions or initiatives you're working on.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.200]   So you have to sort of limit from the top to have this reduction carry through all the way to like
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.360]   what you're actually doing on the day to day where it makes a difference. So that's what limit your
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:46.560]   missions means. Um, a single day job can have multiple missions, right? All this is, is just
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.400]   major initiatives that you're pursuing. Like this is something I'm pursuing and trying to do well
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.960]   and want to be known for. In some day jobs, it's really clear, like this is just what you're doing.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.080]   You're in sales. You're trying to move sales numbers. That's all that matters. But a lot of
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:03.440]   jobs, there's a lot of opportunities to take on multiple big initiatives. Maybe some are internal
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:08.480]   facing reform in your organization. This is like a product strategy. This is like a technology
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   strategy. Limit those, right? This is what I'm doing in this job. If at all possible. Like this
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:22.480]   is the thing I'm really working on. Hold me to it. I'm trying to get this product line big.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.680]   I'm trying to overhaul the way we do digital marketing plans, whatever it is,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.920]   try to keep that simplified. That will generate fewer total projects, which means there's fewer
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.640]   total tasks that you have to work on. Your days can give you more breathing room, and then you can
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.200]   focus on doing that work really, really well. Of course, the double-edged sword of limiting
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.520]   your missions is you actually have to deliver. You're basically saying, this is what I'm doing,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.720]   but hold me to it. The appeal of having many missions is you can be like, I'm really busy.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:56.160]   And I have, I'm doing a lot of things. I just seem in a pseudo productive sense is like,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.840]   I'm a useful person here. You lose that comfort of freneticism standing in for actual value
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.040]   production when you say, no, no, look, this is what I do. I want to focus on this. Hold me to
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.880]   it, but I want to focus on this. That's the double-edged sword. You are going to be accountable.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.040]   But on the other hand, it gives you breathing room. And when you have breathing room,
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.920]   I don't have the administrative overhead of 20 tasks at the same time. You can actually
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.080]   get work done at a high level of quality and do so in a way that's much more sustainable,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.320]   much less frenetic and stressful. That's a good question. It doesn't matter.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.920]   Knowledge work is so flexible, like day job, non-day job, entrepreneurial, big organization.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:37.440]   We can get overloaded in all of those situations. And in all those situations, limiting missions can
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.720]   really matter. All right. That's our Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:53.440]   All right. Do we have a call today, Jesse? We do have a call.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.960]   Excellent. Let's hear this. Here we go.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.800]   Hi, Cal. My name is Christina, and I work in finance. I took five years off to have children
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:07.680]   and keep them at home, and I'm just now back at work full-time this year. I've noticed that my
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:13.200]   ability to focus has really taken a hit since having young children. I don't do any social
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.800]   media or anything like that, but I really am struggling with keeping focused for long periods
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   of time, not just on complex concepts, but also on those little detailed things that you have to
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   keep track of, whether it's like data validation, things like that that are just really hard to
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:41.360]   concentrate on. So any tips would be very much appreciated. I really would like to get very,
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.760]   very good at my job and make up for some of that lost time. Thanks so much.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.400]   Well, Christina, this is hard.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:48.900]   Hi, Cal.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:56.320]   This is hard. It is a common problem. We had an interview about this, a professor from
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:02.640]   Brown who worked on psychology and work. Yael, I forgot her last name right now.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.560]   Anyways, we had this really interesting interview. And Christina, this reminds me of what you're
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:13.040]   talking about here, because I had this question. I asked her, I said, I don't know if it's pushback,
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:21.600]   but just frustration, especially from listeners who are moms, who are frustrated about the idea
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:29.360]   of deep work. And well, who's taking care of the kids while this person's doing deep work?
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.280]   And I was like, I don't understand this. Deep work, this is a very abstract thing,
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.920]   very computer science systemic way of non-emotional way of thinking about this.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.400]   When working on knowledge work, you can do it with uninterrupted focus
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.920]   or with context switching. And if you're context switching, your brain doesn't work as well
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:51.440]   and you don't produce good stuff and it takes longer. So we should, in knowledge work in general,
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   recognize that uninterrupted focus is important and try to protect that, et cetera.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.240]   It's like, what is this? I don't understand what, what could you be upset about this,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:03.040]   this like abstract concept of focus produces more than uninterrupted focus. I'm not saying,
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.320]   not making any prescriptions of like how much of this you should have or how you should find this,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   whatever. And the guest, the psychologist from Brown, she was like, yeah, but there's a,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:19.040]   the frustration is like, especially if like you're a mom, but in this context is like,
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:26.480]   you just have a much harder time finding unbroken focus. Even if it's not, you have the,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.600]   you can literally block off the time. You're thinking about the kids, you're thinking about
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.640]   the school you're thinking about, and whether this is like cultural or whether this is, you know,
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.520]   just it's genetic it's in our species who knows, but it's like, if you have a much harder time,
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:46.000]   just putting your focus on something. And it's frustrating. It's frustrating that you can't
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.240]   focus as much and the focus really matters. And now people that you're probably smarter than and
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.240]   more capable than are going to be moving ahead just because it's, they just don't care as much
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   that the men don't, it's just not grabbing their attention as much. And it's frustrating. That's
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.880]   why they're frustrated. It's not a fundamental, it's not a mistake in the idea, just the abstract
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:09.680]   idea of how cognitive processes unfold. This idea that context, switching produces less capacity
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   than focus. It's like, it's a, it's a frustration about particular group of people that are like,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:20.880]   I can't do that as much. And yet no one is acknowledging enough that like, this is different.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.200]   This is hard, which is all to say, Christina, like what you're going through is very common.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.440]   Something I've learned. If you have young kids at home, yeah, it's harder to focus.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.160]   That's probably evolution. It's probably a good thing for the history of our species.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.440]   That you're, I mean, it's bad for you, but probably a good thing for our history of our species that
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.920]   I just having a hard time focused on data analysis right now because, you know,
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:51.760]   human kids are hard to keep alive. It grabs our attention. Okay. So, I mean, that's validating,
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:55.520]   but it's not solving your problem. But I just wanted to start with that because it took me a
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:02.240]   long time again, with my, my approach to the world, which is very non-emotional, very private
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:08.240]   talking about abstractions. And this is the way things unfold can hit up against other ways and
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.520]   other things going on in the world. All right. So what, what can you do about this? First,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.640]   you can go easier on yourself. It's just, you know, look, I'm a different person.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:20.000]   I have young kids and I really care about, and I have to keep them alive. That is a very hard job.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.200]   I'm not talking physically, I'm talking cognitively. So you can just kind of,
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.640]   there's, there's a sort of going easier on yourself here of like, yeah, this is,
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:33.200]   this is a different me than it was pre kids. And just being okay with that. It's not 29 year old
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.520]   me where I could just go at it eight hours a day, concentrated on spreadsheets. Like I can't do that
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:44.480]   anymore. And it's for good reason. So it's not a bad thing. It's just a new reality. You know,
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:52.000]   it's like when the baseball pitcher, women are going to love this analogy, Jesse,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.000]   when the baseball pitcher gets older in their career and they can't throw 95 miles per hour
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:07.600]   anymore. And it's like Trevor Williams for the nationals. You change the way you pitch. It's
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.560]   like, okay, so I can't do that anymore. But I'm, I've been doing this for a long time. I'm kind of
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.160]   like I'm more mature and I'm wiser. So now I'm going to, I'm going to throw good, you know,
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.680]   89 fastball is going to play up because I've got my, my splitter is really working. Yeah. I've
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:29.600]   learned by the way, like what, um, women who are frustrated about men, what they really love is
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.120]   to have this explained in terms of analogies to Trevor Williams, somebody else's analogy about it
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.800]   earlier too, for the love of the game with Kevin Costner, he's on the mound, like clear the
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:44.400]   mechanism. Is that that movie? I, it was either you talking about or somebody else within like
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:50.480]   the last couple of days for love. I think that's for love the game. Yeah. Yeah. Clear the mechanism,
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.960]   clear the mechanism, Christina. All right. Um, so yeah, you're different than you were before.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.080]   And we all are like, here's an interesting, like I'm different than I was before. It's weird.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:06.160]   You know, I'm super generalizing, but as like a dad of young boys, all my kids are boys.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.600]   Like for me, the like real change and sort of my ability to just lock into work actually came when
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.960]   they got a little bit older, like closer to elementary school age, because the boys needed
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   this sort of dad time all the time. Like they needed specifically dad time as part of their
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:24.720]   development as humans. That was a huge sap on cognitive energy that would have otherwise,
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.000]   you know, um, gone into work. So again, like babies were more survival mode for me. Like,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.920]   how do I just like help keep these alive and like keep my wife from going crazy? Like young boys,
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.960]   it's like, Ooh, they need this. Why am I at work? So we, we different people get these different
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.920]   things at different times, but families can change who you are and how you actually approach the
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:50.080]   energy, uh, of your work. So I think that's good. So what we have to do is like, what I'm trying to
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:57.680]   do is what you have to do is the knowledge work equivalent of the older pitcher learning to use
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:05.600]   obfuscation and deception to keep his ERA low. And there's a term for this. And I wrote a whole
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.920]   book about it. Slow productivity, right? Slow productivity is my way of thinking about how
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   do you still like produce stuff that moves the needle and matters when you can't just get after
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.080]   it and just be locked in busy and outwork everyone out, energy, everyone out, focus everyone. That's
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.400]   kind of what that book is about. And I've talked about it, like my three boys getting to this age
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.520]   where they needed all my time and that sort of shift in my, um, understanding of the world.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.200]   Like that was a big inspire inspiration for working on the ideas that became slow productivity. I
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.680]   needed it for myself, right? It was partially why I worked on that book. And so what are these
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.840]   ideas and slow productivity? Well, okay. We need to work on fewer things at the same time. This
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.960]   doesn't mean accomplish fewer things, but acknowledging we already have a lot of things
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.520]   on our heads. We need to minimize administrative overhead. We need to minimize multitasking and
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.880]   context switching. So let's be more sequential. Let me do this, do this really well. Now I'm
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.760]   going to work on this. Let me work on this. Well, there's a lot of things on my plate.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.600]   Let me divide between the small number of things I'm actively working on and the things I'm waiting
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:08.000]   to work on. And the things I'm waiting to work on, I'm not entertaining administrative overhead on
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.720]   emails and meetings. I'm not doing on these things yet. They're here. You can see their status.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.440]   You can see it marching down the line. And when it gets to active, then I'll work on it.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:20.800]   So we need to work on fewer things. We need to work out a more natural pace,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:25.920]   be much more realistic about how long things are actually going to take and be okay with that.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:30.960]   Be okay with the idea that, you know, I might not be super frenetic on Tuesday, but at the end of
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.040]   this quarter, I can point to, I did these three things and these three things really matter.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.000]   That brings us to the third principle, which is what all of us sort of family adult knowledge
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.200]   workers have to super embrace is obsess over quality. We are going to earn flexibility.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:52.160]   We're going to earn freedom from frenetic accessibility. We're going to gain autonomy
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:58.640]   by getting really good at the things that matter. This is, I'm specializing on this. Hold me to it.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:05.760]   I do this really well. So we have to break our relationship to our jobs out of the grips of
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.640]   pseudo productivity, which just says activities. What matter? If I could see you doing a bunch of
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.280]   stuff that I know that at the very least, you're not, not productive. We want to escape that
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:21.040]   and be measured instead on output outcomes over time, really valuable stuff that other people
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:26.000]   can't do when you're seeing. And again, you're not new to the job. You were in this job before
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.560]   you took time off, right? You're more mature. You understand what matters, what doesn't matters.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:35.760]   You're not sort of, you know just young and energetic anymore. You can begin to carve out
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.600]   what we're all trying to do. I do this thing really well. I do it better than these people.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.280]   I deliver. I can do that by working on fewer things at the same time, more natural pace,
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.760]   like all of this matters. Slow productivity is, if anything, a game plan for parents
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:56.560]   to rebuild their relevance, be a useful pitcher, even when they can't do the young man or young
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.360]   woman's game anymore of just throwing a lot of pseudo productivity at it. All right. So there's
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.000]   like a lot of things we're talking about here, Christina, but I think it's a good discussion.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.280]   So one, we have the validation of the frustration mothers in general in knowledge work, that
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:16.320]   frustration of, I can't do the focus I used to be able to do. And you know, like the new dads can,
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:21.520]   and that's frustrating. We're not talking about that's frustrating too. So yeah, we are different
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:26.160]   families. Other types of things can change us. It's not, it's not bad. It's just, this is,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.680]   we're now a different person. How do we still build a good game? And that brings us number
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.560]   three, slow productivity. We've got to figure out how to shift ourselves and how other people
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.200]   see us from activity-based notions of productivity to outcome-based notions of productivity.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:44.320]   If your field makes that impossible, if your employer makes that impossible,
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:50.000]   that's just not the way they operate, but you know what you want. You have this vision of like
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.720]   what working life, the slow productive version of working life, it's not a bad motivation to
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:02.160]   look for changes. So how do I shift over to a change that does make that happen? This part
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.440]   of finance, not here, but here, my own thing or here, or the lawyer. I know a lawyer who did this
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.080]   really good at the type of laws she does saying, I am not interested in the partner track.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.920]   So we're going to, I'm going to leave the partner track and now I can actually control my hours.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.800]   And so instead of trying to build a maximum number of hours, I'm going to build 35 hours.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.280]   Okay. Yes. I've lost the, like, I'm on my track to be an equity partner,
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.120]   but I make a lot per hour. And we moved over here to the mountains where it's much cheaper
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:38.720]   because this, this work can be done remotely. And this works out really well. I'm doing really hard
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.920]   super skilled work. It's very valuable to my clients. I'm just doing half as much as I would
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.600]   have to do to be on the partner track. But I'm not thinking about maximizing like salary. I'm
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.200]   thinking about having a good salary for those hours is a great salary for those hours. And we
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.920]   can live like Kings over here. Right? So there's, there's it. Once you know what you're trying to do,
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.240]   I'm a different person. I need a slow productivity as opposed to a pseudo productivity approach to my
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.000]   work. There's a huge number of options there where you can still be doing stuff that matters,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.760]   supporting your family, being engaged, but these other parts of your vision,
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.160]   the ideal lifestyle can also be preserved. So this is like a good approach to these questions,
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:18.400]   as opposed to just drastic changes. Jobs are bad. I don't want to, I don't want to work anymore,
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.480]   or I shouldn't have to change anything then from what I was when I was 26 or whatever.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.400]   So like, whatever, I'm just going to, you know, grind it out and we're going to make this happen.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.600]   We have like subtlety here. We understand the problem. We're working towards a broader vision,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.040]   the ideal lifestyle. We have a sense of what craft can be post kids, the slower productivity
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:42.240]   notion of craft and saying, can I get that in my job? And if not, what's the closest thing
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.360]   to preserve as much of my career capital as possible, where I can get that. I mean,
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.400]   all of this is about clarity and specificity and what's going on, why it's going on, what we want,
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.480]   how we can change it, how we can get there. The more clear and systematic we are, the better
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.560]   decisions we make, the better changes we make. We avoid the drastic grand gestures. We avoid the
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.960]   regrets of making the big change that didn't really fix things. So Christina, there's a lot
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.920]   packed into this simple question. I think it was, it was good to unfold, but I think the main point
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.360]   is, and again, I can't emphasize this enough for the women in your life, try to analogize all their
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:18.240]   problems to like obscure baseball things. That is, that is always a winner, Jesse.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.720]   It was a Yale Sean Braun.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.120]   Yale Sean Braun. Oh, I liked that interview. What episode was that?
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   I found I was searching. It was a while ago.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.280]   It was a while ago. Yeah, that was a cool, that was a cool episode because if I remember correctly,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.920]   she studied, she's a Brown professor, psychologist who studies psychology and work.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:42.560]   And among other things, the psychology of gender and work. And it was fascinating interview.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:50.720]   All right. We've got a case study. Case studies are where people send in like a report on how
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.200]   things are going with applying the type of advice we talk here about the show to their own life.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:01.280]   We like these, please send them in. How do they do that, Jesse? Just go to the question submission
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.120]   form. And one of the options is case study. Yeah. Go to the deeplife.com/listen. And then at top,
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.640]   you can click on the survey link and then. Yeah. Send these in.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.520]   There's an option for case studies. Or they can just email me.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.400]   Or email jesse@calnewport.com. Especially deep life stuff, because I'm thinking about a book on
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.960]   this. Send in those case studies about you systematically cultivating a deep life. I love
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.200]   those. All right. Today's case study comes from Mark. It has a hidden question inside of it. So
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:34.000]   it's a case study plus bonus question. Mark says, firstly, thanks for all your work that you have
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   put into your books and podcasts. I discovered you very late at the end of 2023 and have implemented
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.640]   a lot of your ideas into my life since then, including the digital declutter en route to
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:52.960]   embracing digital minimalism, time block planning, deep work, intentional living,
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:00.160]   reading as default entertainment. This has improved my life immensely, both in and out of
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.360]   work. Since your work has had such an impact on my life outside of work, I'm always excited by the
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.480]   deep life segments on the podcast and learning more about it. On that note, do you have any book
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.520]   recommendations aside from your own that would compliment cultivating a deep life outside of work?
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.320]   So far from past recommendations, I have two books, Walden and Designing Your Life. I'd love
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.440]   to hear more. You'd consider good reading before you release a deep life book in the future.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:32.240]   Yeah, Walden's a good one. I increasingly think about Thoreau and Walden as the original person
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:39.600]   in early modernity grappling with this question of how do I design my life? Not within an existing
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.440]   structure of meaning, but feeling like you had to come up with that from scratch and
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.560]   systematically experiment with what do I want to do with my life? Thoreau and Walden is sort of
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:56.960]   patient zero for that type of thinking. Here's the thing, looking for books that are about
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.800]   how to build a deep life, specifically about a deep life, will only get you so far. I mean,
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.880]   my book, when I eventually write it, of course, will be must reading. But really, what you should
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.400]   be focusing on much more than that, Mark, is books that give you intimations of what your own deep
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.720]   life should include. What you're looking for is resonance. I am reading about this person.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:24.240]   I'm reading about this thing. It's not a book about specifically how to make your life better.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.720]   It's a book about someone's life, and it resonates. You want to write that down.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.120]   Then you watch this documentary. Something about that resonates. You write that down.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.400]   You come across an article in a magazine. Why is this resonating? You write that down.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.960]   An Instagram picture. Why is this particular Instagram story capture my attention? You
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.160]   write that down. Have one notebook that you're writing all this down, and you're trying to
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.320]   capture these intimations of what's important to you. Then eventually, you can take these
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.080]   observations of all these things that resonated and extract more general properties.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:06:04.800]   Oh, the things that resonate tend to be slower living outdoors or craft or energy and the
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:11.600]   freneticism of the city and the tales of people living in brownstones in New York and going to
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.040]   the club. Whatever it is, you begin to extract the general properties from these specific examples of
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.440]   things that resonate. That's how you begin to craft your ideal lifestyle vision. I would care
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.520]   more about that, Mark, than reading specifically about how to think about your life or how to
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:31.920]   change your life. Read broadly, look for what resonates, write it down, and then extract
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:39.360]   properties. It can be surprising. I've mentioned before, for myself, there's some Hawaii stuff
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:46.080]   that's resonated. Laird Hamilton's house in Malibu and how he lives out there and how his
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.920]   days structure while he's waiting for the big waves to come. That resonated with me, not because
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.160]   I want to live on a pineapple plantation in Malibu or not because I want to surf big waves or not
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:02.320]   because I want to even live in Hawaii, but there's deeper things in that about seasonality,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:08.560]   deep to shallow work ratio, the work to other parts of life, variation and intensity,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.800]   followed by times with intense focus and things that aren't work. There's subtler properties that
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:20.960]   resonate. Why did I come across that? Watching the documentary, a combination of there's a
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.760]   Laird Hamilton documentary, which is great. I recommend it. And the Susan Casey book, The Wave,
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.320]   which is like half of that book is a biography of Laird Hamilton and the other half is about
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:34.640]   the science of big waves. Fantastic book. I recommend it. But anyways, I don't know why
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.000]   that resonated at the time, but I just made a note of that. And then over time I extracted,
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.840]   oh, there's some general properties in here that are important to me. So that's what I care about
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.840]   more. Mark is finding things that resonate, then care more about that than finding a specific
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.120]   instruction about shaping your life. Just wait for my deep life book and that'll solve that for you.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.600]   In the meantime, figure out what that vision involves. All right, we got, we're coming up
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.360]   to our final segment. We're going to talk about the books I read, but first hear from another
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:11.120]   sponsor. I want to talk in particular about Notion, a place where any team can write, plan,
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.960]   organize, and rediscover the joy of play. It's a workspace designed not just for making progress,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.600]   but getting inspired. So Notion allows you to combine your notes and documents into one space
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.600]   that's simple and beautifully designed. And now it increasingly has the power of AI built right
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.520]   into it, not a separate AI tool or browser tab, but just AI functionality built right into Notion's
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:42.240]   tool. What I like about Notion is that it allows you to build these sort of custom workspaces or
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.760]   tools for the information that matters to you and your business. You can do it in ways that's like
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.400]   very bespoke and useful, right? I mean, in my book, A World Without Email, I talk a lot about
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:57.680]   having processes for how you manage repeated work. So it's not just free-for-alls with attachments
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:01.760]   and emails and frenetic Slack. Notion is one of these great tools for building them.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:10.800]   Our ad agency, for example, built a really cool way of tracking ad reads in Notion,
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.880]   where it connected information to these different views. So we could see, for example,
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:21.120]   here's the ad reads for this upcoming podcast episode, but then we could click on a particular
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:26.240]   ad read. Okay, here's the advertiser, like here's the script for it. We could go in there afterwards
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.200]   and say, here's the link and timestamps for exactly when we did these ads. But then we could
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.240]   have another view and say, why don't you show me all the ads we did for this advertiser? And
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.160]   then a different view shows us all of that. Oh, here's everything we've done for that advertiser.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.240]   You could change the view, you could manage this. It gave us a workflow that allowed us to
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:49.920]   have a very complicated advertising rhythm for our show without it having to just be like chaos of
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.840]   everyone just emailing things back and forth and getting things wrong. So you can build these sort
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:00.080]   of custom data-driven things. The AI power to this, though, just brings it up to the next level.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Now, one of the things I like about the new AI tools is you can just type right into there.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:11.840]   Oh, I'm looking for, in our case, an ad read we did for this type of company. I forgot its name.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.160]   I think we did it a couple, like last year. And the AI is like, oh, here's where it is. And it
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.000]   brings you over there. Or where's our marketing reports from last quarter? I forgot where those
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:25.600]   here they are, right? So like AI is now being integrated to this. So not only can you create
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.160]   these custom ways of working with your data, you can find data conversationally. It just makes
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.720]   these tools all the more powerful. So whether you're a Fortune 500 company or a freelance
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.160]   designer, whether you're starting a new startup or a student juggling, like some clubs you're
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   running, Notion is for you. You can manage your work and your workflow. So try Notion for free
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:54.080]   when you go to Notion.com/cal, but do that in all lowercase letters. That's Notion.com/cal
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.280]   and start turning your ideas into action. When you use our link, you'll be supporting our show.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:06.560]   So make sure you go to Notion.com/cal. I also want to talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:12.320]   Look, using the internet without ExpressVPN is like having a first aid kit, but not keeping it
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   stocked up. You know, most of the time you'll probably be fine. But what happens when you get
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:21.600]   into that horrible accident and there's nothing there in that first aid kit to help you stem
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.880]   the bleeding? That's what it's like to use the internet without ExpressVPN because every time
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:33.680]   you're connected to an unencrypted network, like at a cafe or hotel or an airport, any hacker on
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:40.160]   the same network can gain access to your personal data. It doesn't take much technical knowledge to
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.840]   hack someone. A cheap piece of hardware that like any smart 12 year old could use is all you need.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.560]   And trust me, people are looking for this data. Hackers can make up to $1,000 per person selling
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:58.640]   your personal information on the dark web. ExpressVPN can protect you from that. And the
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.680]   way it works is ExpressVPN runs on your computer. And so instead of you, you know, connecting to
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:09.600]   that wireless access point at the airport, instead of just talking to that access point, okay,
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.000]   here's the website I'm going to, you know, here's my password, whatever. When you use a VPN like
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.920]   ExpressVPN, it encrypts what you're saying right there on your local machine. And it sends in an
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:28.320]   encrypted, unbreakable message. It sends to a VPN server. This is what this person really wanted to
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.080]   do. It unencrypts the message and the VPN server talks on your behalf. So that the hacker that's
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:37.440]   sitting there at the airport or at the hotel or at the coffee shop, all they can learn is that you
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.520]   have an encrypted connection, what they call an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server. They can't steal
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:47.200]   your information. So maybe nine times out of 10, no one's trying to hack you, but it's that 10th
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.800]   time where really bad stuff can happen. ExpressVPN protects you. So secure your online data today by
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:04.000]   visiting expressvpn.com/deep. That's e-x-p-r-e-s-s-vpn.com/deep. And you will get an extra
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.560]   three months free, but only when you go to expressvpn.com/deep. All right, Jesse, let's
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.960]   get to our final segment because this is our first episode in June. As I try to do at the beginning
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.520]   of each month is I want to review the five books I read in the month preceding. So I want to go over
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:32.240]   the five books I read in May, 2024. The first book I read was Science and Human Values by J.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.560]   Bronowski. J. Bronowski, who wrote, I believe he's most known for The Ascent of Man. Anyways,
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:47.920]   20th century philosopher of technology more than anything else, who was one of the well-known
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:56.080]   thinkers and critics on technology and how it impacts society, how it shaped human civilization
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.360]   over the years. So a really respected thinker in that social aspects of technology space.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:08.400]   This is one of his well-known, a shorter book, dense book, Science and Human Values. Interesting,
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.360]   this was really written, I believe this was like mid-20th century. And he's really talking about
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.080]   what was then a very central tension between science and the humanities. And was sort of
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.960]   getting at the value science broad and trying to address some of these concerns of thinking of
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.920]   these two things as being either very separate or one being able to replace the other. So some
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.080]   of it's very of the times, but also there's some really deep ideas in there. So it's interesting
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:46.400]   book. Then I read The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. The Hot Zone, this was a nonfiction book,
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:55.040]   huge bestseller written by Richard Preston about a strain, an airborne strain of Ebola that got
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:02.000]   loose in a primate holding facility in suburban Virginia, Reston, Virginia. So not far from where
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.520]   we are right now. Classic example of narrative nonfiction. Preston wrote this first for The
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.360]   New Yorker and then developed it into a full book. Classic example of narrative nonfiction.
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:22.320]   So it goes back and forth between the history of Ebola, the first times it emerged and just
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:28.160]   destroyed people with the narrative of what was happening in Reston, Virginia. It's kind of a
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:34.080]   cool book. So basically what makes it scary is it was spreading through the air. It was a very,
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:41.920]   very dangerous virus. Makes COVID seem like a skin to me. We're talking at least where they
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:46.320]   were measuring in Africa, like 70, 90% fatality rate, and it was spreading through the air.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:53.360]   Fortunately, and this is not a spoiler because most of the Eastern seaboard didn't die of Ebola
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.640]   in the 1990s. So you kind of know the ending. It wasn't really well adapted for humans.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.080]   But anyways, it gets through. It's a cool book. And it gets through the characters,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   classic narrative nonfiction writing. Richard Preston's great. Used to live actually until
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.840]   recently near where I grew up in New Jersey at this cool big farm that he owned in Hopewell,
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:16.560]   New Jersey had some cool land, but he moved up the main more recently. All right. Anyways,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.840]   great book. If you haven't read it, classic example of narrative nonfiction.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:27.840]   Then I read, because I was on a Preston, I guess I was on a Preston streak, Richard's brother,
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   Douglas Preston. I read his new novel extinction. We went for like a long weekend to sort of like
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.400]   an off season beach resort and I wanted like a summary fun book. And so I read this book extinction.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.840]   I don't know. I don't want to spoil too much of it. Like, okay, I'm not going to spoil it.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:57.120]   It's kind of high concept. There's this sort of ice age Jurassic park, right? So they've de-extincted
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:03.280]   not dinosaurs for 65 million years ago, but sort of ice age animals from 30,000 years ago,
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.400]   like woolly mammoths, right? These types of animals. And there's this sort of isolated park
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:14.800]   in Colorado and this sort of valley that's hard to get in and out of where they've de-extincted
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:22.240]   these animals, grizzly murders start happening. And it soon unfolds a sort of like shocking
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.760]   reality that they were doing more than just de-extincting animals, you know, harmless animals,
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:33.600]   stuff ensues. Kind of a cool book. It's kind of dark at the end too. It was, it was fun.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:39.520]   So Douglas Preston, Douglas Preston is an interesting guy. Interesting guy. Also writes
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.880]   for the New Yorker, like his brother, Richard, occasionally also writes thriller novels. It's
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.760]   like the main thing he does most of them with his coauthor, Lincoln Child, but also solo novel,
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.600]   novels like extinction does also write some nonfiction. He's done a bunch of adventuring,
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:01.120]   like the lost city of the monkey gods. He almost died, like getting these parasite infections,
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.240]   going to explore this lost city in the Amazon. Really interesting guy. Douglas Preston story
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:13.440]   that's interesting to me is that he got a job out of school with the national history museum.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.160]   Is that what it's called? The big one in New York, the big like block, big national,
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.120]   like where they have the dinosaurs and stuff like that. I don't know if it's called American
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.360]   museum of natural history. I'll look it up. Yeah. American museum of natural history,
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.160]   which is like this huge complex funded in the 19th century. It's like a full,
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.760]   like multiple city blocks or whatever. And he was working there
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.200]   and he wrote a book called dinosaurs in the attic. It was the American museum of national
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.600]   history. He wrote this book about a nonfiction book about, this is this, this cool, weird place
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.120]   where, you know, there's all this stuff from 200 years ago, stored in nooks and crannies.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.840]   And he was writing this book, I think for, I don't know who he's writing for,
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.120]   maybe Simon and Schuster, maybe it's for St. Martin's anyways, his editor,
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.880]   Lincoln child, like came with him to see the museum and said, you know what? We should write
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.520]   a thriller that takes place in this museum. It's like such a crazy, cool setting. So him and his
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:17.040]   editor for his nonfiction book wrote the relic, which is like this fantastic thriller about a
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.640]   sort of monster loose in the American museum of natural history. And they became a writing duo
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.080]   and started writing all of these thrillers together, just Lincoln child thrillers.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.920]   And then both Lincoln and Douglas write their own books at the same time. And anyways, I think he's
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.680]   a cool guy. He lived a cool life. Extinction was kind of a cool book. It was interesting.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:40.720]   All right. Then I read when the shooting stops dot, dot, dot the cutting begins.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:49.040]   So I am a, as you know, a sucker for these books about specific people in the movie industry where
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.640]   they talk about their career and all the movies they worked on. This is yet another book written
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.120]   by an editor. This is the second book I think I've read this year about a film editor. And this is
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:07.280]   Ralph Rosenblum had a real distinguished career, did some really famous stuff with Cindy Lumet,
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.000]   and then did a bunch of Woody Allen stuff, including Annie hall. And so this is really
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.040]   interesting. He's a older generation. I mean, you know, he was really working in like the sixties,
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.680]   he was working in the seventies. And again, it's cool to learn about the art of editing.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.040]   It's interesting to hear these stories, his story on Annie hall in particular is really
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.240]   interesting because that movie was filmed to be something completely different.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:36.880]   The original name of Annie hall was a hedonia and it was all of these different,
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.400]   it was supposed to be sort of inside the mind of the Woody Allen character and just showing all
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.520]   these different aspects of his life and all the different stuff going through his mind.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:51.440]   And it was supposed to be like this sort of psychological realism. The Annie hall relationship
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:57.280]   was like one of multiple plot lines that was going to, this movie was weaving together to
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.520]   show the complex psychological life of this, this main character. And in the editing,
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.320]   they rebuilt it to be about Woody Allen's relationship with Diane Keaton. And at one
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.240]   best picture. So that was probably the coolest story in the book to hear about that. So if you
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.640]   love the sort of, if you're a movie cinephile type, this was a great one. All right. Final
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:23.920]   book I read in May, 2024, the great partnership by Jonathan Sachs. I referenced this in a recent
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.000]   episode. Um, you know, I really liked Jonathan Sachs writing. This is about the values of
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.800]   science and the values of religion. And it, it takes a sort of historical theological look at it.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.760]   And there's this big distinction between what he calls the values of Athens and the values
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:46.240]   of Jerusalem. It's like two completely different ways of like processing the world and thinking
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.160]   about things. And he basically makes the argument that they're very complimentary and you need both.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:57.920]   Right. Uh, he thinks this is interesting points in it. Right. Keep in mind, this book was written
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.800]   in the first decade of the 2000. So this was a, or maybe like 2012, but it was a response to the,
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.600]   the new atheist, right? It was a response to Dawkins and Hitchens, et cetera, who, uh,
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:16.800]   were, he sets them up as trying to, um, have the mindset of Jerusalem take over the mindset of
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.680]   Athens. Like there was, they're like at odds and the new atheists were saying that the Athens mindset,
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:25.040]   the sort of left brain scientific mindset, that's what works. And this other thing is
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:29.680]   mythological and fiction and doesn't work. And in the book, he's trying to show like,
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.240]   they got that wrong. These are like two separate ways of seeing the world.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:39.280]   But he argues the reason why we mix this up is because starting with Pauline Christianity going
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:45.200]   forward, you had these Greek ideals, the sort of Athens left brain way of thinking was increasingly
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:50.080]   actually integrated into theological thinking. And for a while, Christianity tried to, to combine
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.680]   these two and that didn't work well. And that's what made them seem like they were somehow
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.040]   intention. Anyways, it's classic sacks where he somehow takes really complicated topics,
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.000]   like the history of Western philosophy, the development of the Abrahamic faiths,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.480]   and he can just talk clearly and simply about them. Like, Oh, I get it that they're there.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:14.320]   These mixed together real skill to do that type of intellectual, uh, intellectual survey
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.760]   with narrative momentum in a way that's very accessible to a non-specialist audience. He was
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.360]   the best at it. So I actually learned a lot. And again, I use this sort of Athens, Jerusalem
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:29.840]   analogy in a deep dive a few weeks ago. So I already got some value out of it. Um, so I enjoyed
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.760]   that book real quick note in the show notes. We have Bram's notion directory link of all the books
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:41.040]   that you've read. Oh yeah. Speaking of notion, our sponsor. Okay. So, so Bram is the name of
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:45.680]   the listener, right? Yep. All right. So a listener is created, uh, uh, he's keeping track of all
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:52.080]   these books from the books I read segment, and he's using notion to build up this sort of flexible
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:55.680]   data-driven view of what I've read. So, oh, right. So links in the show notes. Yep. It's in all the
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.080]   show notes. Perfect. All right. So you can always find that link in the show notes to keep up with
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.240]   the books I've read through many months past. So Bram, thank you for that. All right, Jesse,
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:10.320]   I think that's all the time we have. Thank you everyone who sent in their questions or case
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.640]   studies or called in with their calls. We'll be back next week with another episode of the show.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:19.840]   And until then, as always stay deep. Hey, so if you like today's discussion of the deep life and
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:26.320]   the danger of grand goals, I think you might also like episode 297 called the deep life hardware,
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.280]   where we give a another way of thinking about cultivating a more intentional life. I think
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.160]   you'll like it. Check it out. So today I want to diagnose one of the major causes of this type of
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.640]   failure to get your ambitious plans off and running. We'll then use this new understanding
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.120]   to try to come up with some systematic advice for overcoming it and having more success,
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.680]   introducing more intention into your life.
