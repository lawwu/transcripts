[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180]   (beeping)
[00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:19.240]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.720]   We had a week off last week, 'cause I was on spring break,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.500]   and so we have a ton of questions built up.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.480]   Today's Portfolio Rescue is sponsored by Bird Dogs.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.020]   Duncan, when I was away in my office,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.160]   I got a new shipment of these bad boys, right?
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   - Nice.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   - Now, I was in Florida for a week,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.740]   and all I wore all week was Bird Dogs,
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.760]   because they're comfortable,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.480]   they have this nice little side pocket,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.700]   they have the liner in here, right?
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.540]   You tried it for the first time.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.900]   I've been wearing these for years,
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.480]   but especially in the summer, they're great,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.780]   because you can wear them for working out,
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180]   you can wear them for walking,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.080]   you can wear them in the water, it's great.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.540]   They really are the sort of short for everything
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.660]   you can do in the summer.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.380]   I have two main things I look for
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.020]   when I'm thinking of fashion.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.180]   One is style, I gotta be a little stylish,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.700]   and the other one is comfort, right?
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.060]   I've gotta be comfortable,
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.780]   and these things are very comfortable.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.780]   You can wear them on a lot of different occasions.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.700]   And if you go to birddogs.com,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.980]   what's our promo code?
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.680]   Promo code Rescue. - Rescue.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.140]   - You get a free Tumblr, right?
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.220]   Coffee, I don't drink coffee,
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.940]   but I know there's people who do.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.020]   Get a free one for promo code Rescue.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.980]   - Yeah, and you weren't lying about the side pocket.
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.020]   It's much more comfortable for your wallet.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.460]   - Right, yes, and it's not gonna fall out,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.900]   and if you're not sitting on it,
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.860]   yeah, that can lead to problems down the line.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.940]   You get into middle age, right?
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.780]   That's tough.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.300]   - Yeah, yeah. - All right.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.260]   One of the features we've been talking about a lot
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.480]   on Portfolio Rescue is iBonds.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.940]   Got a ton of questions on these.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.100]   The rate topped out at 9.6%.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.140]   The new rate comes every six months.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.980]   The next one down, inflation came in a little bit,
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.360]   it was down to 6.9%.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.680]   Now today, Bloomberg tells us 3.8%.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.940]   So we had this huge rush into iBonds.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.660]   Maybe it could go back up if inflation rises again,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.460]   but it seems like the really great returns on iBonds
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.020]   and the great yields is, that time has passed.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.860]   It's over.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.660]   - Yeah, yeah, I went ahead and redeemed.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.220]   I told you it felt like a Winnie the Pooh meme thing.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.560]   It seems like it should just say withdraw,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.700]   but instead of withdrawing your money, it's redeeming.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.400]   So I went ahead and redeemed mine.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.820]   Not just because I'm a great market timer
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.660]   and that kind of thing,
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.600]   but also because we just moved into a new place,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.580]   and so there was a lot of cash needed for deposits
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.660]   and that kind of thing.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.620]   - So using the Treasury Direct website was fine?
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.460]   It wasn't a problem?
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.220]   - It actually, yeah, it was like a couple of clicks,
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.820]   and yeah, in like two or three days,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.740]   I saw the redemptions hitting my account.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.220]   - I have a feeling now that rates are lower,
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.660]   we're not gonna hear anything else about these
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.620]   for a long, long time.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.260]   - Yeah, I feel like they're probably gonna lose
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.620]   a lot of their shine now.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.140]   - All right, let's do a question.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.060]   - All right.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.200]   Up first today, we have, hey, lads.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.940]   - This has gotta be from someone either--
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.460]   - It's a lad rush.
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.180]   - This has gotta be someone from Australia or England, right?
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.660]   - Yeah, it makes me feel cool.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.540]   - I can't pull off lads.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.380]   - No.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.620]   Hey, lads, I'm a huge fan of the pod
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.820]   and one of the knife catchers who purchased a house in Q1.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.460]   As someone with a 6 1/8% mortgage
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.060]   from a recent home purchase,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940]   I'm weighing my allocation to stocks
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.940]   versus early mortgage payoff.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.700]   I have a long time horizon as someone in my mid-20s
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.500]   and a needlessly large savings account, not to brag,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.260]   I've been waiting to deploy.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.940]   Do I look at early mortgage payments
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340]   like a 6% or so tax-free bond
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.700]   or should I ignore the idea
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.140]   and just buy equity indices as usual?
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.900]   Their background is $200,000 income,
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.860]   which they say is about $47,000 in New York dollars,
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.540]   very high risk tolerance, they own another home,
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380]   and five-figure 401(k) in their mid-20s.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.220]   Wow.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.940]   - Very, yeah, this is a not to brag
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460]   and also a very nicely,
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.460]   they got a lot of inside jokes here.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.780]   From a hurdle rate perspective, yes,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.460]   early mortgage payments these days
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.100]   can compete with bonds again, right?
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.780]   If you're talking 6 1/8, they're using fractions
[00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.940]   because that's what Michael likes to do.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.140]   I'm a decimal point guy.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.900]   You know, U.S. Treasury yields as of this week
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.460]   are in the 3 1/2 to 5% range, depending on the maturity,
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.340]   so you probably get a little higher yields
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.260]   than the corporate bonds or junk bonds maybe,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.460]   but six and change is a pretty high hurdle rate now.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.520]   So, but I'm not a huge, that's on a rate thing,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.480]   but I'm not a huge fan
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.900]   of comparing early mortgage rates to bonds.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.740]   Here's why.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.940]   Bonds are a financial asset.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.020]   They have liquidity.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.160]   If you own a bond ETF, you can trade it pretty easily.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.540]   It's very liquid.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.740]   It costs you pennies on the dollar.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.220]   I guess you can use bonds to rebalance your portfolio.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.500]   You can use them for spending purposes.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   You can't spend your house.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.860]   So yes, you can borrow against it, I guess, in a pinch,
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.140]   but there's not nearly as much liquidity
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.100]   from early mortgage payments
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.220]   as there is from bonds or a bond fund.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.060]   I guess you could look at paying down your mortgage
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.840]   as a form of personal balance sheet rebalancing,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.340]   but I just don't see it.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.340]   I mentioned this before, I think,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.660]   but we lived in our first house for 10 years
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.500]   and I made extra payments.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Every time we refinanced,
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.220]   I just kept paying the same exact amount as I paid before.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.720]   By the end, I was making double payments.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.340]   And after 10 years in the house,
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.020]   we moved on because we needed a bigger place
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.300]   'cause we had twins.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.020]   And I looked at that, those early payments,
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.860]   and I thought, what good were those?
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.240]   I guess it helped me make a little bit
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.700]   of a bigger down payment on the new place
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.520]   'cause they had some equity,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.540]   but it felt kind of useless in my 20s and early 30s
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.100]   to be making those extra payments.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.660]   So obviously we've talked about
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.620]   the personal preference angle here on many occasions.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.500]   Some people simply hate debt with a passion,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.580]   just wanna get rid of it, no matter the opportunity cost.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.740]   And that opportunity cost equation is different now.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.260]   It's a lot different at 6% mortgage rates
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.220]   than 3% mortgage rates.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.520]   I do think you need to consider
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.340]   the impact of inflation over time, too,
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.220]   when it comes to holding an asset like this, right?
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.700]   If you can get comfortable holding a mortgage
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.160]   and you're not so averse to debt,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.080]   which is something that took some time for me,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.920]   it can work in your favor.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.860]   So this person talked about being in Brooklyn,
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.940]   and so I guess they're not,
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.340]   unless maybe they're from England.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.460]   If they have an accent, they can say it loud.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.780]   I don't know, otherwise I just can't do it.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.900]   - Yeah, I don't think you can just be
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.700]   walking around Brooklyn saying lads.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.820]   - Duncan, you moved out of Brooklyn recently,
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.500]   and I looked up the median home sale, just Google,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.180]   and they had it pegged at like
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.860]   anywhere in the 7.30 to 7.50 range, right?
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.340]   So New York is kind of an expensive place to live,
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.060]   you know, newsflash.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.460]   So let's say you put 10% down in a 7.50 place,
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.740]   30-year fixed rate mortgage at six and change,
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.580]   like this person has.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.300]   We're talking payments around $4,100 a month, right?
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.440]   And that's before taxes, which is kind of tough.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.540]   I don't want to rub it in here,
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.220]   but that same 7.50K price tag at 3% rates
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.900]   would be a monthly payment of $2,800.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   So $1,300 more just because rates are higher, which is tough.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.500]   - Also keeping in mind that average Manhattan rent now
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.060]   I think is $4,500 a month.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.660]   - Yeah, that's tough.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.040]   So people always say location is everything in housing,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.940]   but I think in this cycle it's more about timing and luck
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.900]   than anything else in rates, obviously.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.180]   Hopefully those people locked in the 6% mortgage rates
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.940]   or 7% will be able to refinance in the coming years.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.780]   And I think they will,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.760]   but maybe next time we have a mom, we can ask Bill
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.420]   if the government would consider raising
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.660]   the mortgage interest rate deduction
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.580]   for people who have six and 7% mortgage rates,
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.740]   because that's ridiculous.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.980]   So let's say inflation averages 3%
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.060]   over the life of that loan, right?
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.100]   Which is the average inflation rate, give or take,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.500]   over the last a hundred years or so.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.980]   On an inflation adjusted basis,
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.700]   that $4,100 payment will be worth the equivalent
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.300]   of roughly $1,650 in 30 years time, right?
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   Just using that 3% inflation to eat it up.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.180]   Add in some tax benefits from the mortgage interest deduction
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.780]   and that's even more savings over time, right?
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.180]   I'm not saying that holding mortgage debt
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.020]   is always the right thing to do,
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.600]   but I think for someone in their 20s,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.940]   unless you have a real aversion to debt,
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.260]   having that payment locked in
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.720]   and having the ability to have it as,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.800]   not only housing as an inflation hedge,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.360]   but having that fixed rate mortgage
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.220]   and knowing what the payment's gonna be,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.040]   and having the ability to refinance over time,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.500]   I just think that in your 20s,
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.380]   the benefits of compounding in the stock market
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.900]   far outweigh the benefits of paying down your mortgage.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.740]   That's where I stand.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.960]   Not everyone agrees with me, that's personal preference.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.620]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that makes sense to me.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.100]   I think for a lot of people,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.900]   they just have an aversion to having any debt,
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.420]   even in a case like that, where it seems to make sense.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.300]   Also, keeping in mind,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.680]   I realize a lot of people don't know this.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.080]   In New York City, to rent a place,
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.940]   you have to, the standard is,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.940]   you have to make 40 times your monthly rent in salary
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.340]   to be able to be qualified.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.940]   Most landlords won't let you move into a place
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.100]   unless you make 40 times monthly rent.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.200]   So for that $4,500 average rent,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.440]   that's what, $180,000 a year that you have to make?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.400]   And if you need a guarantor, it goes up to 80 times.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   If you have a guarantor,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.960]   they have to make 80 times your monthly rent in annual salary.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.860]   Isn't that insane?
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.140]   - Yeah, but the benefit is,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.500]   you get to live in a place that's 300 square feet.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.140]   So-- - It's true.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.940]   It's true. - I mean, all right.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.460]   Let's do another one.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.600]   - Okay, up next, we have a question from Sam.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.820]   I have a question about what to do
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.500]   in a very specific black swan event,
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.940]   or in the event of this situation.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.260]   And they think that this is gonna happen.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.740]   It's just a question of when.
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.320]   Let's say one day there's breaking news
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.140]   that China is invading Taiwan,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.500]   which probably means our stock market is going to crash.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.840]   How should an investor react to news of the invasion?
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.180]   A, take all their money out of the stock market.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.180]   B, take some of their money out of the stock market.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.100]   C, wait and see what happens.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.000]   Or D, don't do anything and write it out.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.140]   They're saying it like it's a done deal,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.580]   that the market would definitely crash in that case.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.140]   - Yeah, I mean, it certainly seems like
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.500]   China's been circling Taiwan for some time now.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.320]   I'm no geopolitical expert.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.700]   I read a lot of people that are.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.540]   Maybe it is a question of when, not if here.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.500]   But the assumption would be,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.260]   well, the algos would immediately sell off,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.380]   and this would be bad for the stock market.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.220]   But the stock market has a very counterintuitive
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.420]   relationship with war and geopolitical conflict
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.260]   over the years.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.020]   There's this wonderful book on the stock market
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.880]   and how it reacted to World War II by Barton Biggs
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.700]   called Wealth, War, and Wisdom.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.700]   And for any market geeks out there,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.220]   market historian geeks, I highly recommend this one.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.700]   I read it in the last couple years.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.780]   I know it's a cliche at this point
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.940]   to be a middle-aged guy who's into studying World War II,
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.060]   but I'm totally there.
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.060]   And to be fair, I got into it in college.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.860]   I was traveling Europe in college,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.500]   and after being in Europe
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.700]   and seeing some of the things there,
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.900]   I read every book I could get my hands on.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.860]   I still think Band of Brothers
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.900]   is my favorite book I've ever read of all time.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.000]   For some reason, that book just resonated with me.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.340]   So Biggs uses the stock market
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.220]   to describe what was happening in the war years.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.660]   I wanna read this one part from the book.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.420]   So he says, "By 1942, a map of the world
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.980]   showed Germany in control of most of Europe
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.840]   with its fierce hegemony and stretching from the North Sea
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.500]   to the very gates of Moscow and Leningrad.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.500]   At the peaks of expansion across Asia,
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.980]   Japan controlled 10% of the land mass of the world
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.340]   and much of its most precious natural resources."
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.220]   Now, his point was 1942, at this point,
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.560]   was like, this was like the worst of the worst.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.780]   It seemed like all the allies were teetering on the edge
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.660]   and Germany and Japan were sort of, it's a done deal.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.940]   And he wanted to describe just how bleak things were.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.200]   And guess when the stock market bottomed?
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.980]   1942, John, show this chart here.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.580]   This is the Dow in 1942.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.660]   Now, after the Great Depression,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.380]   the stock market kind of just went along.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.420]   There was a couple other crashes.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.780]   It didn't really come close.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.260]   And then in 1942, the stock market bottomed
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.080]   and just took off.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.980]   It doubled off the lows from 1942.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.420]   The war didn't end until 1945.
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.860]   And by then, the Dow had almost already doubled.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.020]   I've written a lot about this over the years.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.780]   There's tons of other examples where the stock market
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.020]   didn't really react how you'd think
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.380]   in the face of geopolitical conflict.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.660]   So in the six month following the onset of World War I
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.620]   in 1914, the Dow fell 30%.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.940]   And then they actually had to close the market
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.420]   for like six months because their liquidity
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.700]   just dried up across the globe.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.280]   And then in 1915, it reopened
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.020]   and the Dow had its best year ever.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.860]   The Dow was up, I think, 88% in 1915.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.320]   That's a year that's never been topped.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.340]   So during the war, I think throughout the entirety
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.660]   of World War I, the Dow was up 43%,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.780]   around 9% in total, or annually, I should say.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.820]   Same thing in World War II.
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.640]   I think the Dow rose, let's see,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.580]   the Dow was up 50% throughout World War II
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.060]   from 1939 to 1945, 7% per year.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.780]   So during the two worst wars in modern history,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.140]   US stock market was up a combined 115%
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:00.980]   throughout those wars.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.500]   Now, maybe you can say, well, it was different back then.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.580]   There was wartime spending and this would be different.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.060]   Sure, US troops were sent to Vietnam in March of 1965.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.420]   The Dow was up 10% the rest of that year.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.540]   By 1973, when we pulled the last troops out,
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.700]   the stock market was up 5% per year through Vietnam.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.220]   Cuban Missile Crisis, this is one of my favorite ones.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.580]   13 days in October.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.420]   I think that was a Kevin Costner movie, "13 Days."
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.380]   Does that sound about right?
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.580]   - I actually don't remember who was in it.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.700]   Good movie, though.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.380]   - In that two-week span, the Dow lost 1.2%
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.220]   for the rest of the year.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.580]   It was over the Dow gain 10%.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.820]   This one's kind of crazy.
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.140]   John F. Kennedy was assassinated in the early 1960s.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.740]   The stock market opened up 5% the day
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.820]   after he was assassinated.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.340]   Stocks finished up the next year, up 15%.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.300]   - So wait, what's the rationale for that?
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.500]   What possible reason would the market be up the day
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.940]   after a presidential assassination?
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.300]   - Well, US invaded Iraq March, 2003.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.620]   The stock market was up 2.3% the next day.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.420]   Finished up the year more than 30% from that point.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.220]   That was from the depths of a pretty bad bear market,
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.220]   but still.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.420]   Sure, if China invades Taiwan,
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.180]   it would seem to be bad news for the markets
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.180]   and the global economy,
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.220]   but it's not a foregone conclusion.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.100]   I mean, like, should you have a strategy in place
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.300]   to deal with potential geopolitical crises?
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.380]   My contention is you should have a strategy in place
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.660]   to deal for all sorts of crises, right?
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.900]   Even things we can't think of right now,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.060]   'cause splitting hairs here,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.380]   but calling this a black swan,
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.220]   black swans are things that we don't think
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.420]   are gonna happen, or don't know are gonna happen,
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.580]   or come out of left field.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.420]   If you're already planning-
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.980]   - This is more like a gray swan.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.620]   - Yeah, I'm just simply not sold on the idea
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.780]   that anyone has A, the ability to predict
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.940]   such a conflict occurring,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.780]   B, predict the timing of such a conflict,
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.780]   and C, predict what the market's reaction is gonna be.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.940]   Right, so bad things can and will happen in the markets.
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.620]   Like, you can't get away from that fact
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.780]   that the risk assets is going to happen.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.980]   I've yet to meet a single person
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.900]   who can sidestep this kind of event
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.780]   and then figure out when to get back in
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.140]   because of the market's reaction or whatever,
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.660]   what the response is gonna be.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.540]   So, I think trying to plan ahead for something like this.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.420]   I think you make your portfolio durable enough
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.300]   to handle something like this
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.180]   without trying to plan for it in advance.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.220]   - Yeah, I have kind of a broad question for you.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.500]   Would it be a sign to you
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.660]   that someone probably should not be in the market
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.740]   to begin with if they are considering
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.180]   whether or not they would pull all their money
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.460]   out of the market if some kind of macro event happened?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.700]   - Yeah, that's the point.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:16.620]   - Yeah.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.900]   - I think your asset allocation should take into effect,
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.340]   like, you should own enough stocks
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.220]   that you'd be more than willing to own them
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.860]   in a bull market or a bear market.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.100]   - Right. - If you can't, yeah.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.060]   Because otherwise, you're gonna be hopping out
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.100]   and hopping in and that's a game that just no one can win.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.980]   Even if you're right once,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.460]   you're not gonna be right on a consistent basis.
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.380]   - Right, right.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.980]   Also, remember, you and Michael have talked a lot
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.900]   on "Animal Spirits" about Ukraine
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.500]   and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.660]   People thought that it was gonna lead
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.300]   to all these macro events in Europe
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.860]   that just have not happened.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.460]   - I'm still shocked at how much lower energy prices are
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.380]   than they were after the spike from the war.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.020]   It still doesn't, everyone thought Europe was toast
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.500]   in terms of their economy.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.260]   - Yeah, the reaction is always much different
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.100]   than you probably expect.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.900]   - Yeah, humans are hard. - Absolutely.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.700]   Yeah, so events like this,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.060]   even if you know it's gonna happen.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.820]   - So up next, we have a question from Eric.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.260]   I'm a 30-year-old living in Brooklyn,
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.620]   making $175,000 a year.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.740]   I'm maxing out my 401(k), Roth IRA,
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.140]   and have $45,000 in a brokerage account.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.300]   Being my company's ESOP, my company's stock has become--
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.740]   - Duncan, what's ESOP mean?
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.580]   You know it?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.460]   - Company Stock Option Plan?
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.700]   - Got it, nailed it.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.540]   - Is that it?
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.620]   Okay, yeah.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.780]   My company's stock has become 20% of my brokerage,
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.140]   even after selling a good chunk
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.060]   over the past several years.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.780]   I also have an RSU grant that we'll begin investing
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.620]   this year.
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.780]   RSU, what's that one?
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.600]   I don't remember.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.800]   I've known it at one point.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.060]   - Restricted Stock Unit, I guess.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.980]   Yeah, it's a restricted stock, basically.
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.420]   - It's considered a stable dividend growth stock,
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.980]   which I have a question about that phrase,
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.240]   but not one that I have extremely high conviction
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.200]   for long-term.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.900]   My plan is to sell significant portions
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.780]   to tax-loss harvest over the next two years
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.660]   and reallocate those funds to broad-market ETFs.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.580]   When I view my portfolio collectively,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.780]   I feel like I'm well-diversified,
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.660]   with broad ETFs making up about 80% of my holdings.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.420]   But when I view my brokerage in isolation,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.080]   over 50% is allocated to individual stocks.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.420]   Should I be viewing these buckets,
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.420]   retirement and brokerage, as separate,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.980]   given the relative time horizons,
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.940]   or collectively as my overall asset allocation,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.240]   or as a mix of both?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.440]   - Good question.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.840]   Touches on a lot of Ben topics here,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.720]   asset allocation and behavioral finance,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.540]   and all of these things.
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.380]   The simple answer is yes.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.840]   You wanna view your portfolio
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.000]   from the perspective of an overall portfolio.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.160]   Like, the parts should be moving differently
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.180]   at different times.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.840]   The whole point of putting an asset allocation together
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.680]   in the first place
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.480]   is that you'll have different pieces of the portfolio
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.880]   performing differently at different times
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.800]   during different market and economic environments, right?
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.480]   One of the biggest benefits of diversification
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.300]   is that it allows you to prepare
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.380]   for a wide range of outcomes
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.680]   without having to predict those outcomes in advance.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.240]   So I think to do this successfully,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.080]   you have to size your allocations such
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.440]   that certain asset classes or strategies,
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.140]   you'll be willing and able to stick with them
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.100]   even at their worst times.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.000]   So this is like a summarizing a Cliff Asness statement,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.840]   but he says that like the greatest investment strategy
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.680]   in the world is pointless
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.200]   if you put too much of your portfolio in it
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.360]   and bail out the first sign of trouble.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.660]   So I do, however, believe that there are some benefits
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.800]   to a potential bucketing approach, right?
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.000]   So the behavioral bias Eric is explaining here
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.320]   is called mental accounting.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.800]   It's just the idea that we have a tendency
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.760]   to mentally sort our money into separate buckets
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.880]   when it comes to spending or saving.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   So my favorite example of this,
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.200]   I think this was from a DVD extra
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.320]   or an interview for some movie they were in together,
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.400]   Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman talking about
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.640]   back in the day when they lived together,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.040]   a struggling actors and didn't have a lot of money.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.480]   So John, cue this one up for me.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.760]   I love this clip here.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.640]   I go over to Dusty's little apartment in Pasadena one time
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.920]   and he says, "Hey, can you loan me some money?"
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.760]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.920]   My wife was working.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.720]   I wasn't working, but my wife was working.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.440]   So I said, "How much do you need?"
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.120]   He said, "I don't know, five bucks or whatever."
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.960]   - More than that.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.560]   - So I go into his kitchen
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.680]   and he has these Mason jars up on a ledge.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.880]   And one of them says rent.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.320]   One of them says entertainment.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.240]   One says books.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.040]   One says, about five of them.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.320]   - Full on electric.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.400]   - And they all had money in it
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.800]   except the one that said food.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.040]   And that didn't happen to have any money.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.560]   So I said, "Dude, you don't need any money.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.400]   You got money."
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.600]   He says, "I can't take the money out of the other jars."
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.680]   - I love it.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.760]   It is crazy that these two legendary actors
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.640]   live together, right?
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.800]   Especially when Hackman was married.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.920]   - It is, yeah.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.720]   - I actually think there are some benefits
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.040]   when you're thinking of budgeting
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.000]   to separating and giving each of your dollars.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   It's one pile of money,
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.300]   but giving each of your dollars a job.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.140]   This one is for rent.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:33.960]   This is for saving.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.800]   This is for food, whatever.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.260]   This is for utilities.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.040]   My savings account is one big pool of money
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.880]   in the same account,
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.500]   but I have different goals labeled in that account, right?
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.400]   There's a travel one.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.000]   There's a general savings.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.720]   That's just kind of for unexpected events.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.860]   There could be other things that come up
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.000]   like big events for the kids coming up
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.880]   or holidays or whatever it is, wedding trips.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   So I also think that there's benefits of bucketing
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.400]   in things like retirement.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.120]   We've talked before about something like the four-year rule
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.000]   where you take your relatively safe assets,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.380]   whether that's cash or highly liquid securities,
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.300]   and you put them in a certain percentage
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.140]   and you figure out,
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.960]   let's say I'm gonna spend 4% of my portfolio.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.420]   If you have 40% of your assets
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.040]   in something that's relatively safe,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.480]   you can think, well, that's 10 years worth
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.800]   of current spending needs
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.400]   in something that's relatively safe
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.360]   that I could get access to pretty quickly.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.320]   And I think that can help retirees figure out
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.160]   the balance between risk assets
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.740]   and then other assets that are relatively safe
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.580]   in the short term.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.400]   So I do think this specific scenario
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.580]   that we're talking about here for Eric
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.220]   with his company stock options,
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.940]   you have to look at this from a portfolio perspective.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.560]   I don't think you can just look at your brokerage account.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.600]   So if those shares were 50% of your entire portfolio,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.840]   that's way over-concentrated.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.400]   I'd be really nervous.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.980]   20% might be high in individual shares for certain people,
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.320]   but I think this guy still has a right idea
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.540]   in terms of he's already trying to sell.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.120]   And I don't know how great of a thing it is
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   that he doesn't really have a lot of faith
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.260]   in his company's stock.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.600]   He said it's a stable dividend.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.480]   So I'm guessing that means it's more of a--
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.400]   - Well, I was gonna ask you, what do you think it is?
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.760]   What's a stable dividend growth stock?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.500]   - Okay, like a Procter & Gamble
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.080]   or one of these consumer staples.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.920]   So I guess it's not a great--
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.440]   - You call them a growth stock though?
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.800]   That's what I was thrown off by,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   is the growth and the dividend.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   - I guess I'm thinking growth
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.980]   in terms of the dividend is growing,
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.820]   not the company.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.280]   - Oh, oh, oh, gotcha, gotcha.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.720]   - So it's not a great thing, I guess,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.260]   that you're not feeling great
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.300]   about the prospects of your company's stock.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.980]   Maybe that could be just because it's in the midst
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.040]   of a drawdown.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.500]   But yeah, the fact that he already has a plan
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.740]   to diversify it, that's great.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.100]   I still think 20% or so might be high for some people,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.140]   but I think 80% of your portfolio
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.540]   are pretty diversified in index ETFs, that sort of thing.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.180]   But I do think that the overall portfolio
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.180]   is the only thing that matters
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.300]   when it comes to managing risk
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.980]   or setting expected returns, all that stuff.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.540]   I would only use the bucketing approach
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.600]   when it helps you from a psychological perspective,
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.140]   but it seems like in this case,
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.540]   it's probably gonna hurt you.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.660]   But if you still feel like you're more concentrated
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.440]   than you need to be, then stick with your plan
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.860]   of getting rid of some of the individual shares
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.700]   and diversify more.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.620]   But it sounds like he's on the right path here.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.420]   - Yeah, yeah, they seem to, yeah.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.260]   Again, probably isn't a great feeling
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.340]   working for a company where you're like,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.040]   "I feel like I have too much stock
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.180]   "in the company I work for."
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.660]   But I know that's also a common financial planning thing,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.660]   right, you don't wanna have all your eggs in one basket.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.100]   - And that is a question we get from a lot of people,
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.640]   "Hey, I have 20, 30, 40% in my company's shares.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.460]   "How should I feel about this?
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.340]   "How do I diversify it?
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.380]   "How do I deal with taxes?"
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.820]   It's a question, it's like,
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.660]   for a lot of people to think,
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.800]   well, that's a good problem to deal with,
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.400]   but it's a problem nonetheless,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.340]   because the company that's paying your salary
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.280]   is the same one that you're dealing with for retirement.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.820]   You don't wanna have a situation
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.300]   where Enron goes out of business
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.380]   and your retirement is gone just like your paycheck.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.540]   - Right.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.660]   Dave in the chat just said it could be Apple.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.100]   I didn't think about that.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.020]   - That's a stable dividend growth stock.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.780]   - I'd feel okay about Apple.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.740]   - Yeah.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.180]   All right, so up next we have a question from Guy.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.480]   "Nicely done on your debunking of random stats
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.340]   "that make the news and scare everyone.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.860]   "I would like to see you do an overview
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.860]   "on using trust in estate planning.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.120]   "Can one save on taxes using trust?
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   "Where does one even begin
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.760]   "when thinking about this decision?"
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   - Good one, okay.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.580]   I can't do a lot of debunking here,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.820]   'cause I don't have a lot of expertise in trust,
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.180]   but we do have someone with more experience using them.
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.740]   So let's bring in Taylor Hollis,
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.700]   who's an advisor with us at Riddles Wealth.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.540]   - Hi. - Taylor, welcome back
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.420]   to the show.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.100]   You've worked with trust a lot over the years.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.820]   I wish I had the ability to explain these things simply,
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.980]   but it is a question that's come up,
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.380]   and we've had a lot of specific questions,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.880]   but I like the idea that this one is just saying,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.460]   what are they for?
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.540]   Who should think about them?
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.620]   What are the situations?
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.140]   Maybe you could help simplify this for us here.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.740]   - Yeah, I liked his question, too,
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.540]   about specific tax benefits,
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.540]   because I think that has been thrown around a lot
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.820]   when it comes to trust.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.420]   I'll just say off the bat,
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.020]   if you're thinking saving on income taxes,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.460]   trusts typically don't really help you out
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.020]   very much with that.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.900]   They're more for potentially saving
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.380]   on estate and gift taxes.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.540]   So those savings come for people
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.700]   that have taxable estates,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.820]   and those kinds of concerns.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.660]   Now, typically, the most common trusts that we see
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.500]   are what's called a revocable trust,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.540]   which is what people set up while they're alive.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.780]   Revocable, meaning they can change it at any point,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.540]   and it's basically a will substitute.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.020]   And the main benefits that we see to that
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.540]   are it affords you some privacy,
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.580]   you can avoid some probate fees
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.140]   when you pass and your estate's settling.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.460]   So those are typically the most common
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.100]   if you want to get into more of those
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.740]   estate and gift tax savings,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.700]   you'd be looking at making some gifts
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.220]   to a revocable trust during your lifetime.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.180]   - Sorry to cut in here.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.380]   So is the idea basically,
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.260]   people with a decent chunk of change
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.100]   that know that it might be kind of tricky
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.300]   when they're giving up the money for their kids
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.140]   or their spouse or whoever,
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.220]   or charities when they pass,
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.780]   and they wanna make sure that everything
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.780]   is buttoned up and ready to go,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.540]   and there's not gonna be a big mess after they pass.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.420]   Is that the idea?
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.500]   - Yes, that's a good way to put it.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.860]   And I think there's room for using trust
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.620]   in estate planning for people that have a lot of assets
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.180]   and maybe people on the lower end,
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.660]   because again, you can use revocable trust
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.540]   really no matter what your asset size is
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.660]   for those same benefits of privacy, avoiding probate,
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.220]   just makes it easier on whoever's settling your estate.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.140]   There's a lot of benefits to doing that.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.260]   But then I think the real power behind them
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.740]   and a lot of that tax savings
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.980]   that I think he's asking about
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.580]   come with when you have a taxable estate
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.540]   and you're using trust and planning for those things,
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.140]   whether it be during your lifetime, which you can do,
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.100]   or once you're gone.
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.260]   - Do you look at it more in terms of
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.700]   how complicated the scenario is
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.540]   or how much money they have?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.380]   In terms of figuring out--
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.380]   - Typically they go hand in hand.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.220]   - Okay, true.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.700]   More money, more, yeah, okay.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.540]   That makes sense.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.380]   - More money, more problems, that's right.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.700]   - I feel like there was a song written about that.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.740]   - Okay, so I guess as you kind of move up the scale
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.460]   and you have seven figures in assets,
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.420]   eight figures as assets,
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.260]   that's when you start thinking,
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.340]   okay, it's worth it for me to talk to an expert
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.660]   on this matter, basically.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.700]   - Sure, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.060]   And I think, too, it's important to remember that
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.180]   while you might not technically qualify
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.340]   as having a taxable estate today,
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.420]   you take into account future growth of assets.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.020]   It could be that hopefully by the time
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.140]   that you or your spouse passes away,
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.540]   you might have a taxable estate,
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.980]   and so there's a lot of planning that you can do
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.980]   ahead of that to try to mitigate that.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.060]   - Perfect, okay.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.900]   Duncan, let's do another one.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.060]   One more.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.380]   - Okay, last but not least,
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.580]   we have a Tennessee-specific question just for you, Taylor.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.020]   My wife and I want to buy a bigger house in a few years.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.460]   I'm a high school teacher and football coach in Tennessee,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.900]   making $60,000, but I just got a new job
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.180]   that will pay $70,000.
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.660]   Congratulations.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.540]   My wife is going to take off work
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.980]   for the next three to four years with our first baby.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.460]   I'm 33 and she's 29,
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.620]   and we have $380,000 saved up for retirement.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.300]   We have about $100,000 in equity in our current townhome
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.420]   and $35,000 in savings.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.260]   It will be tough for us to afford the mortgage payment
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.740]   on a larger home without a significant down payment.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.420]   Is it okay to pause contributing to our Roth IRAs
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.380]   for three to four years as we continue to save
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.900]   for a larger down payment?
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.580]   We usually try to max them out every year,
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.100]   so it feels wrong to stop.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.180]   This is similar to what I was asking you recently, Ben,
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.300]   about whether it made sense to quit contributing
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.860]   to your retirement to save up.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.500]   - It sounds like they're in a very nice place here.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   Taylor is our resident Tennessee expert here,
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   so that can help.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.100]   But it sounds like they're really good savers.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.480]   They're working on increasing their income.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   That's great.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.140]   First child on the way,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.420]   that's going to be more complexity and maybe expenses.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.940]   But I do think there's a psychological thing
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.460]   where if you've been a saver,
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.900]   we've dealt with this with retirees before, right?
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.060]   It's hard to go from decades of savings
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.580]   and then flip the switch and then turn into a spender.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.700]   But I think for some people too,
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.120]   it's the same thing with life goals.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.540]   When life gets in the way and it causes you to save less,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.460]   people feel like they're doing something wrong.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.820]   When in reality, this is what happens in financial planning.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.420]   So Taylor, how do you help clients see through this
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.100]   from a psychological perspective
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.140]   to help to give them the shove, I guess,
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.500]   to say that it's okay to do this
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.620]   as long as you're still saving and planning ahead
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.060]   and sometimes you just have to do this kind of thing
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.500]   and put things on hold.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.700]   - Yeah, yeah, agreed.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.460]   I mean, there's the textbook answer
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.140]   and then there's the real life answer.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.180]   And like you said, real life happens,
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.540]   first kid on the way, you need a bigger house,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.580]   all these things that I think make
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.460]   putting those things on pause very worthwhile.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.220]   It's your quality of life.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.020]   It's where you're gonna raise your family.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.420]   These are all important factors
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.780]   that we can't really quantify
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.100]   the way that we can quantify
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.580]   contributing to Roth every year.
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.500]   So I think giving yourself the peace of mind
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   and the okay to pause is good.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   And also remember, you're not pausing to throw money away.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.180]   You're still technically investing in an asset.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.620]   It's just a little different, right?
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.860]   You're saving for a home that you're gonna buy
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.740]   and that's still an asset on your balance sheet.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.300]   So I think that, like I said,
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.540]   taking into account those personal factors,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.940]   far outweigh whatever the textbook answer would be.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.100]   - That's a great point.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.780]   You're not putting your retirement savings on hold
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.260]   so you can go to Hawaii for a five month vacation.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.380]   You're doing it for a good reason
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.660]   and it's still a financial asset.
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.020]   It's just gonna, like I said,
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.980]   it's gonna shift your personal balance sheet a little bit
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.380]   and now you have a bigger investment in that house.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.820]   But then as, I think one of the best parts
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.140]   about having a fixed payment for your house
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.940]   is if your income grows
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.900]   and most people do see their income grow over time,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.740]   then you grow into that payment a little more
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.140]   and then eventually, now that that payment is fixed,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.060]   you have the ability to save a little more each year
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.060]   as you get used to living in that house
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.460]   and it's gonna feel more affordable over time, hopefully.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.540]   And I think that's the idea here, to your point.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.980]   Yeah, you're still making an investment.
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.540]   It's just in something else.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.500]   - Right, right.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.740]   And at their age, there's plenty of time to catch up.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.420]   I mean, they're already, I think, well ahead of the curve
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.140]   and they've done a great job.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:10.980]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:11.820]   You're in a good place already.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.780]   It's not like they're starting from zero.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.820]   They're in a good place.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.660]   - And they're insuring
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.020]   that they don't have a Brooklyn landlord
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.980]   who's gonna raise their rent 25% year over year.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.820]   - Yep, probably a little cheaper in Tennessee.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.300]   A little more space, more area for the kids.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.940]   - Depends where they are in Tennessee.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.780]   - That's true.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.580]   Nashville is the new Brooklyn, I think.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.060]   We do love our audience.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.220]   Questions, comments, feedback.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.960]   We actually, I think we heard from this person before,
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.940]   I think a year ago, Brett asked us,
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.700]   "Hey, I work in tech.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.660]   "I have a bunch of money saved.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.740]   "I'm never gonna be able to get this opportunity again.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.660]   "I wanna take off for a year and go backpacking in Europe."
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.260]   And I think we said, "If you have your money saved,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.080]   "you're in a good profession to do it."
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.520]   Just got a follow-up from him.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.360]   Said he wanted to follow up
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.060]   and say he completed one year of backpacking
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.020]   and traveling throughout Europe.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:54.620]   Best decision I ever made.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.300]   If anyone has the opportunity to do the same,
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   I highly recommend it.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.780]   I was able to land a job for a new tech startup
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.940]   and start next week very quickly.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.580]   Even able to keep up with a show while traveling.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.420]   Thanks for the update.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.240]   We appreciate it. - Wow, that's awesome.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.120]   - It's funny because anytime you make
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.920]   these types of financial decisions,
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.300]   you're always dealing with the same level
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.340]   of irreducible uncertainty, right?
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.380]   No one ever knows how these things are gonna work out.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.820]   It's typically, especially something like that.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.640]   But it's always nice to hear when someone makes a decision
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.460]   for the right reasons and it works out for them.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.740]   So kudos. - Yeah, great to hear it.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.300]   - We always appreciate the feedback.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.340]   - That's awesome.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.740]   - Thanks, as usual, to everyone in the chat.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.540]   We always appreciate it.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.560]   Someone says I need to get a CFP designation like Taylor,
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.100]   but that's why we have experts that I can bring on the show.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.940]   I don't need one.
