[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.700]   - Welcome to Portfolio Rescue. I am joined today, as always, by Duncan Hill. Duncan,
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.120]   you look like you're using a switchboard at Santa's secret workshop.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.120]   - Yeah.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   - Looking good.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120]   - Basically what I'm doing.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.380]   - We have a show every week where we answer questions from you, the viewer. If you have
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.360]   a question, remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. Duncan, let's do it.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.920]   - Okay. So, first up today, we have a question regarding our recent Tom Lee video. So, for
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.920]   The Compound and Friends. So, if you haven't seen that yet, go and watch it after this,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.520]   obviously. But, so, this question is, "I watched The Compound and Friends where Tom Lee discussed
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.040]   his prediction about demographic effects on the S&P 500's performance. As a Gen X-er who
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.740]   got burned in the GFC, I'm happy to ride the wave with millennials, even if S&P 19,000
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.680]   for 2029 seems ambitious. I also heard on CNBC that millennial millionaires hold 25%
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.560]   of their wealth in crypto. My question is whether the potentially limitless supply of
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.920]   cryptocurrencies might divert millennial investments away from the S&P and impact performance.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920]   While there have always been alternatives to the stock market, they existed in more
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.000]   finite supplies, like real estate, art, gold. Could the supply of cryptocurrency and millennial
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.320]   adoption derail the S&P market wave?"
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.320]   - A lot going on here. I like this one. If I was on a podcast, I would say there's a
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.200]   lot to unpack here. But I'm not, so I'm not gonna say that. All right. I did a little
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.840]   research here. Total financial assets held by individuals, this is excluding real estate,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.320]   excluding liabilities, at the end of 2020 was around $250 trillion. So, crypto right
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.560]   now makes up around $2.2 trillion in market cap. That's all of crypto. So, that's like
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.960]   0.5% of global financial assets. On the one hand, very, very small in the grand scheme
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.680]   of things. On the other hand, it's really only been a financial asset for, I don't know,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.320]   five years, legitimately. And all the money from actual wealth managers is only now coming
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.360]   in. So, obviously, you could make the case that's going to grow in the years ahead.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   Here's the way I'm thinking about this, as a way to be a stopper for the stock market.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.460]   Millennials really won't have much of an impact for a while, for the simple reason that they
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.560]   don't have a ton of assets right now. So, John, let's do a chart on here of wealth by
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.520]   generation. So, this shows baby boomers hold 53% of financial assets right now. This is
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.960]   in the U.S. Gen X holds 26%. Millennials have less than 5% of financial assets. Obviously,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.680]   eventually, a lot of that money from the boomers, if they don't spend it all and go to Vegas
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.320]   and blow everything before their kids get it, a lot of that money will be passed on
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.760]   to the next generation. But it's going to happen at a glacial pace. It's going to take
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.640]   a while. And obviously, you have the fact that millennials are coming up, and they're
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.440]   going to be in their peak earnings years, and they're going to be saving more. So, they
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.720]   could divert some more money to crypto. But it's going to be a while. I would actually
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.780]   be far more worried about other asset classes before I got to worry about the stock market.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.600]   Gold is the easiest one, right? I actually think millennial/Gen Z digital gold is probably
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.280]   the most compelling investment thesis for Bitcoin at the moment. So, gold is $9-10 trillion,
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.400]   depending on how you count it. Is it possible that Bitcoin and all crypto could get there?
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.160]   I think that's, especially for Bitcoin, as the digital gold, I think that makes sense.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.240]   Next we have money markets or savings accounts. How many young people these days love having
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.120]   their money in a bank savings account that earns 10 basis points? Or a money market account
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.160]   at a brick-and-mortar bank? Even if you go to an online bank account, you're talking
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.480]   50 basis points. Let's say interest rates remain low. That's a possibility they could
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.120]   remain low for a long time. If they're not going to rise now, when economic growth is
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.640]   going crazy and inflation is going crazy, I really don't know when they're going to
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.160]   rise. So, could you see things like stablecoins take the place of money markets, or at least
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   for young people? Or savings accounts? Now, obviously, stablecoins will probably need
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.360]   some sort of regulation first. They don't have the FDIC insurance on them. They're paying
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.500]   much higher yields than anywhere else. You can get 8-10% in a stablecoin right now. Obviously,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.900]   if there is some regulation and more people pile in, those rates' yields have to come down.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.200]   But let's say in the future you could get 4-5% in a stablecoin as a savings account
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.320]   vehicle, versus less than 1%, less than 50 basis points in a savings account with a bank.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.460]   I think that's way more compelling to me. How about this? A status symbol for a lot
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.760]   of boomers starting in the '90s, really ramping up in the 2000s, and then the 2010s for sure
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   after the global financial crisis was hedge funds. If you count the number of Wendy's
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.840]   and Chipotle's in the United States right now, there are more hedge funds than those
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.800]   two combined. There's 10,000 hedge funds in the world right now. Will millennials really
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.040]   want to put their money there when they can have maybe something more exciting in crypto,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.920]   especially with the abysmal returns we've seen in hedge funds, especially with the fees
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.780]   they charge? I still think that all those other avenues would probably be disrupted
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.860]   much faster than the stock market assets. And if you look at crypto, it's still five
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.540]   to six times more volatile than stocks. You still can't put crypto in a 401(k). Maybe
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.180]   that's coming eventually. You can't do it now. I suppose you could make the argument,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.420]   "Well, listen, young people have grown up with crypto. They don't care that it's five
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.320]   to six times more volatile. They're used to the 24/7 markets. What's the Bain quote, Duncan?
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   You think darkness is your ally. You merely adopted it. I was born into it. Molded by
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.140]   it. Is that right?" Something like that. So, you could make that case. But I still think
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.700]   that all these other things, crypto has a much better chance of disrupting them than
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.260]   the stock market. And I think crypto and stocks could actually go hand-in-hand in a portfolio.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.900]   That makes more sense to me. Getting back to the unlimited nature of crypto, it is kind
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.220]   of funny that there's this abundance of scarcity. The initial draw to Bitcoin, especially, was
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.020]   scarcity. And now we have a million different coins. And this person is right. You can keep
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.900]   creating coin after coin after coin. But I think, eventually, that's all going to go
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.820]   away. So, the analogy I want to make here is the automobile. The first car manufacturing
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:14.020]   company I think came out in 1895. Cars really ramped up. By the 1900s, from 1900 to 1910,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.580]   you had 250 new automakers came on board as new companies. From 1910 to 1920, you had
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.360]   another 150, 160. Apparently, this is Wikipedia, so take it for what it's worth, but there's
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.820]   been 3,000 car companies founded in the United States since then. 3,000. By 1950, there were
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.700]   three of them, basically. Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors. You had the big three.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.220]   Now, maybe -- and they had that for, I don't know, 10, 20, 30 years by the time Honda and
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.180]   Toyota started really making some headway in the 1970s, 1980s. Now, maybe you have eight
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.820]   to 10 car manufacturers that control the entire market share. I think you're going to see
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.180]   that same dynamic play out in crypto, where, eventually, a lot of these ones that just,
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.740]   for a while, you realize there's no use case for them. There's something better that comes
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.940]   along. A lot of the smaller ones just drop off or go nowhere. I think you're going to
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.880]   have a few use cases where you have these certain protocols that are actually useful
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.920]   when these use cases come about. You'll have a handful of crypto projects that dwarf the
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.500]   other ones by far. Those ones take this unlimited nature of it, and they make it so, why do
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.360]   you need to have so many of them? They can just dwarf them and get rid of them. That's
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.240]   kind of where I come on. I'm not worried about crypto taking headway from the stocks. I think
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.520]   that transformation could take a long, long time, even if millennials start doing it.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.200]   You start at, I don't know, a 5% to 10% allocation for most people that aren't totally crypto
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.040]   evangelists. That's kind of the way I'm looking at it.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.640]   It's kind of funny that you have this divergence of people who are going into stable coins
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.320]   for the yield, but then, traditionally, people have been in crypto to try to get 1,000 X
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.480]   or something. It's kind of interesting to see that playing out.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.720]   Right. It's funny because money markets actually helped bring about Vanguard back in the day.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.680]   That was their big asset. I actually think for adoption, for getting people who aren't
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.000]   in crypto right now, I think that's actually a pretty good use case as stable coins are
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.920]   the money market of crypto. I think that's a good way to get people in.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.560]   Alright, let's do the next one. This is one of our favorite questions we've got in a while.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.920]   This is a fun one. I like this one a lot. This question is from Chris. "Let us know
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.200]   in the chat if you're a Magic the Gathering fan." Chris writes, "I have a massive Magic
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.080]   the Gathering collection and I'm looking to move it into something more liquid. My collection
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.900]   was worth about $600,000, but I sold 170K worth of cards in 2021. I spent a large chunk
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.680]   of that on enjoying life and put the rest into savings and a munibond fund. I'm considering
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.000]   selling another large chunk of my collection in 2022. If I sell, what's the best way for
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.900]   me to put that cash to work?" Then the second part of that is, "Or do you think they should
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.640]   even sell given how the collectibles market is looking right now?"
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   $600,000 worth of Magic the Gathering. Wow. Duncan, what is your experience with Magic
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.280]   the Gathering? Dungeons and Dragons, basically?
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.880]   There's definitely a lot of overlap there. I'm not an expert in Magic by any means. I
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   was more of a Pokemon person. I do have a starter set. I have a starter pack of Magic
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.300]   from when I was in high school that I still have somewhere, so I should probably pull
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:25.060]   that out. Chris also shared this site that allows you to get real-time pricing on Magic
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.900]   cards. There's this entire site dedicated to that. They have a ticker showing prices.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.140]   There's a few things happening in the collectibles market. One was, the pandemic happened and
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.940]   people got bored. The other thing was, though, that the internet has really just made a market
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.660]   for this stuff that didn't exist in the past. You can go look on eBay. You can go look on
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.700]   this site that you found and see what the prices are in real-time, which is kind of
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.100]   cool. I guess the one thing you have to be careful
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.320]   of here is the endowment effect, where you feel like things that you own are worth more
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.420]   simply because you own them, and you want to hold on forever. I think, especially with
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.080]   something tangible like this, it's probably more of an emotional investment than anything,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.820]   because you can see it and feel it. You're probably not picking it up too often, because
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.100]   you don't want to mess it up. It's probably in the packaging still, if it's worth that
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.500]   much. But I think this huge collectibles boom in the market that we've seen since the pandemic,
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.940]   some people say, "Well, this is Beanie Babies, and look what happened then. It crested and
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.580]   it broke." And other people say, "No, we're actually making a market for these things.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.900]   We can fractionalize them and sell shares in them." I don't know. This is kind of like
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.580]   crypto, where there's so much stuff now, and it really depends on who's in the market for
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.900]   this and how much money they want to spend. I guess the bull case here is that there's
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.280]   so much money sloshing around, it doesn't matter. I think if you have a chance to cash
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.540]   out at a much, much higher price on this, and that's going to diversify you more. For
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.140]   this person's portfolio, I think he said he has $1M in retirement accounts and $600K in
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:50.180]   Magic the Gathering cards. So, you have a huge, huge concentrated position in this one
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.980]   collectible that has some liquidity, but it's not as liquid as a financial asset. So, I
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.300]   think if you can diversify, that's just me. Boring old me would rather diversify. And
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.580]   if there's a specific piece that you want to hang on to, that you think, "I think this
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.820]   is going to be worth so much more," or, "It just has special meaning to me," you can hang
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.980]   on to it. As far as what you want to put your money towards, this is why you have a preset
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.660]   asset allocation depending on your time horizon. Then you don't really have to think about
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.500]   this question. If this is money that you know is going to be invested for a certain amount
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.340]   of time, then you have an asset allocation where you say, "My mix between stocks, bonds,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.800]   cash, whatever, real estate, other investments, is going to be like this." And then you invest
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.760]   based on your asset allocation. You don't try to overthink it and think, "Well, should
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.380]   I try to off that, or should I put this in some sort of fund?" Look at your asset allocation
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.820]   and what you have now, and then use that as your guidepost for this.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.820]   I did get one other thing on this. I actually asked a regular on the show, Bill Sweet, who's
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.260]   our tax expert, "How do taxes work on something like this?" Because taxes on collectibles
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.620]   are different. He said that there's actually a maximum rate. It doesn't work like just
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.460]   selling capital gains on a stock. There's a maximum rate of 28% on these, depending
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.540]   on your income level. So, think through the tax implications of selling this as well,
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.980]   which is kind of crazy. It has its own little market, but that's the way things work. Kudos
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.620]   to you for holding this whole time. I'm sure he's seen a massive increase in this, and
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.380]   held it for a long time.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.300]   Wathen: We should also add that Chris mentions that they still play, still love Magic. They
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.140]   still have a collection of cards that they're keeping. These are other cards that they're
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.780]   getting rid of. So, yeah, pretty cool. That's something that you enjoy over the years. I'm
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.420]   guessing probably for a very long time, could actually end up paying off in that regard.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.660]   Lewis: If you do sell, let us know what you get for this stuff. Please don't come back
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.060]   and blame me if it's worth way more than 20 years. But, that's my thought on it. Alright,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.820]   let's do the next one.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:49.160]   Wathen: Up next, we have a question from a young financial advisor. "I'm a new financial
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.700]   advisor at 25 years old, and I'm at an independent financial planning firm in California. I'm
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.140]   on a contract where I have to produce X amount of insurance in three years. I'm finding it
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.020]   difficult to build a client base and get assets under management early on. I've built great
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.940]   relationships with centers of influence and receive referrals somewhat consistently. However,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.020]   the lack of pay from insurance and the non-existent AUM is making me second guess where I am career-wise
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.100]   and financially. Is it worth going to a discount brokerage and getting a salary and incentives,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.060]   or should I look into buying another book of business, or should I just stick it out
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.060]   for a few more years?"
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:29.700]   I should also mention, we covered this question on another show a couple months back, but
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.900]   we wanted to dive a little deeper into this one.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:35.300]   Lewis: Yeah, I want to go a little deeper, because I've never done the eat what you kill
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.460]   kind of thing, but we have some people in our firm. Jonathan Novy, who's our resident
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:44.140]   insurance expert, grew up in the insurance industry, and I'm sure you know a lot about
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.740]   this. I've had friends who've had these jobs, especially right out of school, like this
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.180]   young person, where it's basically like, go through your list of contacts, find your friends
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.540]   and family, sell them insurance. I think my brother-in-law, as a single guy in his 30s,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.140]   was pitched from a friend for life insurance. But I guess that's how it works, and if you
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.420]   don't know how this works, why don't you explain from your perspective how this stuff works
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.100]   in the insurance industry and why this could be potentially difficult for this young financial
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.100]   advisor?
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.420]   Steele: Sure. First, I want to say to him, you're not alone. I mean, hell, Josh wrote
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.420]   a book about the incentives, or how incentives in this business are not necessarily aligned
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:27.060]   for the end user. But first thing to consider with this is, I know it's hard to realize
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.980]   this, but you're not at an independent financial planning firm. You're at a place that requires
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.940]   you to sell insurance. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying just understand what it is
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.580]   that you're doing. And I was at a place like that. I started at an insurance company, broker/dealer,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.460]   back in 2007 when I got in this business, as my colleague Brian Rosen, who's with us
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.460]   now.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.460]   Maxfield And I assume they gave you quotas, probably?
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.140]   Steele So your benefits and your payouts were based
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.980]   on how much of the proprietary crap that you sold, whether it's insurance products or annuity
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:02.180]   products or whatever. So it didn't take us long to realize then that we were at a place
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.500]   where the incentives weren't aligned for the end user. And that's the story of learning
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.620]   how to be in this business for a very, very long time. You're not alone who sent this
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.380]   question in. It used to be a long time ago that if you wanted to get into what was then
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.580]   the brokerage business, you went to some wire house and you got hired because your family
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.300]   had connections and they figured you could sell your dad's friends some stuff. And if
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:33.700]   you stuck around long enough, then you either stayed or you were gone and the "senior advisor"
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.940]   you work with kept the business.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.380]   Maxfield So I guess you have to figure out whether
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.660]   you're going to be in sales or an advisor. But the thing to remember is that everyone
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.020]   is in sales in some aspect.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.500]   Steele Right, right. So it could be that the place
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:50.620]   is a decent place to learn. And he mentions discount brokerages in here. By discount brokerage,
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.380]   I'm assuming you mean things like Fidelity or Vanguard, which have actually not bad planning
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.020]   programs. And we have a colleague who was at Vanguard for a while, and he learned how
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.500]   to become a financial planner. He got his CFP and now he works at RWM and talks to clients.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.980]   So there's definitely a learning curve in this business. It could be that the place
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:15.180]   where you are isn't the worst place. And everything's a trade-off. And if you're at the point where
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.300]   you feel really awful about having to talk to every single person you talk to about buying
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.700]   an insurance product, then you shouldn't be there.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.300]   Maxfield Jonathan, you have my favorite definition
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.720]   of this. So tell me, tell the people again, what is your definition of insurance and kind
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.980]   of thinking through that way too?
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.780]   Steele Got it. So when it comes to insurance, this
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.340]   is the thing you have to realize. People buy insurance because there will be a financial
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.560]   impact on their family, were they to die or be disabled or need long-term care or something
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:46.740]   like that. Our job as advisors is to figure out what that financial impact is. End of
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.460]   story. Measure that impact in dollars. And then if it is the kind of low probability
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:56.500]   high impact event that is a triggering event, then someone's going to insure that for you.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:04.100]   But there is no like people don't need insurance. People have risks that they're trying to manage.
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.020]   Insurance is just a tool that we use to help manage that.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.860]   Maxfield I think a pretty good way of looking at this
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   from the young person's perspective is does your insurance company expect you to sell
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.540]   only insurance to everyone for every single problem they have? If that's the case, then
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.220]   that's probably not the kind of place you want to stick around at because insurance
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.940]   is not always the answer. It can be an answer for certain things, but it's not an answer
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.900]   for every financial problem someone has.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.820]   Stewart Right. Right. And you end up at the kind of
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:36.100]   places and like the worst culprits, the places that are the guiltiest of having the really,
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:42.500]   really bad incentive structures are typically the captive insurance places where they try
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.180]   to convince you that you have some sort of moral obligation to sell insurance to people
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.140]   and that you're always doing something that's in their best interest by selling them an
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.220]   insurance product. It's flat out not true.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.220]   Maxfield Right.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.740]   Stewart And like I said, I started at an insurance
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.820]   company broker-dealer back in the day, and it took us a short amount of time to realize,
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.940]   "Well, it's not perfect if you want to be a fiduciary."
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.380]   Maxfield Yeah. I think the biggest thing is this person's
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.180]   got to realize, "Do you want to be a salesperson that sort of eats what you kill or do you
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.540]   want to actually be a financial advisor?" There's nothing wrong with that. There's
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:17.340]   great people who sell and do fine for themselves. It's just kind of getting your head around
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.340]   that.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.660]   All right, let's do the next one. We had another insurance one for Jonathan.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:32.060]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Steve. "I'm 67 years old and about to retire.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.340]   I live in the Midwest, have no mortgage, and have a relatively low cost of living. I have
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.940]   enough savings to wait until age 70 to take Social Security so I can get the max. I own
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.780]   a Fidelity deferred annuity. My father forced me to invest in this account years ago when
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.740]   he realized I was going to be a ne'er-do-well adventurer," which sounds interesting. "The
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.540]   amount dropped to $299,000 in April 2020 but now stands at $461,000. When I convert it,
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.700]   this annuity will provide the bulk of my retirement income so I live and die on how my money is
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:08.380]   invested at the time of conversion. I'm tempted to leave the allocation as is, 33% to 36%
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.060]   in bonds, 11% in international stocks, and the rest in U.S. stocks. Is there any reason
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.460]   not to annuitize the account as it stands now? Am I missing something?"
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.460]   All right.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.620]   Also, there's some stuff in here for the new boys watching. I feel like you should probably
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.700]   write down what kind of account he's even talking about there.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.500]   Yeah, for sure. And also, right away, Steve didn't have to tell us his age because he
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.460]   said "ne'er-do-well." How do you say it?
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.460]   Ne'er-do-well.
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.460]   That's definitely a boomer phrase, sorry, Steve.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:41.460]   So the idea here, Jonathan, because an annuity is an insurance product, technically, explain
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.580]   to us what this is about the conversion factor. Because even I'm a little shaky on this stuff.
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.020]   So how does this work? Is it in a certain account that changes over time and then you
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.700]   have to lock in a certain allocation and that's it for the rest of your time?
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.780]   Right. So it's not locking in a certain allocation. What he means is, and let's look at annuities
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.340]   in general first, the specific thing that this guy's talking about. When he talks about
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:09.260]   like activating or annuitizing the contract, the cash value itself goes away for his use.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.620]   So annuities, like everything else, are just a product and they allow you to engage in
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:18.000]   a series of trade-offs. In annuitizing or activating the account, what he would get
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.220]   is the insurance company would pay him out a stream of payments or income every month
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.300]   for the rest of his life, no matter what.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.700]   All right. So that lump sum is now effectively gone and it's being replaced by regular income.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.980]   Exactly. So it's akin to having a pension from years ago. I mean, I know not that many
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:41.680]   people have those anymore. The trade-off you engage in when you annuitize this kind of
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.180]   contract or buy something like a SPIA, a single premium median annuity, or a deferred income
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.540]   annuity, there's lots of this stuff swimming around in the world. The trade-off you engage
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:58.500]   in is you give up liquidity to make sure that you don't run out of money. This is flat-out
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:04.680]   longevity insurance and you're making a trade. Were he to annuitize that contract and live
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.700]   to be 106, he is the winner by far.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.860]   But what people don't quite understand is they'll say things like, "And if he's 67 and
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.620]   he annuitizes that now, maybe they're going to pay him 6.5% or something of his account
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:26.100]   balance every year." You're not earning 6.5% on your money. The first many, many years
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.260]   of payments, the insurance company is returning your own money to you.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.820]   Right. Yeah. If he hands over 300K or whatever it is, or 500K, whatever it is, at the beginning,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.900]   that's that money coming back to him because it's the money he already gave them.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.520]   Right. And it's the tax treatment of payments on annuities like this is generally pretty
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.060]   good because you're only taxed on what's known as exclusion ratio because basically it's
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.860]   a return of your own money for a lot of it.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.860]   Right.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:56.380]   But it is a trade-off. Now, the interesting part of this question to me is it allows us
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:02.300]   to kind of figure out the planning challenge of the difference between being rational and
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.660]   reasonable or the difference between optimizing for math and optimizing for people. It's not
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.940]   just the math. The math might say to you, if you invest that money, you could earn more
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.880]   over time and end up with more money at the end of your life. It may say that. But if
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.480]   it's true, and the assumption I'm making in here is that he has extra liquidity beyond
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   what's in the annuity.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.200]   Right. If he has a big purchase come up, he might be out of luck.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   Right.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.880]   But yeah, you're right. The psychological component is he gets this money and it's coming
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.420]   to him every month and he doesn't have to have any sort of other planning. He doesn't
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.640]   have to figure out asset allocation, any of this stuff. It's taken care of him. And that
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.320]   seems appealing to me, especially for someone who may not have a huge retirement balance
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.040]   and have millions of dollars to pull from. It makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.680]   Absolutely. If this is the kind of thing that allows him to do things like invest the balance
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.960]   he has, because effectively what you're doing when you're locking in the stream of income,
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.480]   that's the equivalent of a bond portfolio. It's not liquid, but that's the equivalent.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.420]   So it changes if you're trying to think of an overall household asset allocation. This
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.500]   makes your asset allocation more conservative with the fixed part of what you have. So it
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.180]   allows you to, if you want, invest the liquidity you have.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.480]   And it's also important to remember that he said he's going to wait to take Social Security.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:24.180]   That's basically an annuity as well. So yeah, your point is do you wait? Do you do it now?
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.800]   It depends how quickly you want to lock in whatever your rate is going to be, basically.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.880]   And if he's able to basically accommodate all of his lifestyle expenses with the annuity,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.980]   and then the assumption you make is, based on what he wrote, that when he reaches age
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.720]   70, he'll have more than enough to pay his bills with Social Security and with his annuity.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.080]   That means the liquidity he has is extra. It's bonus money.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.560]   So this is a personal finance question, but yeah, that makes sense to me.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.080]   It's interesting. One more thing to note about annuities. They get a really bad rap in the
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.840]   media, and they deserve that. It's not because the products themselves are bad. It goes to
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.560]   the thing we were talking about in the earlier question. It's all about the incentives that
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.900]   go with selling them. This annuity looks like it's pretty good. It probably doesn't come
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.300]   with a massive sales charge or commission to the person who sold it to him originally.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.560]   Annuities themselves are great. It's the incentive structures that are built into the sale of
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.440]   annuities, which give them a really, really bad rap, which they deserve, for sure.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.040]   Hard to know what you're getting into. I've got one more question for Jonathan before
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.600]   we go. Jonathan, what is the name of the steakhouse in Chicago that you took me to that you go
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.080]   every year for Christmas Eve for your birthday?
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.440]   Oh, we go to Joe's. Joe's Steak and Seafood.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.640]   Because that's your birthday, right?
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.480]   It is my birthday in two days. So, I will be going back there. It's a good one. I'm
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.560]   turning 50 in two days, so I intend to eat and drink for my country.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.300]   Oh, nice. That's a great place. What is it like? It's like they make the most money of
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.800]   any restaurant per square foot of any in the country or something, right?
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.240]   Right. So, prior to COVID, they were allegedly the most profitable per square foot restaurant
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.960]   in the country. I don't know what it's like now. I intend to contribute to that on Friday.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.640]   By the way, I'm looking at the comments here. I saw someone call me Ben J. Powell for my
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:16.540]   love of the Fed. Pretty good burn. Not bad. Remember, if you have a question for us, ask
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:23.000]   thecompoundshow@gmail.com. Leave us some thoughts in the comments below. I'd love to hear people's
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   thoughts on their collectibles. I saw a bunch of people talking about stamps, any other
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.640]   magic, the gathering, Dungeons and Dragons. I have some 90s sports cards that are all
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.700]   probably worthless because there was no scarcity back then. Thanks to Duncan for being nice
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.280]   and festive today. Thanks for Jonathan for his insurance know-how. Remember, idontshop.com
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   for all your needs. We're going to come back in the new year, right, Duncan? 2022, taking
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.920]   next week off. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas, everyone. Thanks for coming along. Thanks,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.440]   everyone. Cheers, guys. See you in 2022.
