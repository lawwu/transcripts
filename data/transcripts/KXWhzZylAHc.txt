[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   Cal, I struggle most with shutting down my day.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.640]   I recently became a software architect,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm still constantly task switching
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.200]   between my old development responsibilities
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.960]   and learning my new architectural role,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.560]   such as keeping up with new projects
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.800]   and technologies inside our organization.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800]   I can usually perform some deep work in the mornings,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   but my afternoons are filled with status calls
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200]   and virtual meetings to solve multiple
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.920]   small technical issues.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.340]   At 4 p.m. I'm drained and finding the energy
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.920]   to clean out my inbox, organize my task list,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.200]   and put a bow on the day, feels like a chore.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   I don't have a problem turning off my work,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.400]   it literally doesn't even pop into my brain
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.040]   when I leave the office.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.840]   Any tips on closing out the day?
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.560]   Could I maybe shut down at lunch
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.080]   and leave the rest of my day for meetings with colleagues?
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.680]   Or do you have any other advice?
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.220]   - Well, that's a good question, it's a common issue,
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.680]   that the afternoons get so busy
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.000]   that when you get to the end of the day,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.800]   you can't face the onslaught of information
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.320]   you have to deal with, it's too exhausting,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080]   it takes up too much time.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.400]   I can have two pieces of advice to give to you.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.460]   Number one is what you suggested in your call
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.040]   I actually think is a good idea.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.160]   I think it's completely fine to have a reckoning
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.480]   with your inbox and your plan that doesn't happen
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.260]   at the very end of the day.
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.960]   Lunchtime is not a bad idea.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.520]   You deep work in the morning, at lunchtime,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   you process through the emails that have been sitting
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600]   in your inbox, you look at your plan for the week
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.440]   and update that, you look at your calendar,
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.760]   you get your arms around everything,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.560]   and then you turn your attention towards the status calls
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.480]   and meetings that take up the afternoon.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.480]   It's a great idea, it's actually gonna give you more energy
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.280]   as you get towards those meetings
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040]   'cause you don't have this open loops looming
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.640]   in the back of your mind while you're trying
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.100]   to pay attention to what someone's telling you.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.440]   The other piece of advice I'm gonna give is,
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.000]   every time you schedule a status call or a meeting,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.560]   schedule for right after it time to process
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.840]   and make sense of what was discussed in that meeting
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.520]   or what was discussed in that status call.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.840]   So you put something in your calendar,
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.120]   you put that right in your calendar right after it,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.180]   15 to 30 minutes,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.880]   depending on how big the meeting or call is.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.920]   This allows you to actually close all of the loops
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.000]   that are opened with each of these back
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.960]   and forth interactions to go through it and say,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.720]   okay, what did I just commit myself to?
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.280]   And where am I gonna put that?
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.460]   And where should I write that down?
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.840]   And do I need to put some more notes on my list
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.280]   that now I have to get back to this person
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   or me put a reminder on the calendar?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.880]   You wanna figure out what do I need to do?
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.520]   Is there some emails I need to send out
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.560]   to get a process started?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.100]   Do it there, make that part of your meeting.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.200]   When we separate the two, this also leads to overwhelm
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   because what happens then is if you have four status calls
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.920]   and meetings scheduled in the afternoon,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.840]   you end up with four status calls and meetings worth
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   of open loops and things that have to happen
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.040]   and deadline reminders all mixed together in your head
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   and now it's 4.30.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   You're like, I can't even disentangle all of this.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.920]   The thought of it is giving me anxiety sweats, right?
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.840]   It's built up to be too much
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.480]   and forget all the other emails unrelated
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.680]   that have been building up, it's too much.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.400]   But if after every meeting you say,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.980]   I'm now gonna spend time working on it,
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.480]   that a meeting is a two part affair.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120]   There's the part where there's other people involved
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.240]   and there's a part where I deal with it,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.120]   that all gets handled and you get closure
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.200]   and you take a breath, then it's the next one.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.360]   And then when you get to the end of the day,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000]   there's a lot less to deal with.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.680]   You've dealt with the stuff that those things generated
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.420]   and all that's left now is maybe emails that have arrived
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.760]   unrelated to your meetings during the day.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.440]   And if you wanna handle those the next day at lunchtime
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.980]   or what have you, I think that's fine.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.200]   So do those two things, do your official shutdown earlier
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.120]   and schedule a processing period,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.920]   piggybacking with every single other thing
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.320]   that goes onto your calendar.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.720]   And I think you're gonna find the shutdown
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   is gonna be painless and you're gonna come into it
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.700]   with much more mental clarity.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   All right, that's feeling.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.740]   (upbeat music)
