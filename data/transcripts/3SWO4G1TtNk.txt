[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   It's Friday and we are back with Tripp Lee.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.500]   And yesterday in episode 596, we talked about self-denial and the goodness of God.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   We need to make this practical.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.000]   And Tripp, as you know, on-screen explicit sexuality is simply ingrained into pop culture today.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500]   And I'm thinking especially of popular television series like Game of Thrones.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.000]   But this is also true of movies.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500]   Not even to mention the accessibility of explicit pornography online.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.000]   So, what would you say to Christians who are willing to watch on-screen nudity in an attempt to be culturally relevant?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Well, it's so hard right now because just kind of this explicit sexuality and nudity is everywhere.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.500]   You know, just small example, I was just in a store in my neighborhood yesterday and standing in line.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000]   And there are just porn magazines just out behind me, not even covered up.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.500]   You know, you don't even have to try right now to see ridiculously sexually explicit things.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   It really is everywhere.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   There are shows I started to watch and me and my wife started to watch and we loved.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.500]   And there was one that just the writing was brilliant and, you know, all the little strange things we like about TV shows were in it.
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500]   But we had to stop because of just the kind of explicit sex.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500]   And it seemed to be glorifying adultery.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   And there were just reasons that we felt like we had to stop because the stuff that we take in is really not harmless.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   It really can harm our souls.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500]   You know, it can provoke lust in our hearts and desires in our hearts.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500]   And that can lead to even kind of more explicit things.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   And so for me, when I think about pop culture and kind of explicit sexuality, it's just not a risk worth taking.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   You know, I just I just don't want to leave space for that in my life.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   I don't want to make sure I have space to take those kind of risks.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   And as far as how it works in with our relevance, relevance is a really good thing.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   And understanding pop culture is a really good thing.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   But, you know, neither of those things are more important than your soul itself.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   And so we're fooling ourselves if we think seeing an episode of a TV show or seeing a movie is more important to reaching people than our own personal purity or devotion to God.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   You know, your holiness is more important to your ministry than your pop culture knowledge, because, you know, a holy life is going to say more, a lot more about Christ than anecdotes from a popular TV show or quoting this thing from this episode.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Second Timothy 221, Paul says to Timothy, "If anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work."
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   That holiness and set apartness to be useful for God is a very real thing.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500]   And so it's good to be relevant. I like to keep up with pop culture.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   And I can even think of ways, even as I wrote the book Rise, where I pointed to pop culture.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   I think it strengthened my argument. And so I'm not in any way saying that doesn't matter.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   But our souls are far more important and it's just not a risk worth us taking.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   So I would encourage us not to do that and to find other ways to try to be relevant.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.500]   Well said, Tripp. Thank you. And if you're still not convinced, John Piper took up this topic.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   And to find what he said, Google the title, "12 Questions to Ask Before You Watch Game of Thrones."
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   Well, I have several more questions for Tripp. So we're going to extend our time with him into next week.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   And on Monday, we will talk about a love affair with an iPhone, a classic track from an earlier album by Tripp and a song he called "I Love."
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   And you'll want to know what Tripp has learned about avoiding iPhone idolatry in the past few years.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast. And have a wonderful weekend.
