[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Well, today is 9/11.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   It's a sober day here in America, but today's question is not about 9/11.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.520]   Today we actually have a question about a haunting text in the pastoral epistles.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.600]   The question comes in from a podcast listener named Amy.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.280]   "Hello, Pastor Jon, and thank you for APJ.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.240]   My struggle is deep and personal.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   I'm not maturing much in the faith.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.520]   I forget just about everything I learn as soon as I learn it.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.240]   Sermons pass in and out of my ears and I take away from them just about nothing, or so it
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.240]   seems.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.200]   I fear I'm the one mentioned in Scripture as 'always learning and never able to arrive
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.720]   at a knowledge of the truth.'"
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.560]   2 Timothy 3:7.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.960]   Can you explain this verse to me, and what does it here mean to "arrive at a knowledge
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.760]   of the truth"?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.080]   What would that look like?
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.000]   Pastor Jon, what would you say to Amy?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.360]   Well, I'm very glad that Amy is even open to considering the possibility she might be
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.880]   like one of the women described in 2 Timothy 3, 6, and 7.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.800]   That in itself is a mark of spiritual life, it seems, because very few women who in fact
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.560]   are the kind of women described in these verses would have any humility to admit that they
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.000]   were the kind of woman who's in these verses.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120]   So here's what it says.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.640]   Let's get the verses in front of us.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.800]   Paul is writing to Timothy about a certain kind of man who does certain things with women,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.560]   and they are a certain kind of woman.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.380]   And let's read now what's the man doing and what kind of woman is vulnerable to what this
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.380]   man is doing.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   Here's what he says.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.880]   This is 2 Timothy 3, 6.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.800]   "For among them," that is, those dangerous men, "are those who creep in to households
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:18.140]   and capture weak women, heaped up with sins and led by various passions, always learning
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.680]   and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth."
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.920]   Now, Amy wonders if her difficulty in not maturing as much as she would like in the
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.960]   Christian faith and in forgetting so much of what she hears in sermons, does this mean
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.640]   that she's one of these women who can never come to a knowledge of the truth?
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.800]   Now, I don't know Amy.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.440]   I don't know the extent of what she thinks her weaknesses are.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.840]   I don't know the quality of teaching she's receiving.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.920]   I don't know her own battles with sin.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.140]   So I'm in no position to pronounce about whether she could be in the category of these
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.500]   women in 2 Timothy.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:14.040]   What I can do is describe the situation here in these verses with a little more attention
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.280]   so that she then can measure whether or not her particular difficulties that she's described
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.120]   put her in this category.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:33.760]   My own sense right now, given what I see, is that she's not in this category, and you'll
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   see why as we unpack these two verses.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.720]   First, the women are described as weak women, so we must ask, "So what's the nature of
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.400]   their weakness?"
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.760]   And Paul leads us along the way toward the answer with the next phrase, namely, "They
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.080]   are heaped up with sins."
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.960]   It's a dramatic word.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.360]   It's the same word as Paul uses in Romans 12 for heaping, coals of fire on people's
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.080]   heads, piles and piles of sins that these women are committing.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.880]   So we should ask, "Well, what's the nature of the weakness that results in these women
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   committing sin after sin such that they pile up?"
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.500]   And the next thing Paul says goes a long way to answering that.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.880]   He says, "They are being led by various desires or passions."
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.720]   Now we're at the heart of the matter.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.480]   They are always learning and cannot come to the truth, never arrive, because they are
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:55.040]   being led not by truth but are being led, controlled by desires, passions, instead of
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.400]   being led by the truth.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.600]   So let's read backwards now.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.320]   They can't arrive at the truth because they are controlled and led by all kinds of various
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.480]   desires rather than discerning and submitting to the truth.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   And being led by those desires, they are led into sin after sin, which creates a huge heap
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.840]   upon them, and that, Paul says, makes them weak and thus vulnerable to these rascals
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.180]   who are coming in with their false teaching and maybe even more abusive behavior than
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.160]   false teaching.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.720]   These women are not like Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and absorbed so much truth.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.680]   They're not like Priscilla, who understood the way of truth better than Apollos did.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.340]   They're weak, meaning when desires come, they don't stand strong against them and
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.520]   govern them with the truth.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.920]   They give way, and that's what it means to be weak here.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.840]   They give way to sinful desires, and so they are led like a ring in their nose.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.580]   They're led by passions, not truth.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.680]   So they arrive at sin after sin, not ever-deepening knowledge of the truth.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.960]   Now what can we say about this text that might help Amy get her bearings?
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.280]   Three things.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   First, Amy describes her main problem, as far as she can see it, as a problem of a weak
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.880]   memory, not a weak morality.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.960]   The problem in this text is not that these women have weak memories.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.040]   The problem is that they have no power to stand over against their desires and deny
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.320]   them and be led by truth against them.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   That's the problem.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.720]   Now Amy will have to decide, I don't know Amy, she'll have to decide if that's her
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.040]   struggle.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040]   But it's not what she mentions.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.840]   All of us have very different capacities for remembering things.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:15.320]   I consider my own memory, my capacities to remember to be weak and getting weaker, by
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   the way.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.200]   Which means, and I mean always, I can remember in college taking history classes and working
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.400]   my tail off till two in the morning, memorizing dates, trying to figure out acronyms, remember
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   places.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.240]   And I had to work so much harder, it seemed, than everybody else just to get a B in this
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   history class.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.160]   Same thing with sermon preparation.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.560]   To give a sermon or to give a talk where you just use notes instead of a manuscript is
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.840]   enormous amount of work.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.600]   So God has made life harder for me in this regard, and I do not doubt that was his will
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:07.080]   and that it is good for me to have to work harder on memorizing Scripture than others
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.520]   do.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:16.180]   And I would suggest to Amy that there may be simple strategies of, instead of rolling
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:23.680]   over and playing victim, there may be strategies of repetition and note-taking and journal
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.560]   keeping and so on that could supplement a weaker memory.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.640]   That's the first thing.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:38.380]   Second thing I would say is that the knowledge of truth referred to in verse 7 is probably
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:45.760]   not truth in general, but in fact the core message of the gospel.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.240]   I say that because the way that term is used, the exact term in Greek, knowledge of the
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.360]   truth, 1 Timothy 2.4, 2 Timothy 2.25, Titus 1.1, you can look all those up and test to
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.240]   see if you agree with what I'm saying.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.380]   The point I'm saying is these women are called weak not because they didn't have a systematic
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.380]   theology.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.560]   That's not the issue.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.300]   Coming to a knowledge of the truth doesn't mean coming to a knowledge of Wayne Grudem's
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.160]   systematic theology.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:23.780]   The point is that in their desire-controlled hearts, they were so resistant to seeing the
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:31.340]   gospel as beautiful and desirable above all things that they could not understand it in
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.240]   any depth, and therefore they could not hold onto it as the treasure of their lives, and
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.640]   therefore they were led about by lesser desires.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.000]   And the question I would ask Amy is, does she have a firm grasp of the gospel, of what
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.380]   God did in Jesus Christ for her in history and what he has done in her heart?
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.580]   Does she grasp that central core truth that is so stabilizing against being jerked around
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.920]   by our desires?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.880]   And the last thing I would say is that just a few verses earlier, that is, chapter 2,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:22.540]   verse 25, Paul had given the divine solution to the problem of not coming to a knowledge
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.540]   of the truth.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.120]   Here's what he says.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.000]   Very same phrase.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   In other words, ultimately, arriving at a knowledge of the truth is a gift of God.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.060]   God may perhaps grant them knowledge of the truth.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:55.640]   The bondage of our desires and the bondage of Satan, the blindness of our hearts, is
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.580]   hopeless, a hopeless condition, without divine intervention.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:09.980]   So the remedy is to pray for God's mighty grace to break in and give us the victory
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:18.420]   over bondage to sinful passions so that we arrive at a saving knowledge of the truth.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.220]   Very very helpful, Pastor John.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   Thank you.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.940]   I hope you find this encouraging, Amy.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.820]   Thanks for the great question.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.260]   Keep those great questions coming in.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.260]   And I appreciate all of you who've listened to the podcast to search all the episodes
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.940]   that we have published to date, or to browse our archive of episodes, or to submit a question
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.900]   to us like Amy did today.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:46.060]   Do all of that online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.180]   Another thing that you can do at the homepage—and I don't mention this very often, but there's
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.180]   a really interesting feature that we've built into the homepage for you.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.240]   At the homepage, if you go there to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn, you can browse the archive of episodes
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.580]   either by date, getting the latest episodes first, and that's the default.
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   If you go to that page, you'll see a button that says "Recent."
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.340]   That's been pressed automatically.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.980]   But you can toggle that button to a list called "Popular."
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.980]   You can click on the Popular button to see a real-time list of our episodes that have
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.660]   garnered the most plays all time.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:26.060]   And that list—and you can scroll down and you can keep unfurling it—as many episodes
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.980]   as you want, the top 100, top 1,000 episodes, whatever you want.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.300]   That list remains current every single day.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.060]   So it's a really cool feature if you want to see our hit list, so to speak.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.020]   Again, that's all available at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.740]   I am not sure what's on the table for Monday's episode, but there will be an episode, Lord
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.740]   willing.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.820]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we plan to see you on Monday.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.460]   Until then, have a wonderful weekend.
