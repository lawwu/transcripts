[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:15.160]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, the 23rd chapter, verses 6, 7 and 8. Verses 6,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:24.920]   7 and 8 in the 23rd chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. But when Paul perceived
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.680]   that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Men
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.200]   and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. Of the hope and resurrection of
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:48.040]   the dead I am called in question." And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.200]   the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided. For the Sadducees say that there
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.000]   is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess both. And the account
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.320]   goes on to tell us that there arose a great cry, and that the dissension became so great
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.640]   that the chief captain in charge of the soldiers, fearing that in their vile disputation they
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.600]   might even tear the apostle's limb from limb, had to intervene and to rescue him and
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.240]   to take him to a place of safety.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.840]   Now this is one of those memorable scenes in the life and ministry of this remarkable
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.920]   man, the apostle Paul. Here is a man, you remember, who as he has just reminded this
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.640]   council, was a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee. A man who had been brought up as
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.280]   a very strict religious Jew and Pharisee, and who for years had opposed bitterly the
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.640]   Lord Jesus Christ and the truth concerning him, and who had indeed felt that his greatest
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.280]   work on earth was in a sense to destroy the Christian church. But you remember what happened
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.680]   to him going on the road to Damascus to carry out that very intention. Suddenly, about midday,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:25.400]   he was given that vision of the risen Lord Jesus Christ, and his whole life was changed.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.720]   And from being the bitterest persecutor of the Christian church, he became its greatest
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.600]   preacher, and went about preaching in various countries, not sparing himself, traveling
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.240]   and working, preaching, weeping day and night, so that he stands out in the records as the
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.480]   mightiest evangelist that the Christian church has ever known.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   But here he is at this moment on trial. He has been arrested. He is in charge actually
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.160]   of the Roman authorities. The Roman Empire, you remember, had conquered Palestine just
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.640]   prior to these things, so they were responsible for law and order. And they had heard that
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.680]   there was a great dispute going on amongst the Jews with respect to this man Paul, and
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.120]   they had intervened in order to prevent a riot. And they were anxious to know what it
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.360]   was all about. So they called the apostle forward before the council and asked him to
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.640]   speak for himself. And here the record tells us that Paul observing
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.480]   something which was quite familiar to him, that the council seemed to be divided as between
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   Sadducees and Pharisees. Church to say that he was a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.280]   and that he was really being called in question, because he had gone about preaching that Jesus
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.200]   of Nazareth was the Son of God, and that his proof of that was that he had risen from the
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.760]   grave. He had gone around saying that this person whom people regarded as but a man,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   Jesus, a carpenter from Nazareth, was none other than the eternal Son of God, who had
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.200]   come into this world to save men, to rescue them from their sins and from the wrath of
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.400]   God. And that his proof of that fact was that though men had taken him and had crucified
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.720]   him, and had taken down his body from the tree, and had buried it in a grave, and had
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   rolled a stone over it, that he had risen out of it, that he couldn't be held by death,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.000]   that he had disappeared, he had indeed risen again, the first truly to rise from the dead,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.400]   and had manifested himself to his disciples and various chosen people, and then had ascended
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.080]   up into heaven in their very sight. And he had a further proof. He, Paul himself, as
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.960]   I've just reminded you, had seen him with his naked eyes on the road to Damascus. He
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   didn't realize at first who it was. He just saw a face that was so glorious that he was
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.600]   blinded by it. He'd never seen such a face, nor such an expression. And he cried out saying,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.720]   "Who art thou, Lord?" And back came to him the astonishing and shattering reply, "I
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.400]   am Jesus, whom thou persecuted. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." That
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.520]   was to him the final proof, the thing, I say, that not only convinced his intellect, but
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.920]   changed his whole life, and turned him into a preacher and an apostle of the Lord Jesus
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.080]   Christ. Well, now here he is, I say, on trial, and he makes this statement. And the effect
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:54.280]   of that was that a great dispute arose at once, no longer between Paul and the council,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.800]   but between the different members of the council, the Sadducees and Pharisees, and they almost
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.680]   came to blows. And there was great excitement, and the chief captain has to rescue the apostle.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:14.680]   Now I call your attention to this story, this bit of history, on this Easter Sunday evening,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.520]   because it seems to me that it is a very perfect and exact description of the world tonight.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   As I read this story, I see nothing but men and women today. Of course, this is a little
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.280]   picture, and I am talking about the great world, but as I want to try to show you the
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.680]   description, it is really identical, there is no difference at all. Here in miniature,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.120]   as it were, in these words, we have got a description and a picture of mankind this
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:57.080]   very evening, because we are constantly being reminded of it, are we not, these days? The
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.320]   world does not change. I mean by that that men and women do not change. Of course, we
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.800]   have got motor cars and aeroplanes, and we are talking about something called an atomic
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   bomb. They did not know anything about things like that. But they were men and women, as
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.760]   we are, and it is men and women who do not change. Whether you walk to commit sin or
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.120]   whether you fly in an aeroplane makes no difference, you are still committing sin. That is the
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.040]   important thing. Oh yes, there are great changes and developments in the means of locomotion,
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.240]   and in our treatment of diseases and many other things. But, oh, as we shall see as
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.600]   we unfold this story, man as man does not change at all. He is exactly what he was nearly
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.240]   two thousand years ago. And what I want to try to show this evening is that all who are
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:59.440]   not Christians are simply identical with the members of that council whom the Apostle Paul
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.840]   was addressing on this occasion. Now let me show it to you like this. Look at the picture.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:14.800]   Look at the tragedy. See these men busy with their discussions and their arguments and
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.640]   their disputations, and while they are busy with that, ignoring the Son of God and the
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:29.760]   truth that is in him. That is the tragedy of this picture. Sadducees and Pharisees and
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   scribes, all religious people, all believers in God and all concerned about God and worshipping
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.560]   God and about life and how life is to be lived and so on, and there they are arguing and
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:48.960]   disputing and quarrelling and becoming violent, and in the meantime ignoring altogether the
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.720]   Son of God, the Saviour of the world, the one who has got the answer to every question,
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.640]   the solution to every problem, the one who has solved every difficulty. That is the tragedy
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   of this picture, isn't it? It is the tragedy of the world tonight. Yes, the world is arguing
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.280]   and debating and disputing what can be done, how can we put things right. They are honest,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.560]   they are sincere, they are zealous, of course they are. All these people are, as they were
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.720]   in this picture, and there the world is tonight occupied about these things and talking and
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:38.200]   debating and becoming heated and excited. And the Son of God, forgotten and ignored,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.880]   the fact that he ever left heaven and came on earth, not thought of. The fact that he
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   died on the cross for sin, not remembered. The fact that he arose triumphant from the
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:59.440]   grave and is the first to rise from the dead, doesn't enter into calculations at all.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.560]   It's the tragedy of the world. And alas, it's far too often the tragedy of the Church
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.200]   herself that instead of talking about him they are talking about how to stop the use
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.360]   of hydrogen bombs. While we are discussing the bombs, he is being ignored, and there
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   he is with his message, his answer. But we are so busy, we forget all about him. That
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:31.160]   was what was happening in this council chamber. While they were so busy discussing, he was
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.680]   just being forgotten. And this great world, with its teeming masses tonight, with all
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:47.440]   its concerns and interests, is guilty of precisely the same thing. He is forgotten and ignored.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:55.800]   What a tragedy that God's word to men, God's offer to men, is not even being considered
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.320]   by so many masses of people. But let me go on to a second thing that strikes us on the
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:08.280]   very surface of this picture. Observe the significance that these men attach to their
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.160]   divisions and to their points of view, and their complete failure to see that finally
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:25.720]   these don't matter at all because they are all basically one. You read this account,
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   as you read it superficially and rather cursorily, if someone were to ask you, "How many people
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.160]   were there on that occasion in that room?" you would say at once, "Three." Well,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.080]   who were they? Well, there was Paul, that was one point of view, there were the Sadducees,
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.040]   there were the Pharisees, one, two, three. But that's wrong. There were only two points
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.640]   of view. Paul, and all who didn't agree with Paul, whether Pharisees or Sadducees
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.280]   doesn't matter. That's the only real division. There were only two points of view there.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:05.240]   But you see to them this subdivision was tremendously important. Pharisees, Sadducees, with their
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:11.520]   respective positions and arguments about which I shall remind you in a moment. And they think
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.840]   this is very important, and they attach great significance to it. And they're absolutely
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:23.760]   blind to the fact that really there is no meaning fundamentally and finally in all their
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.720]   disagreements. I'm suggesting this evening that it's exactly the same with the world
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:39.960]   tonight. The world is divided up into almost endless categories. And different people divide
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:47.560]   them up in different ways. Some people divide up mankind according to wealth, the rich and
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:56.120]   the poor. Some divide mankind up according to social status. Those who have access into
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:06.160]   the highest circles, the people who are very high up, just a few, and the common people,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.720]   the masses. And to them these divisions are very significant. Others divide them up into
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.800]   learned and ignorant. "Oh, I mustn't waste your time." They divide them up politically.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.320]   They divide them up economically, and so on. And of course these things to them are so
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.240]   important and so vital. They'll argue about them like these people did. They'll quarrel
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.880]   about them. They'll envy one another and fight with one another. They'll pay money
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.520]   to get into different groups and divisions and so on. These are the big things and the
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:47.760]   important things to them. And they'll fight for them, they'll die for them. And yet,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   you know, in the last analysis, these divisions and distinctions are absolutely irrelevant.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:04.680]   There's only one major distinction in the world, Christian, non-Christian. One touch
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:12.680]   of nature makes the whole world kill. And when you scratch beneath the surface of men's
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:19.640]   skins or their ideas, you come across exactly the same thing. We're all the same. We're
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:27.880]   all common clay. We're all this curious mixture and amalgam of hereditary and environmental
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:34.680]   forces and factors and powers latent within us, lust, passion, desire, envy. We're all
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.400]   the same. And yet how much we make of the divisions and distinctions, savagery and pharisee,
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.560]   tremendously important, according to this book, irrelevant.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:54.880]   And the third general point which I see here is this one. I see a very perfect and a final
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:03.920]   exposure about the fellow, about the difficulty with respect to the Christian faith. Now the
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:13.720]   common thing to say today is that the real difficulty about Christianity is intellectual.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.560]   Most people today who are not Christian are never tired of telling us that they are in
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.800]   that position because of their minds, because of their intellects, because of their knowledge,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.640]   because of their understanding. Oh, I mustn't waste your time in describing it again. You're
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.720]   all perfectly familiar with it. The fact is that the average man today who's not a Christian
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.960]   feels rather sorry for those of us who are Christian. They feel that some or other way
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.600]   lacking in intellect. It's just because we don't know things. We have lived in obscurity.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:49.520]   We are obscurantists and so on. It's a question of intellect, they say. But here this story
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:56.600]   explodes that once more and once and forever. It wasn't intellect that caused the division
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:04.560]   in that council chamber. It wasn't intellect that divided Pharisees from Sadducees. And
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.640]   it wasn't intellect that divided Pharisees and Sadducees on the one hand from Paul on
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.320]   the other. The difference between the Pharisee and the Sadducee was not intellectual ability
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.440]   and the human. It isn't that at all. And I say the thing that makes Paul different from
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.460]   both the other groups is not a matter of intellect. You see, he in and of himself settles that
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:31.760]   argument once and forever. Paul was the same man intellectually before his conversion as
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.640]   he was afterwards. He didn't decide to throw his intellect overboard when he became a Christian.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.800]   I can prove that very easily. If you want an intellectual bit of exercise, well, I've
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:47.400]   got it for you. Begin to study Paul's epistles. And if you're interested in logic and in
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.080]   intellectual gymnastics, well, you've got more than enough there for the rest of your
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:59.440]   life. One of the giant intellects of all the ages, handling the profundities and the immensity,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.360]   the same intellect after as before. This isn't a question of intellect, my friend. I'm
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.080]   going to show you that in detail in a moment. But let me make this general point here. If
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.240]   there's anybody listening to me at this moment who says, "No, I can't believe your Christianity.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.880]   My intellect can't accept this resurrection fact of yours," let me tell you at once,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:28.520]   it isn't your intellect that causes the trouble. The difficulties in this matter are never
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:35.640]   intellectual. They're on a much deeper level. They're moral. And they're even bigger and
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:43.080]   deeper than that. The intellect is the least important factor. It is something which the
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.960]   Bible calls sin, which produces blindness, which renders the intellect incapable of working
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.800]   truly. It's an intellect in blinkers. It's an intellect that's warped and perverted,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.000]   and it needs to be set at liberty. It isn't intellectual. It's something that affects
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.840]   the intellect. Deeper than it, sin. All that, it seems to me, is suggested here on the very
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:13.860]   surface because, after all, the Sadducees and Pharisees and Paul were in a sense equally
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:19.280]   gifted intellectually, were confronting the same facts, were concerned about the same
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:28.120]   things, and had a very similar kind of training and of background. Very well. All this leads
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:35.360]   me to lay down one great fundamental proposition. The only thing that matters in the world this
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:43.320]   evening is belief and unbelief. That's what it all comes to. Standing there in the background,
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:51.080]   as I say, ignored and forgotten, is the Son of God, the One who came into the world and
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.160]   whose coming has made us call this year 1955, the One who divides history into B.C. and
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.680]   A.D. There He remains, and I say only one thing matters, whether we believe in Him or
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:12.960]   whether we don't believe in Him, belief or unbelief. And because this is such a vital
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   matter, because not only our immediate happiness but our eternal future and our eternal bliss
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.200]   and welfare depend upon our relationship to Him and our belief in Him, it's because
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.120]   of that I would plead with you to consider with me the picture that we are given here
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.600]   in this incident of the characteristics of unbelief and the characteristics of belief.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.240]   It's the only thing that matters. Let me show it to you.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.720]   What are the characteristics of unbelief? Well, don't they appear in the light of
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:20:00.000]   this history, this story, to be rather fatuous? Doesn't it seem to be rather irrelevant
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.640]   in all its activity? Doesn't it seem to be an utter waste of time? Doesn't the hurl
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.040]   of life apart from Christ in this incident appear to be a pure waste of time and a sham
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.800]   and a pretense and a make-belief? What do you mean, sir? Someone will let me put it
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:28.360]   like this to you. As you look at these people who are not Christians in this council chamber,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:38.440]   at first you rather feel that their groupings and divisions are very real and very important.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.840]   Now look at these two groups, these Sadducees and Pharisees. I say it appears at first to
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:48.280]   be a very real and a very important and a very vital distinction. We are even told it
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:56.560]   here like this, that there is this difference between these two groups. We are told that
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:04.960]   the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:15.080]   confess both. Now you say, speaking philosophically, this is surely rather important. There is
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   an obvious and rather a vital difference between the Sadducees and the Pharisees, therefore.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.880]   The Sadducees were materialists, they were rationalists, and they didn't admit the
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.240]   supernatural. They didn't believe in the miraculous, they didn't believe in angels,
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.320]   they didn't believe in spirits. But the Pharisees were very different. Now they say
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.280]   that isn't so, there is this miraculous element, the supernatural will keep on breaking
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   in. There's no question, they said, about angels. And there they are, these two groups,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.800]   and you look at them at first, I say, you're rather impressed by the difference. But you
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.320]   know their differences didn't stop at that point. They disagreed and differed also in
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:06.760]   their attitude toward the Lord Jesus Christ. The Sadducees did not believe in him and rejected
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:14.520]   him because of this claim that he had risen from the dead. That was their main ground
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.600]   for rejecting him. They said, we will not believe this person, we will not believe the
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.080]   truth concerning him, because his followers claim that he rose from the dead. Now they
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.040]   said that is impossible because nobody can rise from the dead. Such a thing is impossible.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.200]   And because it's impossible it hasn't happened, and therefore if their whole faith
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.960]   is based upon the statement that it has happened, it must be wrong, therefore we are not Christians.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.560]   And it's such logic that you can't find a flaw in it. It seems perfectly established.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:54.360]   They, the Sadducees, rejected Christ because it is claimed that he rose again. The objection
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:01.960]   to them was the resurrection. What was the matter with the Pharisees then? Why did the
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.480]   Pharisees reject Christ? Well, not because of the resurrection as we see in the story.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:14.200]   Well, why did they reject him and the message concerning him? Well, they rejected him because
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.920]   of his death. They had no trouble about the resurrection, but they couldn't believe
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.480]   in his resurrection because his death was a stumbling block. In what way? Well, in this
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:33.840]   way. These Pharisees were the religious teachers of the Jews, and they had been teaching, it
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:40.240]   was the tradition amongst them, that a great Messiah was going to come, that God had promised
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.920]   to send a Messiah, a deliverer, into the world, and especially to deliver the children of
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:51.360]   Israel. And their idea about the Messiah was this, that he would come as a great king,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.800]   as a mighty military personage, that he'd gather together all the lost tribes of Israel,
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.960]   he'd set himself at the head of a great army, and with his incomparable strategy he'd
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.600]   rout the Roman army, he'd smash the Roman Empire. Israel, the Jews, would be the greatest
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:13.680]   nation on the face of the earth. The whole world would be doing its obeisance to Palestine
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.240]   and to Jewry with this great king conquering at the head. They were looking forward to
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:27.160]   his coming. They preached about him. They held the picture before the people. But these
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:38.080]   miserable people called Christians were saying that a person who'd come and was born out
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.320]   of a poor family, so poor that when he was born they couldn't afford to offer a lamb,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:51.920]   according to the law, they couldn't afford anything but just two turtle doves. Born in
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:58.640]   the family of Artisans, Andrew had worked with his hands as a carpenter, and he'd started
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:05.840]   preaching at the age of thirty, with nothing regal apparently about him at all, followed
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.760]   by a rebel of poor people who didn't matter and who didn't count, who was asked on certain
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.440]   occasions when he'd done rather striking things, "Go up to Jerusalem, declare yourself,
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.680]   and refuse to do so." And in the end, the thing was so appalling they could scarcely
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:29.480]   mention it, such was their sarcasm and their scorn. He was taken and crucified in utter
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:38.280]   weakness between two thieves on a cross on a hill called Calvary. And yet these Christians,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:44.800]   these miserable people say that this is the Messiah, the Deliverer, the Son of God. Impossible
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.720]   nonsense. Incredible.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:57.440]   However, the distinction seems to be between Pharisees and scribes. The Sadducees reject
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:07.320]   him because he rose again, the Pharisees reject him because he died. You see, the distinction,
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.600]   the division seems to be very real, doesn't it? Yes, but that leads me at once to my second
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.960]   point which is this. The story tells us that these divisions and distinctions always cancel
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:27.400]   one another out. Don't forget my major principle which is this, that unbelief is always a way
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:37.360]   of fatuous, that unbelief is always ridiculous, that unbelief is always a waste of time. And
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   here it is. It appears to be imposing and wonderful based on arguments and understanding
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:50.120]   and intellect. But you see that in reality it cancels itself out. Its divisions negative
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.960]   and nullify one another. Now, this is always true of unbelief. Had you ever realized that,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:04.680]   I wonder. Here it is to perfection. The Sadducees and Pharisees cancel one another out completely.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:10.920]   They didn't know that, but it's a fact. Yes, but unbelief is always guilty of this.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:17.240]   Do you remember how our Lord put it on one occasion? He said, "What can you do with
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:23.520]   men like this?" He was talking about his own generation that didn't believe in him.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.680]   He said, "What can be done with them?" He said, "They're like children playing
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.080]   and crying in the marketplaces saying, 'We have piped unto you and ye have not danced.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:43.000]   We have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented.' John the Baptist," he said, "came eating
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:51.400]   and drinking and they say he hath a devil. The Son of Man is come eating and drinking
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.000]   and they say, 'Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.'
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.760]   John was an abstemious man. He lived in the desert. He ate nothing but locusts and wild
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.160]   honey. Neither eating nor drinking, a devil they say. The Son of Man does the exact opposite.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.680]   Still, they're not satisfied. They say, 'Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber,
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:20.080]   a friend of publicans and of sinners.'" You see, always arguing against themselves,
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.560]   calling one another out, always complaining, and it's equally true in the modern world.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.640]   Take all the unbelievers in the world tonight. Take the people to whom this Easter Sunday
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.280]   means nothing at all, and who rather think that they're tremendously superior because
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.400]   they don't believe in such folklore and such nonsense. Look at the great mass of unbelievers.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:47.600]   Now you realize, don't you, they're not all the same. There are some spending their
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.040]   evening in public houses tonight just drinking and getting drunk, and perhaps making jokes
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.800]   about it. Yes, but there are others who are members of very learned societies and are
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   doing the same thing in a different way. But you see, they cancel one another out in a
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:11.120]   most extraordinary manner. The first people I mentioned, they have no use for Christianity.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:18.680]   Why? Well, they say it's too serious. Takes all the fun and laughter out of life. Then
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.560]   you go to the others and you say, "Well, now why are you not Christians?" "Oh,"
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.600]   they say, "look at these evangelistic meetings. It's too light, it's too flippant. They
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.200]   don't take the thing seriously enough." Or take another view of these unbelievers.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.880]   Half the unbelievers in the world seem to say that they're not Christians because Christianity
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.120]   is too difficult. They say, "Look at your sermon on the mount. Who can live a life like
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.040]   that? It's impossible. The standard is too exalted." They've often said it, listening
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.600]   to me preaching here. They say, "You know, that man puts the standard so high, he makes
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.160]   it impossible for us, he condemns us." But the other half are saying equally vociferously,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.960]   "No, no, the trouble with that Christianity is it's too easy. It tells you that you
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.080]   can be forgiven for nothing. That all you've got to do is to believe in the Lord Jesus
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.480]   Christ. All your sins are forgiven. You're chosen in him, you're justified in him, you're
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.440]   sanctified in him. It's an easy religion." They say, "I don't believe it. It means
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:22.040]   resting on a bed of roses and being carried helplessly to heaven." Too hard, too easy.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   You see, the world doesn't change, does it? Because he's dead, because he's alive,
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.280]   cancelling one on and one out. Too hard, too easy, too simple, too involved. Too high,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:43.840]   too low. Oh, our Lord said the truth about the world, didn't he? Unbelief is hopeless.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.440]   Unbelief cannot be satisfied. Doesn't matter what you do. Whether you send John the Baptist,
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.600]   whether you send the Son of God, it doesn't make any difference. They always want something
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:00.760]   else. They're always cancelling one on and one out in the center. What a miserable thing
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.820]   unbelief is. Yes, but let me put it finally in this way. The really fatuous element in
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:15.160]   unbelief is seen here. That ultimately, of course, all the much vaunted and bursted divisions
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:23.440]   and distinctions and groups and ideas are all one. The divisions and distinctions are
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.360]   only on the surface. Fundamentally, they're all absolutely identical. Let me show you
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.240]   the things in which they're identical in this very picture. Can't you see that they're
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:42.600]   all equally governed by their own theories and by their own prejudices? A Pharisee, son
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:48.960]   of a Pharisee, brought up amongst the Pharisees, teaching of the Pharisees. You start with
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.680]   it, you see, and it's your prejudice. The other man said, you see, belongs to the other
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:58.760]   party. And each one is absolutely governed by his prejudice, by his own theory, and by
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.660]   his own idea. That's true of every unbeliever in the world tonight. He starts with a prejudice
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:13.820]   and he holds on to it. They're all the same, they're all prejudiced. Whatever a man of
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:20.480]   the world may say against the Christian, there is one thing he can never say against him.
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.260]   He can never say that the Christian is too small to change his mind. You can't become
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:33.660]   a Christian without changing your mind. That's called repentance, metanahia, change of mind.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.780]   It's to change your mind is a big thing, and it is. It's a very small person who says,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.020]   "I've always said, and I've always said I'm going to say." Oh, there's nothing
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:48.700]   smaller or more despicable than that. But that's the position of unbelief. It's always
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:55.180]   said it and it's still saying it. It's so prejudiced that it isn't ready to think
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:33:00.500]   again and to change its point of view. They're all identical. Whether they're the great
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:08.340]   philosophers in the select clubs or whether they're making the common rebel jokes in
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:18.060]   the bar parlor. The second thing I find in common is this, that they're all so prejudiced
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   that they'll go to almost any lengths conceivable to prove their own point. This is really very
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.740]   laughable. I wonder whether you notice this element in this story. We are told that there
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:39.500]   arose a great cry, and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose and strove,
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.740]   saying, "We find no evil in this man, but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him,
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.860]   let us not fight against God." You know, these Pharisees were so anxious to damn the
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.180]   Sadducees that they very nearly said that Paul was right. They didn't, of course, because
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.260]   they didn't believe that. But in order to prove that the Sadducees were wrong and that
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.620]   the Pharisees were right, their party, not the other, they were almost ready to say,
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:12.700]   "You know, this man's right. Let's let him go." Oh, what a terrible thing prejudice
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:20.860]   is. Did you notice what we were told in that 28th chapter of Matthew? These wretched Pharisees
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:29.260]   and Sadducees, when their own soldiers and guards came to them and told them what had
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:35.660]   happened, that the stone had been rolled away by some unseen power, and that the body had
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.620]   disappeared in a manner they didn't know, when they came and told them the very facts,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:48.780]   you remember what they did? They bribed them to tell a lie. That's prejudice. So anxious
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:53.340]   to maintain its argument and to get its point and to win against the opponent, it'll stop
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:58.820]   at nothing. It'll twist, it'll change, it'll be dishonest, it'll manufacture facts. And
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.340]   it's happening in the world today. You read it in the newspapers. This whole hoax of evolution
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.820]   is a most perfect illustration of it. We've just had an exposure recently, haven't we?
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.700]   For it's a part of the same thing, you know. It's a part of manipulation of the evidence,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.460]   you see. And the twisting of things. You start with a theory, in the next few pages you refer
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.940]   to your theory as a fact, and then you go on with your argument on facts, as it were.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:30.740]   That's the dishonesty of unbelief. It's all in this old story. There is no length
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:38.180]   to which prejudice and unbelief will not carry its victims. They were all exactly the same.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:45.820]   The Pharisees and Sadducees were equally prejudiced and equally dishonest in their method of argumentation.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:52.220]   The other thing I find in common between them is this. They're all equally guilty of the
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:36:00.740]   scriptures. These men were the religious leaders. These men were the men who knew the Old Testament
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:06.580]   and were supposed to read it and to expound it to the people. But they were all equally
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:13.620]   blind with respect to it and its message. The Old Testament taught the miraculous, it
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.620]   taught the doctrine of spirits, and it taught the doctrine of angels, it prophesied and
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:24.300]   predicted that the Messiah would be killed and would rise again. It's all there, and
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:31.340]   they were ignorant of it. Our Lord accused them of the same thing on that occasion, you
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.900]   remember, when the Sadducees came to him about this very question of resurrection and put
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:40.460]   the case of the woman who married the seven brothers, you remember. He said, "You know
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:48.900]   not the scriptures. You do err not knowing the scriptures." And exactly the same with
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:55.420]   the Pharisees. Our Lord turned to them one day and said, "Forget the scriptures. You
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.580]   believe them, and you believe that in them you have life. They are the very things that
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:06.740]   have spoken of me. Why don't you believe me then?" The scriptures had told of his
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:13.820]   death plainly and clearly. But these Pharisees were so blinded by their prejudice about the
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.900]   Messiah that he must be a great military personage and conqueror, that they were so blinded by
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.780]   it that even when they read their own scriptures they couldn't see his death, his sacrificial
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:34.940]   atoning death. They are ignorant of the scriptures, all of them equally so.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:43.900]   And the most ignorant drunkard in this country tonight, and your most learned and brilliant
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:54.940]   philosopher, are equally ignorant of spiritual truth. The ignorance of your Bertrand Russell
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.900]   is identical with the ignorance of a man who has never opened a book on philosophy in his
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:08.220]   life. Spiritually they are equally blind and equally ignorant. There is no difference,
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:15.220]   none whatsoever. The next thing I find in common is this, that
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:22.740]   they are all equally determined in their refusal to face the facts, and for the reason that
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:29.860]   the facts do not fit into their theories. The Pharisees reject the facts about him,
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:39.820]   and the Sadducees reject the facts about Christ. They are equal in their rejection of facts.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.680]   To put it finally, then I say this, that they are identical and there is no difference at
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:56.740]   all in this ultimate point. They don't believe in him. They refuse him. They reject him.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.860]   What's it matter whether you are a Pharisee or a Sadducee if you don't believe in Christ?
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:06.020]   What's it matter if you are the greatest philosopher in the world or a crossing sweeper
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.420]   if you don't know him, the Son of God, and your personal Saviour? It doesn't matter.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:18.020]   You are a common denominator. And there they are all one. There is none
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:28.580]   righteous, no, not one. The whole world lieth guilty before God. All mankind is one in sin
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:36.820]   and failure and shame and alienation against God. Oh, the fatuity of unbelief! Oh, the
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.140]   fuss and the excitement about its divisions and distinctions and its advances and its
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.820]   differences! They are irrelevant. They don't count. They are a sure waste of time. You
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:54.140]   are all the same in the end. It is our relationship to him that matters and nothing else.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:59.740]   Well, let me put that positively in a final word in giving to you the lineaments and the
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:06.900]   characteristics of belief. What is it that characterizes belief? Well, here's the first
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:17.300]   one. Belief always starts with the facts. The others, as I've been showing you, always
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:27.260]   start with prejudices and refuse facts. Belief starts with facts. I do want to emphasize
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:36.820]   that, you know. I cannot accept the statement that belief starts with feelings. Belief leads
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.740]   to feelings. If people come to me and say they've experienced something wonderful,
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.180]   and when I ask them what it is, they can't tell me, I'm not satisfied to call such people
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:56.620]   Christians. Christianity is based on facts. It starts with facts. This is an historical
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:05.660]   faith and religion. The Christian starts with the facts. Secondly, he believes them because
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:12.980]   they're facts. Whether he understands them or whether he doesn't, whether they fit in
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:17.820]   with his prejudice and with his theories or whether they don't.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.140]   I needn't keep you the case of Paul himself. As I showed you at the beginning, he puts
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.180]   this clearly once and forever. Paul says, you remember in the 26th chapter of this book
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:32.020]   of the Acts, "I verily thought with myself that I should do many things contrary to the
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.180]   name of Jesus of Nazareth." Of course, he thought with himself. He was arguing with
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.780]   himself and going round and round in the circles. He didn't believe in this Jesus. He was an
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.180]   imposter. He was not a Pharisee. He'd never been trained. It was all nonsense. He died.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:50.700]   He wasn't the great deliverer that the Pharisees expected.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:58.260]   What was it that made Saul of Tarsus the apostle bull? The fact. The fact of that face, that
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:05.140]   voice, that person. The facts. Not a feeling, but the fact that confronted him. And he said,
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:15.420]   "This is a fact. I give in." The Christian starts with facts. And though they may smash
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:22.300]   his theories, though they may ridicule his prejudices, though they may make to look ridiculous
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:28.420]   the thing he's always said and the thing he's always been able to prove, he says, "I see
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:41.660]   the fact. I give in. I repent. I've been wrong." That's the second characteristic of belief.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:53.900]   The third is this. Belief. Belief's all the facts about him. You've got to be logical
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:01.100]   to be a Christian. I say you must believe all the facts.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.940]   You look at these Pharisees. You see, the problem with them is that they were relying
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.500]   upon the fact that they were partly white. They did believe in the miraculous. They did
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.020]   believe in spirits and they believed in angels. Yes, but they simply believed the facts that
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:22.660]   they liked and they rejected the others. You can't be a Christian like that. Let me put
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:29.100]   it as bluntly and as simply and as plainly as I can. A Christian is a man who believes
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:37.020]   the facts in this book as they are. He doesn't claim to understand them all, but he believes
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:44.460]   them because they're facts and because they're presented to him in the Revelation. I'm told
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.460]   in this book that he was born of a virgin. I don't understand that, but I believe it
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.740]   because I'm told it. As a matter of fact, I can argue about that with you and I can
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:05.540]   justify my belief in it, but whether I can or not, I believe it because I'm told it.
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:14.380]   I'm told that he worked miracles and I believe it because I'm told it. I have nothing to
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:20.360]   go on apart from what I read in this book. If I cannot believe the evidence and the testimony
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.820]   of these apostles about his miracles, I can't believe their evidence and testimony about
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:34.020]   anything. So I believe that Jesus of Nazareth turned the water into wine. I believe that
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:39.580]   he cleansed the lepers, gave sight to the blind, and raised the dead and calmed the
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:48.020]   storm and sea. I believe it all and I find it no difficulty to do so. Because believing
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:55.340]   in God with whom all things are possible, miracles are not difficult. Indeed, I would
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.660]   go further. I would expect miracles when the Son of God comes on earth and I find them.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.740]   But there is no reason for believing them. I believe them because they confront me. They
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:13.500]   are facts. They are a part of him, the testimony concerning him. And so I believe when I'm
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:22.020]   told that he went deliberately to his death on the cross because he had said, "The Son
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:29.140]   of Man is not come to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:36.700]   for many." He died our death. He has risen again for our justification. He has gone into
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:44.300]   heaven to prepare a place for us. That is the message. The world cannot be bettered.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:49.820]   It is mastered by this darkness, the darkness of the devil and of hell. And there is only
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:57.500]   one light that can set us free from it and show us the way to God. He is the one. He
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:02.900]   doesn't tell you to save yourself. He tells you that he saves you. It isn't his teaching.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:09.580]   It is what he has done. I and I alone am the light. He has taken your nature. He has taken
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.460]   your sin. He has taken your punishment. He has been buried in your grave. He has risen.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:22.020]   He is interceding for you. He, the Christ himself, not slogans, not philosophy, not
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   teaching, not ideas. I and I alone, the person, am the light of the world. Are you following
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:45.540]   him? Are you walking in his light? Are you looking only unto him and resting upon him
[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:57.660]   and his finished work? And are you looking for his blessed, his glorious appearing and
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:07.500]   the final glorious consummation? Thank God we are not left to ourselves. We are not left
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:14.540]   to men, however great and noble and wonderful. God is interested. God loves the world. God
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   has so loved it that he gave his only begotten Son. But whosoever believeth in him should
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:40.460]   not perish, but have everlasting life. Have you got it? Turn to the light. Look to him
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:46.940]   and be ye saved. Amen.
