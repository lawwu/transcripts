[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.080]   Hey everybody, I'm here with the glute guy, Dr. Brett Contreras, who's an expert in all
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   things resistance training. So getting stronger, hypertrophy, and these days he's best known
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   for selective hypertrophy, how to direct muscle growth to particular muscles. And he's called
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.040]   the glute guy because he's developed a lot of movements and he's really the expert in how to
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.340]   build stronger, and if you want, bigger glutes. So today we're going to talk about how to train
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.820]   your legs, everything from your calves all the way up, your quadriceps, your glutes, and your
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.700]   hamstrings. And adductors. And adductors, I was just reminded. Everyone forgets the adductors and
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.740]   today Brett will tell us why you cannot forget to train your adductors and he'll show you how to do
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.000]   that. And we're also going to focus on something that everybody cares a lot about, which is how to
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.560]   get selective hypertrophy of muscles that, at least in your mind, you would like larger. Either because
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.440]   of genetics, right? You were just born with genes, let's say, gave you a shorter muscle belly of, say,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.260]   your hamstrings, that would be me. Whereas you might be glute dominant, that would also be me. Or
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.660]   you might have a hard time activating and growing your glutes, but your hamstrings tend to take over
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.920]   everything or your quads tend to take over everything. Today's discussion is also relevant
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.100]   if you happen to have an injury of any kind, which has had you favor certain muscle groups or created
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.940]   asymmetries in your body. For instance, I would say I have a pretty decent calf on this side, but you'll
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.180]   notice because of an injury years ago, I have a harder time engaging this calf. So it's smaller.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.480]   And as a consequence, I need to train it differently to bring it back up. Today, we're going to go through
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.580]   a workout that you could apply to any weak points. So even though we're going to focus a bit on bringing up
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.580]   hamstrings and a particular calf in this case, for you, it might be glutes. For many people, it seems to be
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.120]   glutes. For you, it might be adductors. For you, it might be quads. Today's a really incredible opportunity
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   for you to learn from the expert in resistance training, hypertrophy and strength training, how to bring up weak
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.240]   points or body parts that you would like larger. So I'm really excited to do this today. You're the man.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.540]   Whenever someone reaches out, which happens from time to time and says, how can I grow my glutes? I
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.220]   would say, well, there's literally the glute guy. He is a doctor. He's a PhD. He knows everything you
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.020]   need to know about how to do this. And so I'm ready when you are. Let's do it. Am I the only person in
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.940]   the world that does tip raises religiously? You are, but knees over toes guy does. All right. So
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.220]   Andrew here is doing the tip raise. This is great for preventing shin splints and building the front
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.060]   muscle here, the tibialis anterior. Hopefully your gym has one of these. This shouldn't be neglected for
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.400]   overall health and mainly for running, for preventing shin splints. So typically what I do, I mean, you can
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.960]   tell me what I should change, is I'll come in here, throw this weight on, and I'll do maybe 15 or 20 just as a
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.660]   warm up to get some blood in there and to really just focus on engaging the muscle. And I never set
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.260]   the weight down. I'm always trying to get continuous tension. I mean, most people don't do this ever. So
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.580]   you start just doing it a couple of times a week, even with lighter weight, that's so much more than
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.920]   other people do. What's your general take on where to put your mind when you're training? If you're a
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.440]   powerlifter, I think the focus should be on visualizing your deadlift while you're doing like
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.580]   a hip thrust, visualize your deadlift lockout, or while you're doing belt squats, pretend you have
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.280]   a bar on your back and visualize the actual lift you're trying to make it transfer to. Focusing on
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.240]   the muscle and getting an intense mind muscle connection is invaluable. It's a necessity for
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.860]   lifting long-term in my opinion. Yeah. One of the reasons that I don't have mirrors in my gym is for
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.900]   that reason. Like I don't want to be focused on what I look like or anything. I just want to put my
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.660]   mind into the muscle that I'm training. The other thing that I've noticed, and this relates directly
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.940]   to so-called weak body parts, is that if you can contract a muscle really hard without any weight
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.420]   in your hand, you stand a better chance of being able to create hypertrophy for that muscle. So like
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.120]   the idea was, you know, if you can really cramp your bicep to the point where it's like, ah, that actually
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.560]   it not hurts, like you can go, ow, but you know, that it feels like a cramp. Then when you pick up the
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.940]   weight, you're trying to do that using the weight with added resistance. And certain things like my
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.460]   lats, my glutes, my quads, I can flex independently and isolate very easily. Certain muscles, it's
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.700]   harder to do that. My delts, for instance, which have always been a lagging body part. So I think
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.200]   there's real truth to the mind muscle connection as it relates to during the set.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   We did this in the past to grow the soleus, but the recent research is that you can grow
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:50.100]   the soleus from standing calf raises just so this is unnecessary. This is one of the main muscles
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.800]   that has consistently shown that a lengthened bias works better. When you reach failure with
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.320]   full range, you continue with partials just in the lengthened position. Finish off with a big stretch
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.900]   at the bottom, hold it for like five seconds. That's where it burns like crazy. Or just do the
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.720]   bottom range. Would you say you broke this? I broke that left foot three times and I can't
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.560]   contract the gas drop. When you have a market imbalance, there's different strategies. Do two sets
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.600]   for every one set. Do two sets on your left leg for every one set you do on the right leg. You can get
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.440]   equal muscle growth from doing low reps or high reps. In terms of the optimal number of sets per week,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.840]   probably around 10 for most muscle groups. If you really want to specialize, you can do a lot more
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.400]   volume, but you kind of have to take away. So this is a really key point you're making. If I'm going to,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.080]   let's say, try and bring up hamstrings or calves or glutes or chest or whatever it is, and I decide to
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.520]   increase my volume by 50%, something else has to give. Yeah. Instead of trying to grow everything all at once,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.200]   you focus on one muscle at a time, maintain the others, and then alternate them. If you want
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.480]   total body hypertrophy, maybe one month you focus on chest and quads. The next month it's back and
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.200]   hamstrings. The next month it's glutes and adductors. They kind of go together. In theory, it could be
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.080]   better. Okay. So next up, Andrew is going to do the seated leg curl. What's your favorite leg curl?
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:22.360]   Lying leg curl. I like lying leg curls too, but there's one study by Mao. He showed
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.840]   that seated leg curls were more effective at growing the hamstrings than lying leg curls.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.040]   Hamstrings seem to be a muscle that grows best in the stretch position. Not all of them are like that.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.520]   If you're going to pick one leg curl most of the time, do seated, but with caveats. So this is one
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.560]   reason to maintain flexibility. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Try and get into this. It's pretty light. So when you do
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.880]   seated leg curls, what you want to do is make sure right at the top here that you feel it. Some people will
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.320]   like touch down prematurely. You want to get all the way to the top, make sure your butt's touching the
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.000]   pad. Okay. And then you could put something here like pushing you even to more hip flexion. Yeah,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.840]   that's a big stretch. Yeah. Then come down. And then what I like with these, see how your butt's wanting
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.320]   to scoot forward. Stay. Yep. Okay. Come, come back. If Andrew's focusing on hamstrings this month,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.600]   trying to really prioritize his hamstrings, then we want to use the biggest thing is to try to use
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.280]   progressive overload. It doesn't have to be the most weight you've ever lived. It just means
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:30.200]   you start out. And if, if we had, we have a 45, say we had a 45 and a 25, and you can get 12, 10, 8 on that.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.000]   Then the next week you get 12, 10, 10. Then by week four, you're getting 12, 12, 12. That's progressive
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.600]   overload. It works well for a short stints. Then you hit a wall, but if you're always cycling around
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.360]   this whole premise of rotating your focus point, then it works really well that way. It's hard to
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.200]   emphasize to people just how, how stretched it feels. It feels like I'm trying to reach and touch under the
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.360]   arches of my feet from a standing position. You're doing weighted stretching here. That feels really
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.880]   good. Next up, we got the stiff leg deadlift. So I'm going to have Andrew get in position. First rep will
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.280]   be a conventional deadlift, a normal deadlift, deadlift the weight up. Then you organize yourself and get
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.560]   focused from the top. Basically put the bar at mid, like bisecting your shoe. So it's a couple inches
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:19.960]   off the shin, a little forward, a little more right there. I'd get a narrower stance. Okay. Now bend over and
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.880]   grab the bar. So you do three things at once. Slightly drop the hips, arch the back, and kind of pull the
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   armpits towards your pockets, and then keep that neck. Some people say look up because it activates
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   the erectors more. Some people say look down. Just try to keep it fairly neutral-ish. This feels neutral,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.000]   and then just drag it up. So then your gaze will come up as you rise up, and just make sure the bar
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.800]   skims your legs the whole time through. It doesn't move away from your legs. Okay. I'll try and scratch
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:54.760]   them up your shins. Yep. Great. Keep the legs more straight. Focus more on a hamstring stretch. Yes.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:04.200]   Good. Okay. Yes. Good. Two more. Great. Don't pause at the bottom. You're making it harder. To me,
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.560]   the safest way, and the way that makes most sense for hypertrophy, because when you round, you're actually
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:15.400]   shutting the erectors off a little bit. You're relying on the passive structures. You still produce torque,
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.920]   but it's the stretching of the muscles and the ligaments and things. The muscle activation goes
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:27.000]   down in the erectors. We're referring to spinal erectors. The spine erectors, to hold the arch,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.840]   that's what they do. They erect the spine, keeping them erect. Then what you do is you train the muscles
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:41.640]   at a longer length. If you round over, you're kind of reducing the erector activation. You reduce some of
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.120]   the hip flexion that you go through. Can I ask one question? If people don't have access to a bar
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.960]   for stiff-legged deadlifts or for Romanians, will dumbbells suffice? Okay. I like dumbbells too, because
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   you can kind of like, you don't have to have them straight. You can kind of have them angled a little
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.080]   bit. And then kind of drift a little. Yeah. Great. People love to criticize. They're going to be like, oh my
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:07.880]   good. Your deadlift form was, you don't, as a trainer, you don't pick people apart. You just
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.080]   always compliment. They're not going to like my deadlift form. No, you're going to get,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.480]   we're both popular. We'll get a lot of hate. But the vasties, you've got three of them, medialis,
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.640]   laterals, and then the intermedius underneath. Then there's this muscle, the rectus femoris. It's
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.200]   actually a hip flexor and a knee extensor. It's kind of like a knife-shaped muscle. It's right here. It's the
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.480]   middle there. The rectum gets worked best through single joint knee extension. So these do work your
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.160]   vasties fine, but compound movements work the vasties better. But the compound movements do not work the
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.800]   rectus femoris as much. So you do leg extensions, especially for the rectus femoris, but studies
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.240]   show that you get more results with the rectum leaning back. Rectus femoris looks cool when you're
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.480]   leaning. All the muscles look cool. So you should do leg extensions because also they don't beat you up
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.600]   like the compounds do. It adds more maximum recoverable volume, but also works the rectum.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.760]   But when you do these, make them the best for the rectum and lean back if you can.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:11.160]   I go like, you know, three sets of 10 to 20. I go higher reps on these. 20 reps? 20 reps is cardio.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.440]   You go so slow and everything. Try to be a little more explosive here because
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.920]   you're not trying to work the squeeze so much. Okay, so I'm just going to get it. We're going to get
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.120]   a groove here. We'll go for like 10 reps. So don't fight it maximally. Just get in a groove. Okay?
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.360]   One. Okay. Okay, that was two. I'm going to pick up. Three.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.440]   Four. Five.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:43.160]   Six. I know you don't like going. Let's just do 10. That's fine. Three more.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.360]   Eight. Two more.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:52.040]   Nine. Last one. Okay. Fight me. Good. Fight me. Good.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.920]   Okay. Now hold it. Five seconds. One, two, three, four, five. Good.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:07.720]   So when you do it that way and leaning back, some people will actually say, I felt it more in the
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.200]   rack fem. I actually, for the first time, actually felt it not just in here, but up in here. I feel it
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:18.520]   here and here. Yeah. Both places. But if you felt it up higher, that's... Oh, yeah. Normally I wouldn't
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.800]   feel it there. I think normally I would just feel it right in the teardrop-shaped muscle. So again,
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:31.960]   you do this this way because it is the way to bias the rack fem and it's a cool-looking muscle when you
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:39.160]   get lean. If you're training yourself and you did want to accentuate the eccentric, you could go two up,
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.640]   one down. We go up with two legs. Oh, yeah. Down with one leg, which this is too heavy to do.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.320]   So next up, we've got the belt squat. Here's what I'll say about the belt squat. I love to see more
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:57.320]   powerlifters using this now because it transfers well to the squat. I always noticed when I was
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.880]   hammering belt squats, it trains your quads in a fashion very similar to squats,
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.280]   but it does not beat you up. You get significantly reduced spinal loading. So you can add what I like to
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:15.880]   say penalty-free volume. It increases your maximum recoverable volume. For quads, it is top-notch.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.000]   Well, should I say for vasties, it's top-notch. It doesn't work the rectus femoris much, but here's
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.720]   what's cool about this. One study showed you don't get as much glute and adductor growth... You don't
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.800]   get as much glute and adductor growth with belt squats than you do with back squats. With the barbell,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.680]   it has you use a little more posterior chains. So this is a way to isolate the vasties a little more,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   but don't feel the need to go as to grasp.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080]   Yeah. You're going below parallel.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:54.760]   I guess I do pause at the bottom. Yeah. And that makes it harder with the weight you're using.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.520]   People overemphasize, but I would say bring the feet in just a little closer.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.040]   Okay. And then flare the knees out a little more as you come down
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.520]   so that they're tracking over the toes. So like right there. And it just feels weird at the moment
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.920]   because it's a new neural groove, but that's the way you teach it. And then over time, you can stray from that.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:18.280]   Yeah. Okay. Let's rack it. If you want to experiment a little more,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.000]   let's go a little narrower stance. So this is going to be more of a quads and stay more upright.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.640]   Okay. So back straight up and down. Back straighter and then let the knees jut forward.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.800]   Push with my toes. Yep.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:39.480]   Deep, deep, deep. Yep. So everyone, when they do belt squats, it's fun to play the ego game.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.840]   If I had you put it on the very last one and did you stand at the very back and sit back when you
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.240]   do it, it makes it so much easier. You'd use 10 plates probably. Okay. Good.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.920]   To be honest, I would rather use less weight and get more out of it. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.760]   I was going to say, cause then where am I going to go? Eight plates, nine plates, 10 plates.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.840]   So, you know, the idea for me would be to use the least amount of weight to still feel like I'm
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.360]   training hard. No. So that's this way. Like, yeah. Oh no, this is brutal.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.520]   It'll stay more upright and go deep as hell. And then, but your way is also good too. You don't,
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.000]   you don't want all your sets to have your knees going way past the toes. Sometimes that can lead
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.560]   to more stress on the patella. So sometimes, so I would say alternate between the two.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.760]   How many sets and reps would you recommend? Let's say I warm up and I'm, I'm training alone and I do,
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.960]   and I do, um, let's say two or three really hard sets of leg extensions. So pre-exhaust and come over
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.320]   here and I do maybe one or two warmups to get the form right. Yeah. I do three and three. Okay.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.400]   Um, you, you could do four, but then it's like, you want to train your hamstrings too.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.280]   I do think you should start doing glutes and adductors, but yeah. What would you suggest
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.440]   for adductors? I'll show you, we're going to do an adductor exercise, but, um, but the adductors look
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.640]   awesome. That's the most slept on muscle there is with men. Um, but the thing is when you do deep,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:09.160]   not belt squats or hack squats, as much as back squats and leg press, you can make those very hip
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.440]   dominant. The, the pendulum squat, the hack squat, the belt squat, these are ways to make it more knee
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.560]   dominant, but the, the hip dominant compound movements like leg press with your feet higher.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.520]   But even I would say even like leg press in a quad dominant fashion, look at bodybuilders.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.760]   They have huge adductors. They don't do the seated hip adduction machine. They squat deep. They do.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.400]   Well, I wouldn't say they barbell squat deep. They do leg press deep or sumo is the best way to work
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.000]   your adductors. Plotkin 2023 compared squats to hip thrusts. And it showed that squats grew the
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.480]   adductors better. They grew the glutes equal, but squats grew the quads and adductors better. Neither
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.040]   grew the hamstrings or glute medius. So squats and hip thrusts don't grow the hamstrings or the glute
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.120]   medius. They grow the glutes equally well, but squats grow the quads and the adductors about
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:06.200]   two and a half times more. If it's like, say, say 4% compared to like 10% or what about goblet squat?
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:12.280]   So if I were hip, you can make them hip dominant. So yeah, belt squats have your vasties covered.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.920]   If you want adductor and glute growth. Yeah. And I think you shouldn't limit yourself and say,
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.440]   I'm ham. I'm, I'm quad, glute dominant. The thing is my damn glutes grow from anything. Like,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:32.200]   like my glutes are going to grow bigger. I'm bigger. So go down like this. Yep. And then kind of think
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.640]   of the seated hip adduction machine. Oh, right. Okay. You're trying to mimic that, but with body weight.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:45.320]   Okay. Okay. Come up, squeeze, come down, feel the stretch. Yep. Back.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   Come down. Yep. My rule of thumb is if someone has not done these, you don't go to failure. You just do one set
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   because tomorrow you'll feel this for some reason, adduction and calf raises tend to get people really
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.760]   sore. If you haven't done it in a while. All right. Okay. Go for it. Make it. Yep.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:24.200]   You're trying to feel it in the stretch. So come down, come down and then squeeze. So you're sitting
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   into it. Okay. See that. So I stretch it, squeeze it. Yep. Gotcha. These are deceptively difficult.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:39.960]   Yeah. We have the optimal leg routine here. If we had done a hip dominant squat, say we'd have done barbell
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:47.160]   squats. Yep. Or leg press, then we might be able to skip on the adductors. But since we did
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.880]   belt squat, we need an adductor movement. We don't have a seated hip adduction machine. So we're going
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.120]   to try and do it with barbell. Yeah. You know, it's going to be your fault that my jeans don't fit
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:04.440]   tomorrow. All right. Okay. There we go. Now I feel it. Now I feel it. Turn out. Yep. So it's almost
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:12.840]   like you want to like kick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good too. Okay. Yep. Ah, yeah. Don't go to failure.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.680]   You'll be so sore tomorrow. Good. Now I feel it. Yeah. Okay. I'd be done.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:25.240]   And you kind of feel yourself release here a little bit and kind of, yeah, get that stretch.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:33.480]   Good. So this is just a Copenhagen variation. And it's, I like having the whole shin on the bench because it
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.320]   it's easier on the knees. Yeah. You might feel that tomorrow. Cool. Yeah. Okay. Two more exercises.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:45.240]   Great. Thank you. Two more. So we got, we got calves and tibialis out of the way. Yep. We got
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.680]   hamstrings. We got quads. We got adductors. Now we just have glutes. Great. Okay. But my glutes are
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:59.240]   already smoked. Okay. So as a trainer, when someone learns the hip thrust, I tend to have you just get to
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.960]   the top position. So what does this do? This is going to work the glutes. Okay. Now you could say what the research
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   says about glutes is you can grow the glutes equally as effectively doing squats or hip thrusts.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:16.280]   So if you squatted hard, the belt squat is a knee dominant squat. If you did back squats,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.240]   you could have, you could have checked off glutes and hamstrings, but you didn't. You did belt squats,
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.480]   which were more vasties. That's why we added in the adductor exercise. And that's why we're adding in hip
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.400]   thrusts. When people get back pain with hip thrusts, it's usually because they hyperextend,
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.440]   meaning like this. I feel that. So this might be your starting point. If you were going to start hip
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.840]   thrusts, I always teach people body weight first, tap down, come up, push tall, push tall with your glutes.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   Okay. Come down, tap, push tall. Boom. Come down, tap, come up tall. Boom. That was a good, yes.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:04.520]   So those last pulses are brutal. So what happens when people start hip thrusting? Good job. They're
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:10.440]   strong in a flexed position. That doesn't mean they're strong in an extended position. So I definitely feel
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:17.800]   it really well in the glute ham insertion too. And then when you strengthen this, think about when you
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:24.760]   run. When you run, you touch down about here and then your center mass passes over the body. That
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:32.920]   running is associated with more hip neutral postures. And the research on hip thrusts versus squats for
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:39.000]   sprinting, hip thrusts appear to be superior for sprinting speed compared to squats. The research
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.760]   on horizontal versus vertical plyos is the same. Well, let me ask you this. Horizontal plyos tend to be
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.480]   better for sprint speed than vertical plyos. And it's because there's this element of
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.960]   foot touching down. Like your ground contact is your window to really influence whether you accelerate,
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:05.080]   decelerate or maintain. So when your foot touches down, you need to have that angle specific strength
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.120]   and power to propel you forward. I mean, it's good for function. It's good for gait. It's good for,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.040]   but people will start telling me I'm, I'm taking longer strides. I feel my glutes working more when I,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:22.600]   when I run, I think it's good for longer distances too. Like not just sprinting, like for, it's just
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.080]   good to do for function. So. Well, that was awesome. Well, one more. We got a glute medius.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:34.200]   One more. So the glute medius is on the side here. It's this strip right here, but it's actually kind
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.600]   of broad. So you've got like anterior, middle and posterior division to it. I think most women should
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.920]   focus on the posterior division of the glute med because that will give them the shelf more. What they
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   want though, like the, the, the, the, the shelf from the side view. What we know is that, uh,
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.880]   squats and hip thrusts don't build the glute medius at all. That was shown in plotkin 2023.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.440]   When you start training your hips, all the muscles in the hips, we should probably have done a hip
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.200]   flexion movement too. Like a single leg, straight leg sit up, for example, off of a bench with the
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.800]   kettlebell on the ground to work the hip flexors in a lengthened position. You're shifting into it,
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.000]   feel the stretch and then shift away from it. Boom. So it's like this.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.840]   And then we can put a plate right here. You can put a plate right there.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:36.120]   Boom. Get out. Separate those legs. So shift, pop, shift, pop. Yes. That's it. Shift, pop,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.480]   shift, stretch it, squeeze it. You're trying to tilt laterally this way. And then at the top,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.640]   tilt ladder that way. That's all glute med. Boom. Yep.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:01.560]   That feels lit up here and here like nobody's business. All right. Well, Brett, thank you so
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.880]   much for taking me through a proper leg workout, tibs, calves, hamstrings with multiple movements,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:16.600]   quads, glutes, and adductors and adductors. I really appreciate the clarity of your explanations,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:21.880]   how detailed you are, when details matter without clouding everything with excessive detail. You're
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.800]   focused on what works in the gym, what's worked for your clients in essentially every single client
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.000]   that you've posted has gotten spectacular results. And not all of them started from a genetically gifted
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.720]   place. In fact, many of them didn't. And it's just spectacular to see. Obviously you walk the walk. I'm
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:44.360]   definitely feeling it from the ankles all the way up to my lower abs from what we did today. But I feel
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:51.000]   also fresh. I feel like I could certainly come back. And for me, I'm a kind of slow, slow recover. So
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.600]   probably in four or five days and hit them again, I probably couldn't resist putting on a little bit
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:03.240]   more weight. But I have to say that it was really the attention to contracting the muscles of interest
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.000]   throughout the movement, stretching when it was needed, contracting when it was needed,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.800]   that for me basically made me aware of muscles that I didn't even know that I had. I knew they were
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.640]   there, but I didn't, I hadn't felt them work like I did today. So once again, thank you so much for the
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.840]   explanation. I feel like I've been gifted an incredible tutorial today that I'm going to carry forward
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:28.440]   for my next 50 years of resistance training. And also everybody, you'll want to check out the full
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.400]   length Huberman lab podcast that I did with Dr. Brett Contreras about basically everything we
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:38.600]   talked about today and much more. There are a ton of practical tools in there. We discuss the underlying
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:44.520]   science. We talk about how to select and build a routine that's customized for your specific needs
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.920]   at different stages of your life, depending on whether or not you want hypertrophy, strength,
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.680]   a combination of both, whether or not you're trying to grow your glutes more. After all,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.920]   he is Brett Contreras, Dr. Brett Contreras, the glute guy. And if you're trying to bring up any weak
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:04.600]   or injured or asymmetric body part or body parts, that's the conversation to listen to. And as always,
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.320]   thanks everybody for listening in. And since he's a scientist and I'm a scientist and we're talking
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:26.520]   about training, but it's grounded in real science. Thank you for your interest in science.
