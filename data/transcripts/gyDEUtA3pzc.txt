[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   All right, today I want to talk about focus.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.780]   First however, a quick logistical note.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.520]   You may notice I am not dressed as normal.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.600]   I am in a sweatshirt and producer Jesse is not dressed as normal either and that is because
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.480]   we are recording this right before Halloween and I decided to dress up as producer Jesse
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.460]   for Halloween and producer Jesse dressed up as me.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.560]   If you are new to this channel and just stumbled across this clip and have no idea what we're
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.040]   talking about, good for you, it's all nonsense, you don't need to know.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.680]   All right, let's get back to what we're going to talk about today which is focus.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.320]   Clearly I talk about this a lot, I care about this a lot, I even wrote a whole book about
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.720]   this called Deep Work.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.880]   Put simply, distraction-free concentration is just a powerful, powerful tool.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.320]   It produces quality results quick.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.400]   It's a source of real creativity.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.760]   It's deeply human.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.560]   Focusing however is hard, especially in our current moment of digital distraction.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.800]   Now when I talk about becoming better at focus in my books and on this show, I have a standard
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.680]   what I would call long-term protocols, a standard set of long-term protocols for over time becoming
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.760]   better at focus and making it a part of your life.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.560]   Over the years these protocols have coalesced around four in particular, brain training,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.640]   workload limits, communication reform and distraction moderation, you've heard me talk
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.600]   about all these before.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.560]   But someone asked me the other day what they could do to get better at focus quickly, like
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   get some improvements right away, tomorrow, the day after.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.760]   I think this is a great question.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.120]   You can't become an expert focuser and have your whole life built around focus overnight,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   but you can get better at it overnight.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.740]   And I think having improvements quickly could be an important source of motivation for people
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.880]   looking to make longer-term changes.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   So I love this idea of what can we do to get better at this key skill right away.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.200]   So I came up with five protocols for short-term improvements to your focus, meaning these
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.160]   protocols work right away, you get immediate benefits from.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.920]   All right, so let's get into this.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   Protocol number one, clearly differentiate your focus blocks.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   So when you are working, you have to imagine there's a bit, 01.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.200]   When it's turned on, you're doing something that requires focus.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.040]   When it's turned off, you're not.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.040]   And you just have a simple set of rules for how you treat focus work.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.280]   The key rules being no distraction, no email, no Slack, no phone, no web browser.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   Having a clear differentiation will right away make a big difference.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.640]   When you try to integrate focused activities with other things you're doing, you're going
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.080]   to be more distracted.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.600]   If you are saying, for example, yeah, I'll just check my email a certain amount of times
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.080]   today to keep up with it, and you're working on something kind of hard, you haven't clearly
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.840]   segregated that focused work from other things, you're going to have this constant fight with
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   your own mind.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   Well, should we check email now?
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.080]   What about now?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   What about now?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.440]   Shouldn't we check in to see what they're saying on John Boy about the Yankees loss
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   last night?
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   Well, this would be a good time to do that.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.600]   Why not, right?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   When you have clearly differentiated focus blocks, you don't have to have these arguments.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.320]   The only argument you have is, do I respect the focus block rule or not?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.280]   So it's a simple thing, but just differentiating for this specific amount of time, which I
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.560]   have clearly specified, 9 to 1030, 11 to 1145, for this specific, clearly specified duration
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.780]   of time, I'm using my focus rules.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.200]   That simple change really helps you get more out of those focus blocks.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.880]   Protocol number two, focus less.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.840]   Here's the thing, focus is great, but if you get too ambitious, like, yeah, I want my life
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.520]   to be like the writer Robert Caro, and I'm just going to spend eight hours a day slowly
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   turning pages in an archive and writing on a typewriter.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.400]   If you get overly ambitious, you're setting yourself up to fail.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.080]   When you fail, your mind can give up on the whole project.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.160]   Hey, we tried this focus thing.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   That's not for us.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.560]   When you have an overly ambitious plan, you might also suffer from your mind realizing
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.060]   your plan is overly ambitious.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.560]   This is not sustainable.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520]   We're not going to be able to focus for six hours today, and if we have six hours free
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.120]   today, we're not going to have that free tomorrow.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.440]   So why begin?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.840]   Your brain is a plan evaluation machine, and when it doesn't trust your plan, it withholds
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.160]   motivation.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.860]   So it sounds counterintuitive, but for a lot of people who are new to focusing, being less
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.040]   ambitious is going to help you in the long term.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.080]   Hey, I just want to do an hour.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.080]   I want to get an hour done every day.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   That seems very tractable.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.440]   Your mind says, I believe this can work.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.720]   You're likely to succeed at it.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.440]   It builds.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.160]   I was looking at a book the other day, reading this book called Lost in Thought, and it had
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   some quotes.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.760]   The author, I think her name is Zena Hertz, had some quotes early on from two books I
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.520]   know well, but I forgot these calculations in the books.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   So she talked about, oh God, what's the book called?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:33.480]   I think it's called The Intellectual Life, written by a Dominican friar, I'm saying his
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   name wrong.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.080]   Anyways, I quote this in Deep Work.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.200]   It's a book from a while back about how to have an intellectual life, and maybe look
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.160]   that up just to see if it's The Intellectual Life.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.640]   Supposedly according to Zena Hertz, in this book, I missed this part, the author says,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.600]   yeah, your goal should be like an hour a day.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   You can dedicate an hour a day to really focusing on books and thinking, you'll have an intellectual
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.120]   life.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.320]   The other book she mentions is How to Live on 24 Hours a Day by Arnold Bennett, a book
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.000]   of which I have a first edition from the early 20th century, a listener sent it to me.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.120]   Supposedly in there, Bennett's argument for what you need to have an intellectual life
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.220]   is, he said, you should aim for 90 minutes a day.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.800]   That should be enough, but three days a week, maybe a little more.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   Anyways, they had formulas for this, formulas for how much time you need to focus to build
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.640]   up an intellectual life.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.200]   The key point being, these times weren't big.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   Is it The Intellectual Life?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.960]   Yeah, by Sir Chalanges.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.640]   Yeah, so I always pronounce that name wrong.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640]   What does it say?
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.840]   It's hard to find what the original copy is from.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   I'll check it out.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Yeah, it's new editions.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.520]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.080]   It was, not to go on an aside here, I'll do this briefly.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   1992?
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.360]   That's a newer edition probably, I think.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.200]   I had a cool version of it.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.860]   I had stumbled across it early in my career at Georgetown in the library stacks, just
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.200]   like wandering through the stacks and I found it.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.840]   I read it, for those who know Georgetown, there's like a patio outside of the Levy Center
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   that overlooks, you have like the business school to your right and overlooks down to
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520]   the football field.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.900]   I remember reading this outside and taking notes on it and then it helped shape my thinking
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.900]   around Deep Work.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   It's a cool book.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.900]   The Intellectual Life.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.900]   1921.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.900]   1921.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   1921 edition of this book from the library.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.700]   It was very inspirational to me at the time.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.500]   I mean, I was like a first-year professor.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.940]   Such a good book to find.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.800]   It was all about the mechanics of how to be an intellectual, and sometimes Deep Work is
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.060]   inspired by that.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.100]   Deep Work is not about how to become an intellectual, but how to become a deep worker, but it's
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   very similar.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   Like how do you craft a life built around your mind?
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.400]   So that was a very influential find for me.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.740]   All right, enough digression.
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.780]   Result number three, use a focus space.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.380]   Have a different place to go to do focus work.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.740]   I don't care what it is.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.380]   Just make it different.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.100]   Kitchen table if you're working from home.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.580]   Conference room.
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.140]   Reserve a conference room at your office.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.020]   You know, the ones you can reserve when you have to do Zoom meetings or whatever.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:11.120]   Reserve those just like an hour at a time for a focus block every day.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.900]   Going to a different space makes it much easier to focus.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.860]   Now, if you really want this to work, don't bring your phone.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.020]   Right now people are sort of getting the DTs a little bit.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   Don't bring your phone.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.860]   And if you're working on your laptop, deactivate Wi-Fi when you go in there.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.300]   Now we're really cooking.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.360]   You're in like a conference room or you're outside on your patio or a kitchen table.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.600]   You have no internet connection.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.260]   It's just an hour.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.720]   Right away you're going to get a big hit to your ability to focus.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.900]   Protocol number four, produce artifacts.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.780]   What I mean by this is especially if you're new to focus, you do not want to just say
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.940]   for this block, I'm going to think.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.300]   There's going to be me alone with my thoughts.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.660]   Like I'm used to doing that now, but I've been doing this professionally for a couple
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.660]   of decades.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.860]   For most people, it's difficult to maintain focus.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.140]   Your mind wanders.
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.980]   It could be frustrating.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:10.860]   So I recommend you should be producing some sort of tangible artifact as you go of your
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   focus section.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.140]   Typically, this is something you're writing.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.740]   You're writing and shaping notes about your thoughts and then refining those notes.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.800]   When I would work on math proofs, for example, during deep work sessions, I had a notebook
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.680]   and I'd be working through my thoughts.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   What about this proof?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   This equation doesn't work.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.260]   Let me label where this equation breaks.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   What about this?
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.260]   Let me analyze this.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.060]   Okay, let me now, this proof strategy failed.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.100]   Let me say where.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.720]   When you're leaving an artifact like this, it focuses your thinking.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.460]   It gives you a scaffolding for your thinking, which makes it much easier to proceed.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.020]   It helps you sidestep a pernicious effect that we don't even know that's happening when
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.740]   we're trying to do intellectual work, which is our mind likes to save energy.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:04.300]   So often, it'll be sort of near an intuition or insight and you begin to get that biochemical
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.980]   feeling of aha, like, "Oh, I'm kind of on to something."
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.660]   But your mind doesn't actually fully articulate that insight.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.940]   It just gets close enough to it.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.220]   I think we're near to something good that you get that good feeling and you sort of
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:22.100]   move on feeling like, "I did good thinking," but you didn't actually finish that insight
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.740]   and pull it through to a completed thought, which can actually take a lot more work after
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.180]   the fact that you already feel like you're on to something.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.180]   When you're taking notes, you have these physical artifacts, it forces you to write it all out.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.220]   This would happen a lot with me when I was working on a proof or like an algorithm analysis.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.860]   I'd be like, "Oh, I think that works," but then I'd have to force myself to write out
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.420]   why it works and do the math.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.780]   And a lot of times I feel, I discover like, "Oh, I didn't really have that right."
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:51.180]   Or this insight, it seems good, but I actually don't know how to apply it yet and here's
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.820]   where I'm stuck.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.660]   And there's always resistance to do that, but that's what actually helps you.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.840]   I think of it as like the head of your thought is poked above the ground.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.780]   You have to pull the whole thing out of the ground.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.420]   You have to harvest the thought before you can, in this metaphor, I guess, cook it and
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.460]   eat it if this is like a vegetable or something.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.060]   And create an artifact as you go along really helps you do that.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.980]   So it gives you structure to your thinking and it helps you finish out your thoughts.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.220]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.720]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.180]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.620]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.980]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.780]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.780]   Check it out.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.900]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.300]   All right, protocol number five, walk.
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.580]   We are good by we, I mean humans, at thinking while we walk.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.060]   Now this might be because we have a long evolutionary history of covering great distances walking.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.440]   We're bipedal.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.620]   We can't, we're not meant to sprint for short distances and then rest like an antelope would.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.620]   We're not meant to stay relatively stationary in one place and occasionally moving.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.820]   We are made to be very efficiently to be able to walk.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.560]   We can walk all day long.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:25.220]   We can walk in the heat of the African savannas where our evolutionary past comes back from.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.380]   We're not heavily furred.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.420]   We can sweat to change our temperature.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.060]   Our hips are set up in a way that has a very efficient bipedal locomotion.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.960]   We're a walking animal, so I think it makes sense that we're very good at thinking while
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   we're walking.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.980]   I also think there's an argument to be made for walking suppresses certain circuits just
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:49.180]   because it gets your mind, automatic portions of your mind working on the taking the steps,
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.940]   which sort of suppresses some circuits in your brain and actually frees you from sort
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.060]   of random brain distraction.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.740]   I can always think through a thought much more clearly walking than sitting still.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:03.460]   There's also probably something about the sensory experience.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.540]   When your brain is seeing novel sensory scenes, you're in the woods, it's a tree, look at
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.460]   this bush, it's really bright and it contrasts nicely with the stream over here.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.500]   That novelty opens up brain circuits, which allows for more creative insight.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.620]   Whereas if you're just at your same desk, you always work, there is nothing novel.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.020]   You might entrench in sort of the same circuits and have a harder time being creative.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.660]   So it's an easy thing to do.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.940]   Say, okay, I'm going to work for an hour and a half on something focused, spend the first
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.720]   half hour thinking about it walking.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.940]   Right away you're going to feel smarter, you're going to have better thoughts, you're going
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.300]   to enjoy the experience more.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.140]   All right, so those are my five protocols.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.340]   Let me go through them again.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.540]   Clearly differentiate your focus blocks from non-focus blocks.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.620]   Focus less.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.700]   Use focus space.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.500]   Use artifacts along the way.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.740]   And spend more time walking.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.060]   There we go, Jesse.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.260]   I don't know why I call them protocols this time.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.380]   I often use that term because I'm a computer scientist, but also Andrew Huberman uses that
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.580]   term.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:13.180]   So maybe that means we'll get 2 million views on this video.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:18.900]   When you were at MIT, you talked about how there were the all-star brains who just were
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.100]   like above and beyond everything.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.300]   Do they do this type of stuff or do they just not need to as they're kind of like professional
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.740]   athletes who are just so elite can eat whatever they want and still be fine?
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.020]   No, it's a good question.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.380]   They would do a lot of this stuff.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.140]   I mean, they were sitting still thinking, there was a lot of that, but there was a lot
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.740]   of motion in thinking.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:43.540]   So there's a mentor of mine, a professor from EPFL in Switzerland, shout out to Rashid.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.160]   He was a visiting professor at MIT kind of early on in my career.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.780]   He was really big on runs.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.160]   So he did his best thinking running because the motion sort of just helped him think.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.140]   The problem was he was in much better shape than I was.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.120]   So he'd be like, yeah, let's go for a run and we can like work on this proof.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.260]   But that'd be too far away.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.420]   Seven miles, like a fast pace.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:17.660]   He'd be like, yeah, the key is you should be running fast enough to talk but not sing.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.420]   And I was like, I can't breathe.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.780]   What about not being able to breathe?
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.780]   That's where I am right now.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.580]   So that's the problem with running.
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.860]   So I think for him, for someone who's in really good shape, to them, a slow jog is like a
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.860]   walk to other people.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.500]   Like, it's not really taxing you, but man, I don't know how many insights I got out of
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   those runs.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.620]   But yeah, no, I saw a lot of that.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.820]   Definitely people had very specific ways they took notes on like how they built out notes
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   on what they were working on.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.980]   I think that was a big thing as well.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.660]   Do your current students ask you about this a lot?
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:55.060]   No, but I am talking about it soon.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.660]   So we have this new class at Georgetown for the graduate students called research methodologies.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.980]   And it's a class where it's like just learning how to be like a researcher.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.500]   And I'm giving a talk to this class and I'm gonna talk about these things.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.380]   So we should talk about these things more at MIT, it was just assumed it was so sink
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.380]   or swim.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.640]   It was like, yeah, you better figure this stuff out because otherwise you're out.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.420]   And so people were like highly and I would learn from mentors like the one I just talked
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.340]   about who these weren't students, these were professors.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.940]   They taught me all these rules about, okay, here's how you work on a problem.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.220]   Like I learned from Rashid, for example, in theory problems.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.860]   You start with the simplest possible formulation of the problem.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.260]   We will call it a toy version.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.300]   So like you've simplified a lot of the complexities.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:47.500]   You've made the model very simple and something that just gets to like the core of the thing
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   that you're interested in.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:54.300]   It's like solve the toy problem, understand the toy problem and then you can add back
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   complexities.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.300]   Okay.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.240]   Now that I have this insight, what happens when we make the model more standard or we
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.820]   add other things to it and you end up with something that's kind of complicated and contingent,
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.140]   but it's like starting with the core problem.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:13.020]   Like for example, I worked on this paper with him way back when, I think the title, if you
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.020]   want to look this up, theoretical computer scientists out there, I think the title of
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.100]   the paper was on malicious moats and suspicious sensors.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.300]   And it was a paper about trying to communicate wirelessly in like an abstract model.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:32.020]   When you had maybe like a malicious source nearby that could be trying to, it could like
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.860]   jam your signal or try to trick the receiver into thinking something else was going on.
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:42.380]   Like how do you communicate securely on a shared channel, right?
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.380]   And he simplified it.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   I remember this.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.420]   We simplified it down to like, let's just start with time is in rounds.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:55.420]   My entire goal is there's two, there's a sender and receiver, Alice and Bob, and Alice has
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   a single bit.
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.900]   It's either zero or one.
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.980]   And Alice just wants Bob to figure out, is her bit zero or one?
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.780]   And we'll make time and like exact rounds.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.340]   And in every round, like Alice can send something or not.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.820]   And in every round, there's one adversary, we'll call it Charlie, can also send something
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   or not.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.820]   And if they both send something, it's, they kind of like collide.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.820]   Like you just detect noise.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.100]   Like we simplified it as much as possible.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:31.300]   And this really like deep insight about the amount of communication required to jam communication,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.340]   this jamming game, this like whole like really deep insight came out of looking at the simplest
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.500]   possible problem.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.700]   And then like a lot of papers have been written on this or whatever.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:44.460]   But yeah, I guess the point being, how you think matters.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.740]   Not just like how you focus, but how you approach problems, how you approach articles, how you
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.740]   approach books.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.180]   A lot of this information is often implicit and not made explicit and you kind of just
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.980]   have to figure it out and other people's don't.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.340]   So I really love efforts to try to surface thinking.
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.580]   Like I have this idea for a short book I want to write at some point called In Defense of
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.460]   Thinking, like a manifesto.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.140]   And really get into thinking as a skill and there's all of these like skills and different
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.140]   types of thinking.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.260]   There's different ways to do it as this whole like lively, rich, actual activity.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.380]   And not like we think about it now, it's just this like vague thing.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.180]   Like I don't know, I'm just in my head thinking about things.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.820]   So I've spent my life thinking for a living, so I think a lot about thinking.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.180]   All right, well, we got some good questions coming up.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.660]   I should say before we get there, Jesse, I don't know how you wear these sweatshirts
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   all the time.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.660]   They're warm.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.660]   Well, you get really hot.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.100]   I get really cold in the studio.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.100]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.980]   Like right now I'm cold, but you run hot when you, well, you're talking a lot.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.980]   I do.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   I do run hot.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.140]   Like to me, this is what I would wear outside.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.740]   I would say like down to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.460]   I hope you don't faint during this recording.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.020]   I don't know if I'm going to make it.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.020]   Nonsense.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.260]   According to the Arctic, I have the air conditioning blasting too.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.840]   That's why Jesse's cold.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.540]   That's his punishment for making me wear a sweatshirt.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.220]   All right, we got some questions coming up, but first let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:17.060]   I want to talk about our friends at ZocDoc, an app that I just used the other day.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.580]   Let me explain why.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.500]   ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search and compare high quality in-network
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.660]   doctors, choose the right one for your needs, and click instantly to book an appointment.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.420]   We're talking about in-network appointments with more than 100,000 healthcare providers
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.740]   across every specialty, from mental health to dental health, eye care to skin care, and
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.580]   much more.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.780]   You can filter for doctors who take your insurance, who are located nearby, who are a good fit
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.460]   for the needs you have, and look at ratings by real patients, verified real patients.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.460]   Are they good?
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.460]   Are they bad?
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.900]   It really simplifies finding medical care.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   This is hard.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.220]   This is one of these things they don't really teach adults how to do.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.340]   I used ZocDoc the other day because I was looking for a dermatologist.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.660]   Think about this problem.
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.000]   You're a new adult and someone says, "You need a dermatologist, go."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.340]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.780]   I guess I'll just Google dermatologist near me, and you get all these things, and most
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:21.340]   of them aren't taking patients, or if they're taking patients, it's because they're terrible
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.860]   and you have to call them and go through this whole thing on the phone and they don't answer.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.760]   ZocDoc, you just search, nearby, takes my insurance, they have good reviews, great.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.100]   You can often book the appointments right there using the same app.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.100]   Great, let me get this appointment.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.500]   Let me book it.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.540]   It makes this aspect of being an adult much easier.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.300]   Many of ZocDoc appointments you find doing this will happen fast, actually typically
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.980]   within 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:54.180]   You can even sometimes score same-day appointments.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:00.420]   Stop putting off those doctor's appointments and go to ZocDoc.com/deep to find and instantly
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.020]   book a top-rated doctor today.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.980]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:14.320]   You have to say ZocDoc.com three times fast for good luck.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.660]   I'm trying to make that a thing.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.120]   You think I can make that like a trend where people just say ZocDoc.com quickly?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   Probably.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:24.900]   All right, what do we got here?
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.900]   Longtime sponsor of the show, our friends at Grammarly.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:37.140]   I mean, for years, Grammarly has been this go-to tool which you can use basically anywhere
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.140]   you write.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.360]   I have the number here.

[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.940]   some titles for me?
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.620]   Can you write an initial draft of like this request email that I have to send to a marketing
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.620]   executive?"
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.340]   It can help you with tone, "Hey, can we change the tone of this?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.740]   Can you rewrite this more professional?
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.800]   What about more casual?"
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.780]   It can make word suggestions, and it does this in the apps you're already doing with
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:32.500]   enterprise-grade security and a business model that does not sell your data.

[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:51.020]   A couple of stats, 90% of professionals say Grammarly has saved them time in their writing
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   and editing.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:58.120]   Four out of five professionals say Grammarly helped them gain buy-in and action by improving
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.700]   their communication.

[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.180]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.660]   Who do we got first?
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.880]   First question is from Confused.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.080]   You stated no time-blocking outside of work, but my life outside of work is more complex
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   than work itself.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.000]   It's where I'd like to be more productive.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.080]   How should I manage family time, friends, volunteering, and varied commitments, and
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.840]   a side hustle?
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.080]   Well, first, I'll make a clarification in case this is helpful.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.120]   The main thing I want people to avoid is time-blocking all their time.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.160]   If you time-block all of your waking hours, it's too exhausting.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.640]   It's too much to remain in the time-block mindset, and you're going to give up.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.720]   You're also going to stress yourself out.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.120]   Some people are in situations, however, where it's not like a traditional here's my job
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   from 9 to 5, and then I have time off after my job.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.520]   People have unusual situations.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.000]   Maybe they have work that happens in the evening or split-shift work, or they're not working
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.280]   a traditional job, and actually the main thing they're doing is organizing what's going on
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   in their house.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.560]   And a lot of these efforts happen not during the day.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   That's the easy time.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's in the afternoons or evenings.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.920]   This is where I think this more generalized rule helps.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.800]   Your goal is not to time-block all of your time.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.200]   So for some people, this might mean actually earlier in the day is un-time-blocked, but
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.760]   this complicated part of my day, like 3 to 7, I really time-block that because that's
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.360]   what gets complicated.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.520]   The other thing you can do, so let's say you have a 9 to 5 job and you're time-blocking
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.200]   it because you need to do that to keep your job.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.440]   Some other things you can do to help control your life outside of work is, one, make use
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   of your calendar.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:53.080]   So a lot of the things you mentioned, like doing things with friends, you're volunteering,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.360]   some side hustle activities, these probably are happening at set times.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.240]   So that's on your calendar.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   That's fine.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   You look at your calendar.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   What am I doing this evening?
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   OK.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.240]   Here's my events.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.240]   I know when they happen.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.240]   That's fine.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   That's just your calendar.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.040]   That's not time-blocking every minute of your day.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   You can autopilot schedule, regular work, like on a side hustle or hobbies.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.680]   I always do it in this place on these days at this time.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:24.440]   That makes sure this work gets done, but it's not the same as building an ad hoc time-block
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   plan on spec for every evening.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.440]   Knowing that, like Tuesday and Thursdays, you leave work early and you work on your
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.240]   side hustle at the local coffee shop, and that's just your routine, is not the same
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   as time-blocking.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.440]   That's when you always work out, like right after work, before dinner starts.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.400]   That's an autopilot routine.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.340]   It's not the same as time-blocking because it's just something you do.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.520]   It's not you saying, OK, I built this on spec schedule for the next few hours that I have
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   to follow.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   That takes more work.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.220]   Finally, it's OK to sketch a plan for your evening.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:05.100]   Just don't be super minute-by-minute precise, like, OK, before I pick up the kids from baseball,
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:09.240]   I want to try to get this done, and tonight after dinner, remember to take out the garbage
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.240]   and recycle.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.040]   You can just sketch out these plans to help guide you without having to have every minute
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.240]   spoken for.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.480]   Really our principle here is do not time-block your whole day, every waking hour, but there's
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.920]   still a lot of structure you can have.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.680]   You don't have to just have a big to-do list after your workday is over and just rock and
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   roll.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.120]   You can still have a lot more structure than that.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   When they do work on the side hustle and they go to the coffee shop, say, on Tuesdays, they
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.800]   should probably still time-block that, right?
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.960]   So if it's an autopilot schedule, you just know that's when you do it.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.200]   So I see that as different than time-blocking, but you're saying, like, within that block.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   Yeah, within that block.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.320]   I think that's fine because your side hustle is work.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   So I think that's fine.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.460]   If you're like, OK, I have 90 minutes in the coffee shop, what am I doing?
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.780]   If it helps to time-block that out some, I think that's fine.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.780]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.620]   Next question is from Anonymous.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.100]   I'm 25 and live at home.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.820]   I discovered you on YouTube.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.660]   From your guidance, I now schedule times for gaming, no more YouTube browsing, and reading
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.140]   is my main form of entertainment.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:20.060]   I just started taking some more classes online for my bachelors in computer information systems.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.860]   I got your time-block planner, but I have trouble prioritizing what to do.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.740]   There are so many things I want to get done.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.900]   I like this idea that, for more people, we're the last YouTube channel they ever discovered
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.980]   because once they listen to us, they don't browse on YouTube anymore.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.780]   My advice for YouTube is treat it like a library or a cable TV station, right?
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.000]   So look things up that you want to learn more about.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.700]   Have a stable of shows like mine that are bookmarked that you watch the same way that
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.340]   you might have used to watch the Mythbusters on Discovery Channel.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.020]   These are programs I like.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:58.140]   It's funny, not to do an aside, Jesse, but last night we were watching a YouTube video,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.060]   two different YouTube videos, maker YouTube videos, so a Mark Rober video and a Hacksmith
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.820]   video.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.540]   My wife was watching with me and the boys, and what she remarked, which is absolutely
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:17.660]   right, is they are converging on exactly the production style of circa 2000s cable reality
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.420]   TV.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:24.860]   So when you watch some of these videos now, it's just like watching one of these reality
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.900]   shows at 3 o'clock on the Discovery Channel.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:35.240]   The cuts, the talking heads, the kind of forced zaniness, like we're all having fun.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   So it's interesting.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:43.300]   It's like YouTube, the higher funded YouTube is now basically rediscovering classic cable
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.420]   TV, like reality competition program styles.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.620]   Anyways, back to your question.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.620]   All right.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.820]   So here's why I usually recommend the people who are going from unstructured to structured
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.820]   for the first time.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.980]   First of all, congratulations.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.820]   The structured life is much better than the unstructured life.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.900]   It's one of my preparation steps for the deep life more generally.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   We've talked about this before.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.820]   If you want to cultivate a deep life, you have to get your act together first, and this
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.700]   requires practicing and cultivating discipline, organizing all the stuff you have to do in
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.580]   your time, and then I have a third one in there about taking back control of your brain.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.420]   So you're sort of on track to what you need to do to cultivate a deep life.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.420]   Here's what I recommend the people who are new to this, three things.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.520]   Number one, autopilot the things that are most important.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.420]   It sounds like you have a lot of flexibility in your schedule.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.420]   That's great.
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.900]   You don't want to just come to each day and say, "What are the things I want to do today?
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   What's important to me?"
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.580]   You want to autopilot the important.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.700]   For you, that should mean autopiloting your time for your online classes.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.340]   If you autopilot that time, you can attack these classes much more systematically and
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.820]   get through them much faster actually.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.940]   You'd be surprised by how many classes you can complete when it's like every day for
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.380]   90 minutes.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.940]   Typically I tell people who are new to structure to also autopilot fitness or exercise in there
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.380]   and something community-oriented.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.340]   Every week I have this like volunteer thing I do.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.500]   So you get the big rocks to use a Stephen Covey term automatically happening on your
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   schedule.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:13.420]   Next, you want to use multi-scale planning for everything else.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:19.480]   This prevents you from having to grapple moment to moment with the full scope of your ambition.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.580]   So once you realize like I can control my time, and as you say here, there are so many
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.700]   things I want to get done.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.760]   It could be paralyzing when it's 10 o'clock on Tuesday, "Oh my God, which of these things
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.760]   should I do?
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.340]   I'll never get through them all."
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:41.060]   Multi-scale planning cures you of this paralyzation because you don't have to think about everything
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.220]   all the time.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.700]   At the scale of the season or the quarter, you're figuring out your big goals like what
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.260]   do I want to do this fall?
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.020]   Then when you make your weekly plan, you're saying, "Okay, which of these things do I
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.860]   want to make sure are reflected in my weekly plan?"
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.860]   You're moving around appointments, scheduling some stuff on your calendar.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.260]   Then when you get to your day, you have your autopilot schedule, you have the stuff you
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.420]   already had on there in a weekly plan, you're really just time blocking your day.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.420]   You're looking at your task list.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.060]   It's much less fraught.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:15.060]   So use multi-scale planning to, I would say, confine your ambitions so that it's not constantly
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.460]   rattling your brain.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.980]   The third thing, avoid overload.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.100]   It is tempting as you gain more structure in your life to try to fit in a lot of things,
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.740]   to try to catch up all at once.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.080]   You'll burn yourself out this way.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.660]   Keep your schedule reasonable.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:37.140]   Keep seeking out time for gratitude and awe and just straight up enjoyment of things.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.440]   Going to see the sunset, the long walks, going to the concerts.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.100]   That sense of appreciation of life is going to be the fuel to help you keep pushing on
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.800]   making your life more interesting because it's exactly this type of appreciation and
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.040]   gratitude for cool things you're doing that you want more of.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:02.120]   So don't fill all your time with productive activity.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.640]   Balance the productive activity with the enjoyment of the fruits of these efforts.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.520]   All right, who we got next?
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.120]   Next question's from Seb.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.520]   "I work in consulting where there are lots of shallow meetings.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.200]   How can I do deep work to increase my job skills if my days are filled with meetings?"
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   Seb reached out to me.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.600]   He was actually in Asia before, and that's where there was a lot of meetings.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.440]   Then he moved to Germany and the same problem occurred there.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.160]   This was the guy who was saying, but in Asia there was overtime.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   Yes.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   And in Germany there's not.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Right.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   So it's more structured.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   In Asia, it's more structured.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.760]   Like, well, the meetings, you're being compensated for if this gets in the way of other work.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.840]   And Germany's more Western where it's like, nah, hyperactive, I don't mind.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.200]   So Seb, my short-term advice is schedule meetings with yourself.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.400]   So if you're in a meeting-driven job, then just have some meetings on your calendar for
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   deep work.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.520]   Because you have to keep in mind, you're being bombarded with meetings.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.900]   You say yes to a lot of them, you say no to others.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.040]   Some days are more full than others, and you have to move meetings forward to try to find
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   time for them.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.980]   So it's not like you're going to notice a difference if you introduce some new meetings
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.040]   into this mix.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.020]   It's all still going to be you trying to fit meetings into your days, and some days are
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.380]   more full than others.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.420]   No one else is going to notice the difference either.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.140]   But if your mindset is in one of meetings, if that is the fundamental structure of work
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.680]   at your company, you have meetings, we talk about things.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.880]   Your calendar is your destiny.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.320]   Then just put other cool stuff on your calendar.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.000]   So I have this three days a week, 90-minute meeting.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.140]   It's with myself, and it's when I work deeply on this project.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.060]   But I treat it like any other-- it's on my calendar.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.180]   I treat it like any other appointment.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.460]   If we use a shared calendar in our company so that we can see when people are available,
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.300]   that just shows up as a time when I'm busy.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.420]   Don't make a big deal about it.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.780]   Don't preach about it.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:58.500]   But we have this tendency in modern knowledge work to somehow value meetings with other
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.820]   people above the time we spend doing stuff with ourself.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.580]   And this is an inversion of reality.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:12.220]   Meetings are typically supporting the efforts that eventually have to be done on our own
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.860]   through focus.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.820]   So the focus has to be very, very important.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.000]   You can't just talk about the work.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.100]   You have to do it as well.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.700]   So it's this weird value we have about what matters is meeting with other people.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.940]   So schedule meetings with yourself.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.220]   Two, try to reduce meetings.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.860]   I know that's scary in a meeting culture.
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.660]   But there's a few ways to do that.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.580]   One, just say no to more meetings.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.460]   You don't have to say yes just because it comes your way.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.020]   People throw out meeting invites all the time at all sorts of things, especially if they're
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.780]   just like, hey, you might be interested in this.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.220]   We thought you might be interested in this.
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.220]   Why don't you listen in?
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.220]   You're just like, no.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.220]   My calendar's full.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   It's a busy week.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.940]   I've hit my workload limit.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.140]   I'm trying to cut back on it.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.380]   People don't care.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.700]   Two, use office hours.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.740]   So if there's a one-off meeting, like, hey, let's discuss this thing because it's too
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.380]   complicated to do via email, for example, if you just have a set time twice a week,
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:10.280]   you can defer more of those to that set time so it has a much smaller footprint.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.420]   And then use protocol and processes more.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:20.220]   Don't let people, to the extent that this is possible, use standing meetings as a replacement
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.780]   for real process thinking and time management.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.620]   Don't let people say, OK, we're going to work on this project.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.620]   I worry we're not going to make progress.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.620]   So here's what we're going to do.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.700]   I'll put a standing meeting on our calendar so I know at least every week we'll talk about
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.700]   it.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.700]   Now I don't feel stressed.
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.820]   The progress won't make progress.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.580]   That is a weak way to organize work.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.580]   Say, no, no, no.
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.260]   If we're going to work on this project, let's take a moment to figure out how we're going
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.500]   to do it.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   What are the steps?
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   Who's going to do what?
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.540]   How do we find out who needs what from when?
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.900]   Where are we going to keep the information?
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.980]   What are our deadlines for different things to happen?
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.180]   How do we actually want this work to unfold?
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.940]   Not just let's just have a meeting and small talk for 20 minutes and then do five minutes
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.980]   of talking.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:05.360]   Or if you need, say, look, if we just want to check in, come to my office hours once
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   a week.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.420]   Like, hey, how's it going?
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:13.220]   Or say, I'll stop by your office once a week just to poke my head in and be like, hey,
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   how are we doing?
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.220]   Going okay?
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.220]   Okay.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.220]   Any questions you have?
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.860]   Anything that prevents a meeting that takes 30 minutes to an hour squatting there on your
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.000]   schedule is probably going to be an advantage.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.580]   You can cut down on meetings, but then ultimately just make what you do with yourself, your
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.100]   deep work, a meeting as well.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.500]   I've got a lot of meetings in my life these days, Jesse.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   Do you like that?
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   No.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.940]   I want to write and be left alone.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.380]   I use a lot of office hours, though.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.380]   All right.
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.020]   What do we got next?
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.860]   Next question is from Carson.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.820]   What are your all-time favorite books?
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.740]   Oh, well, long-time listeners know I can't do favorites.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:56.320]   Like in any category, movies, books, foods.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   I am incapable.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.860]   It's not like an intentional choice.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.740]   I'm incapable of rank ordering things I like.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.740]   I don't know why.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:10.860]   I think there's probably we could come up with a term about it, like ordinalphobia,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:20.880]   something like that, anti-ordination, therianism, maybe ordinalism, ordinalphobia.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.140]   I just can't do it.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.140]   All right.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.500]   I did, however, in preparation for answering this question, I took a bunch of categories.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   I just looked at my shelf.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.060]   I took a bunch of categories and was like, what's a book that was influential to me in
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.060]   that category?
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   All right.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:40.260]   Now, this is not exhaustive because I was literally just looking at my bookshelf, but
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.260]   I'll give you some ideas.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.260]   All right.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.620]   In religion, a book that was very influential to me was Karen Armstrong's The Case for God.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.020]   This sort of came out during the period of the New Atheist, Richard Dawkins, Christopher
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:39:00.080]   Hitchens, et cetera, and it gives a much more interesting, I guess, presentation of religion
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.260]   and the time in which religion emerged and how it was pre-Enlightenment time and the
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:11.380]   issues that happen when you begin to combine post-Enlightenment understandings of epistemology
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.020]   with the way religion operates.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.020]   Really powerful book.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.420]   Those ideas have affected me.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.620]   They show up again and again in all sorts of theological and religious writing and apologia,
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.500]   but I thought this book was just deep ideas, well-written, very interesting.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.660]   It starts with the cave paintings.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.020]   The book opens with the earliest impulses towards religion.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   It's pretty cool.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   All right.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.620]   When it comes to the arts, Cinema Speculation by Tarantino.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.620]   Fantastic book.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:47.080]   Just in the mind of a movie enthusiast and just how they think about movies and their
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.700]   pieces and their values, very well-written collection of essays.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:58.480]   Sidney Lumet's Making Movies, fantastic book about filmmaking where he uses his own movies.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.820]   He looks at the different aspects of filmmaking and uses his own movies for each to talk about
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:02.820]   his experience.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.820]   History.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.940]   I remember John Adams by David McCullough being very influential when I first read that
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.100]   just because it was the way the narrative momentum and the psychological realism.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   I don't know.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.100]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.740]   I just won the Pulitzer, so look, I'm not the first to say it.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.700]   Lincoln's Virtues by William Lee Miller.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.700]   Weird.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.280]   I'd never read something like that before.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.320]   It's like an ethical biography of Lincoln and it's written in this sort of interesting
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.260]   style.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   Very influential.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   Ideas.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:32.260]   Idea books.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.260]   You Are Not a Gadget by Jaron Lanier.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.260]   That was very influential.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.540]   I mean, just the idea of even the polemic and the single person and the exploring of
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.500]   ideas from different angles and trying to wrap your intellectual arms around the sort
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.620]   of complex emerging phenomenon.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.380]   That was an influential book.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:54.140]   I talk a lot, obviously, about Walden by Thoreau, one of the original big idea books.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.580]   It should be read as an idea book.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.700]   Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.940]   It's like You Are Not a Gadget but without the insane parts.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:08.140]   Postman's a more of a careful thinker than Jaron is, though Jaron's a very fun thinker.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.060]   Top Class of Soulcraft by Matt Crawford, I think it was 2008, maybe 2009.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.180]   That was very influential when I read it.
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:18.960]   It was like a really big idea and it was new and it changed the way you understood things
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.960]   and it was humanist.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.340]   It was a cool book.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.540]   Finally in philosophy, I was very influenced by All Things Shining by Herbert Dreyfus and
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.540]   Sean Dorrance Kelly.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.540]   That's a cool book.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:36.020]   I pull from it some in deep work, but it's worth a read on its own to sort of understand
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:42.300]   our current moment and how we see the world differently, for example, than someone living
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.140]   during the age of the heroic age of the ancient Greeks.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.420]   I thought it was a very fascinating, thought-provoking book.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:53.060]   So I don't know if those are my favorites, but those are all influential books to me
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.160]   in categories.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.620]   So you could do worse than to read any one of those books.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.140]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   We have our corner.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.100]   Ah, Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   Let's hear some theme music.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:19.540]   Jesse, I think we should sell sponsor space on my big white tea mug.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:20.540]   I think you should.
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.540]   Kind of like the patches in MLB.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.500]   Just have like an Element logo right here.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.100]   And the logo on the helmet.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.100]   Yes.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.060]   The Yankees had this Strasse.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   Everyone had it.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.060]   I don't know what Strasse is.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.060]   I don't either.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.340]   But every team had it in the MLB playoffs.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.020]   So in some sense, that's been effective advertising, because we all know it.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.060]   In some sense, it's not, because I have no idea what it is.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.180]   All right, Slow Productivity Corner.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:48.220]   For those who don't know, we like to have one question each week.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.900]   That draws from my most recent book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.900]   Without Burnout.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.820]   If you like this show, you need to buy that book.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.940]   About half of what we deal with is relevant to that book.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.660]   So check that out wherever books are sold.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   All right, Jesse, what is today's Slow Productivity Corner question?
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.660]   It's from Tisha.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.360]   I run a small, high-end consulting firm that experienced a lot of hires this past year.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.380]   They went from four to 14 people.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.740]   I read Slow Productivity and decided to incorporate its principles with the new hires.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.740]   It all worked great.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.660]   However, as a business owner, I'm still stressed and have tons of work.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.700]   How can I apply the principles to myself to ease my burden?
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.100]   Yeah, sometimes it's harder for the owner of the business than the people that works
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.100]   for them.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.980]   So as the owner, you can kind of control what's being given to the people below you.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.260]   You can kind of give them processes and structures that helps.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.100]   But you're the backstop.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.700]   So everything that needs to get done that's not being handled by the other people at the
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.260]   company, like eventually you have to do it.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.400]   You're also the intake.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.580]   So much new things, business development issues that need to be solved, vendors that have
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:52.800]   solutions that come through you.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.060]   So it's like the hardest position.
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.060]   The hardest position.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.780]   The good news is you have plenty of autonomy.
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.420]   The bad news is you have a lot of work.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:07.580]   A couple of things that I think help business owners, separate active projects from waiting
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.580]   projects.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:13.780]   So workload management, you can't say no to most of these things because the things you're
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.480]   working on are just things the business has to do.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.380]   But just be really clear about, I'm only actively working on these three things.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.180]   And once I hit a milestone with one of these, I'll pull something else in.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.700]   So it reduces the number of things around which you're doing active administrative overhead.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.980]   That will help.
[00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.540]   You got to make sure that the people collaborating with you on the work that you're waiting on
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.660]   know that.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.820]   So it could be a vendor.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.760]   So you're the owner of a company.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:42.180]   One of the things you have to do is upgrade your email service and whatever.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:47.320]   Like, I got to talk to the rep from Google Workplace and see if they have a solution
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   for us.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.320]   It could be a pain.
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   And they kind of reach down.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.320]   You're like, yeah, I want to do this.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.460]   But it's not active.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.460]   It's on your list.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.860]   It's like two things away from your active projects.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.280]   Tell that vendor, we're going to work on this.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   It's in waiting status.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.980]   I have two things ahead of it.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.060]   I will email you as soon as this moves to active, and then we'll set up a time to chat.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.060]   Right?
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:11.220]   So when people are trying to set up meetings, for example, or sending you emails about stuff
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.240]   you're waiting on, don't set up the meeting.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.260]   Don't reply with the answers.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.740]   Instead say, look, I'm on this.
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.460]   This is in my waiting queue.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:25.380]   When it gets to my active queue, which I estimate will happen within this time frame, I will
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.260]   reach back out to you, and we'll set this up, and email, and I'll be giving this.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.220]   A lot of my attention will make progress.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.980]   So only working actively on a few number of things at a time is going to make your work
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.140]   seem much less overloaded because you're putting the overhead of everything in the waiting
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.320]   list on pause.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.260]   To separate your job in the different roles and treat it like you have multiple part-time
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   jobs, there's an administrator role of trying to run the company.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.660]   There's a strategy role.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.860]   I'm overseeing the teams and making the decisions about the products and what we're going to
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.820]   go with.
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.100]   And maybe there's a-- I don't know whatever role there'd be.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:09.340]   There's a technical role, making sure that we have the best technology or whatever.
[00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.300]   Treat those as separate jobs with their own task list on their own board.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.460]   You have different times, different days for working on these different roles.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:21.500]   This will prevent the context switching that's going to make you feel more harried.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.380]   When you're working on strategy, you're just working on strategy for that morning, and
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   you don't think about anything else.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.340]   When you're working on administrative stuff, that's all you're doing, and you can really
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.440]   pick up speed and start getting a lot done.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.500]   This also will make delegation easier later because you've divided things into roles,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.180]   and now it's much easier when you hire that COO to say, like, great, this role, I can
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.780]   just move over to you.
[00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:46.180]   It makes it easier to delegate what you're doing.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.660]   Finally, create processes.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.580]   Stuff that happens regularly should have a regular way it happens.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.800]   This type of report we always produce, here is how it works.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   It's like clockwork.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.140]   The draft goes here in this folder.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.780]   I sign off of it digitally by this close of business on this day.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.300]   You send it to the designer who has all the instructions she needs to post it to the client
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.260]   web page or whatever it is.
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:12.900]   Make processes for things that happen regularly so that their footprint on your life and time
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.480]   is very predictable, and they're not just another thing floating.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.080]   You're trying to minimize the active floating things you're trying to juggle and have to
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.860]   trade emails and slack about.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.720]   You're the owner, so you can push for as many processes as you want.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.020]   The only caveat there is make sure that the people involved in the process are involved
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.540]   in the details of the process and feel like they have the ability to suggest changes.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.820]   Without buy-in, people will resist the process.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.940]   With buy-in, that can make your life a lot easier.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.940]   Yes, I want to validate.
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.900]   It could be much harder to be slowly productive as the owner of a business than as an employee
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.420]   of a business or as a solo entrepreneur, but it's still possible.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.060]   You've got plenty of autonomy.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:58.620]   You got to just deploy that to implement the right sort of things.
[00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.220]   I think we have a call this week, right, Jesse?
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   We do.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.220]   All right.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   Let's hear what we got.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.380]   Hey, Cal and Jesse.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:11.020]   Just listened to the Tech Minute segment from this week's show, and I have to say, as someone
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:18.580]   working in ed tech and in analytics, my first inclination when I heard the direction that
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:24.520]   that was going was my first thought was, "Oh, my goodness, in a future with visual headsets
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:30.940]   as the three-window desktop of the future," my first thought was, "The eye tracking that's
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:37.700]   required to make that tech possible will really open up the floodgates for work from remote
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:43.800]   surveillance, and some of the mouse jigglers that we're seeing to give the proxy for useful
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.740]   effort will just essentially skyrocket."
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.620]   Anyway, I was just curious what your thoughts were on that.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.700]   That was immediately where my brain went when you started in on the discussion, and I just
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.700]   wanted to see what your thoughts are.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:49:00.420]   If we're living in a future with glasses on everywhere we go, especially at work, when
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:05.580]   we put on our headsets, what kind of future does that present for us as far as proxy for
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.180]   meaningful effort?
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.180]   Will eye tracking really be useful in that future of work, and what are your thoughts
[00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.180]   as it relates to that?
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.980]   Thanks for the pod, and thanks for all your work.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   Bye.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.980]   All right.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.980]   Well, great question, though.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.980]   First of all, Tech Minute.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.020]   No, no, no.
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.220]   Tech Corner.
[00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.420]   There's a huge difference.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.100]   Tech Minute, that's a whole other thing.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.740]   We call that segment the Tech Corner.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.740]   All right.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.700]   It's a good question.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.740]   It is a concern, not a deep concern, and let me explain why.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:42.500]   When we look at the current trajectory of the virtual screen apparatus, so the visors
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:48.620]   to put the virtual screens into your life, they're taking that screen from your laptop.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:56.900]   As it stands now, if I'm using the immersed visor, which is still in testing, or I'm using
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.060]   Apple Vision Pro to put screens in my real world, or Quest 3 to put screens in my real
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:05.700]   world, the actual things I'm seeing on the screens are just my normal applications running
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:10.740]   on my laptop, so the applications don't know they're being viewed on a visor, right?
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:16.100]   The first iteration of this vision, you're not writing as a company that's writing the
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.940]   software that people are seeing in their virtual world.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.620]   You're not writing this software for the virtual world.
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.300]   It's taking your laptop screen, right?
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.580]   So when these are virtual screens, it's the exact same as just plugging your laptop into
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.620]   an external monitor.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.180]   Microsoft Word doesn't know if you're looking at it on an external monitor or not and doesn't
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.220]   care.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.700]   More broadly, however, going forward, I think this is a critical point.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:47.020]   This is a privacy feature that has to be made crystal clear as physical privacy.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:53.400]   If I am a manufacturer of a visor that can put screens in the world, I need to be very
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.620]   clear is what is my API?
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.140]   Am I exposing to applications things they can access?
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.980]   I think the easiest thing is to say no, just be a display.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.740]   There's no API.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.660]   There's nothing that Microsoft Word can access from the glasses themselves.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.540]   There's no interaction between the software in your computer and the glasses except for
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.800]   display.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.900]   This is not going to be the case for most software because what's going to happen eventually
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.780]   is that people are going to want to actually modify their software to take advantage of
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.720]   the fact that they exist in a virtual space.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:28.260]   We see this in, for example, the Magic Leap demos.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:33.500]   They seem to think that it's important that your Google messages are things you can swipe
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:39.680]   with your hand and sort around as opposed to there's just a screen floating in space
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.500]   and has a web browser on it.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:46.500]   In the future, I guess, more apps might want to actually take advantage of the fact you're
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.500]   in virtual space.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.100]   The privacy here has to be very clear.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:56.660]   What information about my physical state does the applications accessing the device API
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.660]   have?
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:02.260]   Do they have any information about my eyes, eye tracking, location?
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.460]   That's going to have to be very clear.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.260]   Maybe that even has to be regulatory.
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:08.660]   We have time until that's a problem because I think, and I've argued this before, the
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:16.740]   Magic Leap vision of we need special AR apps and it needs to look like Minority Report.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:21.980]   We're throwing things around and it's all visually beautiful and I grab the email and
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.340]   I throw it over there and I swipe things around.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.540]   That is not where we're going to go immediately because no one cares.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.820]   They just want more screens.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:31.900]   I want a bigger screen.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.420]   I got an email on my phone.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   I want to type a response.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.860]   I want a 16-inch screen to do that.
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.780]   I don't want to just look at my phone.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:45.340]   That's going to be the first iteration of this type of lifestyle where we're looking
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.340]   at the virtual screens.
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.740]   So, yeah, down the road, that API privacy has to be clear, but it's not going to be
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:51.740]   the initial problem.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:54.900]   Does that make sense, Jesse?
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.740]   If you think about the glasses, it's just a monitor.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:04.780]   We're not worried about, our monitor doesn't talk to the application.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.640]   The application doesn't care how it's being displayed.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.340]   I think that's the way that this technology is going to be, at least for a while.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.620]   All right.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.120]   Let's see here.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:22.860]   We have a case study, but actually, I'm going to jump past the case study because I'm looking
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:27.980]   at the final segment where we're going to read about the books I read.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:34.620]   I have a sort of long digression on one of the books there, so I will save some time
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.620]   for that.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:40.820]   So, let's jump through the books I read in October, but first, before we do, hear about
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:47.420]   another sponsor and this show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:48.420]   Now here's the thing.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:51.860]   We talk a lot about cultivating a deep life on this show.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:57.000]   One of the key properties of a deep life is you have a good relationship with your own
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   brain.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.820]   We talk about physical health a lot.
[00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:04.920]   We talk about organization a lot, but if you don't have a good relationship with your brain,
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:14.700]   if your brain, for example, is prone to rumination or anxiety or a hedonia, depression, this
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:20.760]   is a big deal in terms of your day-to-day experience of your life and a big obstacle
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.240]   to deep life.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.840]   So if you are struggling with your relationship with your brain, who can help?
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.740]   Professional therapists.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.120]   This is where BetterHelp enters the scene.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.120]   If you're thinking about starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:36.440]   Here's why.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.400]   It's entirely online.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.400]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.600]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist and
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.720]   switch therapists at any time for no additional charge.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:58.240]   This is the easy way to get started with therapy, and if you are, again, have a relationship
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:04.760]   with your mind that you're not happy with, therapy is a great way to begin making progress
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   on that.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:09.000]   So give therapy a try with BetterHelp.

[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.440]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:31.800]   Look, when you think about businesses who are making a splash, we're talking about like
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:37.960]   Thrive Cosmetics or Cotopaxi, you might be thinking about, oh, their products or their
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:44.640]   marketing, but an often overlooked secret is actually the businesses behind the business
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.640]   that make selling simple.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.840]   For millions of businesses, that business is Shopify.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.200]   Nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.540]   It's the home of the number one checkout on the planet, as well as it's a not-so-secret
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:05.520]   secret, ShopPay, the feature that boosts conversions by up to 50%.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.920]   This means way less carts are abandoned, more sales are actually completed.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.000]   So if you're growing your business, if you're trying to sell something online, if you have
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.580]   a new store, Shopify should be a part of what you do.
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:25.400]   We don't currently sell something on this podcast, but if we did, it's a no-brainer.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:31.660]   Shopify, beautiful checkout, beautiful interface, has ShopPay, which makes it much quicker and
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.340]   easier for people to check out.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:40.540]   As soon as we figure out our fantastic product, our competitor, Cotopaxi, actually, someone
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.620]   said they might be able to--
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   Zach.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:48.260]   Zach said he could monogram, put some custom labels on some Cotopaxi stuff.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.260]   All right.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.260]   All right.
[00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.100]   So when we start that business, Shopify will be our friend.
[00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.940]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout that will one day be selling our
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.940]   must-have products.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:06.140]   Sign up for your $1 per month trial period at shopify.com/deep.
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.500]   Type that in all lowercase.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.700]   Go to shopify.com/deep to upgrade your selling today.
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.700]   That's shopify.com/deep.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:18.500]   All right, Jesse, let's do our final segment.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.000]   Oh, man, every time I drink, I think--
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.420]   Every time I drink, I think.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:27.420]   I think logo.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.780]   I'm seeing it on the camera here.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.620]   For people who don't know, who are watching, we use teleprompters.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:38.640]   So I can see in front of me every time I raise my glass.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.500]   You don't speak as a teleprompter, though.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.100]   I don't have any notes on a teleprompter.
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.260]   That's clear.
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.780]   You talk off the cuff all the time.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   We talk off the cuff.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:47.780]   We do live to tape.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.380]   But a teleprompter lets me just see what is currently being recorded.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.620]   So now I see myself.
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:56.860]   But if Jesse cuts the camera to himself, I can see what the current shot is.
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:58:01.200]   And if we're doing iPad drawing, I can see the iPad, what's up on the screen.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:05.740]   So it's basically-- this is showing me the master shot that's actually being recorded.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.260]   All right, so I want to talk about the five books I read in October.
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.460]   I got a little riff on the first one.
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.540]   Beware, I haven't done an intellectual academic riff in a while.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:24.940]   So the first book I read, buckle in, On Settler Colonialism by Adam Kirsch.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:29.600]   All right, so why this book?
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:37.060]   I got interested-- the thing that got me interested in this book was October 8th of last year.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:45.140]   So the day after October 7th, 2023, well before there was, for example, the subsequent war.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:53.500]   In academic circles, there was, in some circles, excitement and celebration of what had happened
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.600]   the day before.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.600]   Now this is worrisome.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:00.380]   It just is like a general heuristic.
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:06.100]   Whenever you are seeing a sort of dehumanization of the Jewish people in particular, whenever
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:12.220]   you hear people start saying about Jews, well, they had it coming, you've got to twitch your
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.740]   antennas a little bit, right?
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.620]   Historically, this has not gone well.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:17.980]   So what is going on?
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:21.820]   What is this reaction coming out of academia?
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.500]   It was intertwined pretty quickly, it was pretty clear with rhetoric with specific terms,
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:32.060]   like settlers and settler colonialism, sort of a lot of Frantz Fanon sort of also being
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:36.940]   channeled as well, which as an aside is actually kind of ironic.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:43.220]   Frantz Fanon was actually a supporter of the Zionist project, a supporter of Israel.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.220]   It's interesting.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:49.460]   He liked the socialist nature of what was going on over there, sort of like an interesting
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.460]   sort of contradiction.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:54.740]   Anyways, a lot of this turned out to be coming from a lot of this rhetoric in that sort of
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.820]   immediate celebration of what happened October 7th was coming from an academic theory known
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.160]   as settler colonialism theory.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:08.460]   So following my own dictates, which is read about the things you're hearing about, try
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.580]   to understand things by books where people have taken time to sit down and think about
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.580]   it.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.460]   You know, I want to write, I want to read a book on this and a book came out this summer
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.540]   by Adam Kirsch and it was called On Settler Colonialism.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.420]   Adam is a poet and literary critic.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.660]   I believe he was the poetry editor, I think for Harper's, I might have that wrong.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.500]   And he wrote this book.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.580]   Let me say as an aside, I love the idea of this style or form of publishing where you
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:39.500]   write a short book that's dealing with something that's like very new, you know, as opposed
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.180]   to I'm going to spend four years and work on this book or whatever.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:46.020]   We should have more of this like smart people that are like, I'm going to turn around a
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.060]   book on this quick.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.100]   I've been thinking a lot about it.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100]   I know about it.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.060]   Let me, so you can get books into the conversation faster.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.940]   So bravo to the publisher and Adam, just in the general sense for doing it.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.340]   So I read his book.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.900]   Let me set this up.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.200]   Kirsch is not a fan of settler colonialism theory, so you got to take that into account
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.020]   when you read this book.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.300]   I do think he does a good job, however, of for most of the book, just trying to give
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.260]   a straightforward, here is what this is.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.260]   Here are the ideas.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.260]   Here's where it came from.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.500]   Here's the key readings and writings.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.060]   And then at the end of the book, he gives more of his own critiques.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:25.700]   I think he was pretty fair, but you have to come from the point of view that the book
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.180]   is not positive about settler colonialism theory.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   Okay.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.460]   So what did I learn?
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:38.300]   Settler colonialism theory rose out of the 90s and was developed in the 2000s.
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:43.940]   It emerged in Australia and then later in American circles.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.780]   It was getting this bigger influence in academic and academic activist circles, but it was
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:55.620]   not as well known to the general public as other theoretical frameworks that picked up
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.220]   more prominence, especially in the 2010s.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:03.560]   Racial and gender theories, I think, were getting more attention.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.320]   People were more familiar with those as theories than they were settler colonialism theory,
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.560]   but it was growing in influence, even if it was quieter.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.400]   So for example, land acknowledgments, right?
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.760]   You're probably used to this if you work in sort of any sort of large organizations or
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.520]   arts organizations where at the beginning of an event, you acknowledge the indigenous
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.880]   peoples on whose, which land you're currently doing the event or the play or the meeting
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880]   or whatever.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.120]   So it actually, as far as I can tell, came out of settler colonialism theory, so it came
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   out of these academic circles.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.080]   So it was having influence, it's just, its name as a theory was not as well known.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:47.880]   And then it really took off, began taking off when A, they turned our attention from
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.180]   US and Australia.
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:55.320]   So the original writing was really focused on the settler project of the US, you know,
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.440]   in the 17th and 16th century and of Australia in the 19th century and 18th century.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.560]   When they turned our attention more to Israel, it began to pick up more speed.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:08.680]   And then of course, after October 7th, it came to more public prominence because you
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.600]   had people using terminology from the theory that people hadn't heard before.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.960]   Okay.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.880]   I came away not feeling very positive towards this theory.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.600]   I have two reasons.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.080]   Number one is very general.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.860]   It's not specific to this theory, but I think it's an important point just worth emphasizing
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.960]   as you go through your own intellectual journeys and think about the world of knowledge.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.840]   There are two different types of academic theory.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.840]   I put them into these categories, predictive and radical.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.760]   Predictive theory, this is like the traditional notion of a theory.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.980]   There's some phenomenon you're trying to explain.
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:55.680]   You come up with a theory that has a mechanism that explains what has been observed, right?
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.120]   This is a plausible explanation for what we have observed.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.400]   So you're trying to increase understanding of like how something works.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.920]   What makes theory effective is it's predictive.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:12.120]   Once you have this mechanism, there's other predictions you can draw from it.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.240]   Well, if this was true, we would also see this or we wouldn't see that.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.780]   And so you can then kind of test these predictions as a way to either strengthen your conviction
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:26.040]   in the theory's effectiveness or to discard the theory, oh, this doesn't work, or to modify
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   the theory.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:34.920]   Oh, let's modify the mechanism because these observations over here didn't match with what
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   would be predicted.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.880]   Now we're used to thinking about this for science, but the same predictive framework
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.300]   holds for theories in other fields as well.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:50.720]   For example, sociologist Max Weber had this sort of well-known famous theory for the capital
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:56.480]   list energy in the U.S., he said, well, this is because it's the Protestant work ethic.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:00.080]   The early U.S., the pilgrims, the early settlers, a lot of these were Protestants and there's
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.480]   like a very specific component to Protestant religion, especially with predetermination
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.080]   that would push like really hard work.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:14.880]   And that explains the sort of economic dynamism of colonial America and onward, right?
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:15.880]   It's a good sounding theory.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.880]   It kind of makes sense.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.680]   It explains what's going on.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.040]   But over time it made other predictions that didn't prove true.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:26.880]   I'm not an expert on this, but then people started looking at other countries around
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.200]   that time that were primarily Protestant, that did not have anything near the same type
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:35.440]   of economic dynamics as the U.S., and then we saw similar dynamics where once we had
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:41.520]   a more religiously mixed population, we didn't see much difference in the dynamics.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:47.440]   We had Catholic immigration wasn't causing these groups in the population were not acting
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.560]   notably different economically speaking.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:53.360]   And so the theory is like largely been abandoned or at least heavily modified by sociologists,
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   right?
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:57.120]   So that's predictive theory at work.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.640]   Radical theory by context has some other elements.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:06.280]   One they try to explain large swaths of human behavior with a single explanation.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:11.600]   Sort of the wider the swath, the sort of more exciting the theory.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.800]   Two, they tend to modify information they encounter to fit the desired conclusion as
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.320]   opposed to modifying their conclusions to fit the observed information.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.040]   That's a radical theory does that.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:30.360]   Three, they tend to propose radical solutions as cure-alls.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.400]   They're often solutions that are kind of impossible, but like, hey, if we could just do this, everything
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400]   would be solved.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.560]   That's where the radicalism comes from, the name radical theory.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.880]   Four, they tend to enforce purity.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.120]   They tend to have structures to enforce purity among their adherents.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:53.600]   So there's a lot of like careful self-observation and ostracization or punishment of insufficient
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:07:00.160]   purity, which is kind of needed because especially when you have these other factors like you
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.840]   having to bend information to fit the conclusion and sort of put some history away, that makes
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.800]   you sort of fragile as a theory.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.320]   So you have to enforce purity.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:15.680]   Typically radical theories include a theory for why people would critique them, a dismissive
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   theory for why.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:22.080]   So if someone critiques this theory, our theory explains they're doing so out of bad motivation.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.000]   So we don't have to take it seriously.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.880]   The classic radical theory of the 20th century, of course, was Marxism, which as it evolved,
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:35.800]   was explaining more and more, especially as you got into sort of the early critical theories
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.780]   of the modern period as well.
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:41.360]   So much was explained by these underlying mechanisms, these economic mechanisms that
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.960]   Marx put out.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.760]   Everything had to be sort of explained and driven by these underlying mechanisms.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.080]   All of sort of human behavior could be explained by these mechanisms.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.920]   All sorts of information was ignored or modified or just outright suppressed, especially once
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.640]   you actually took this theory and made it the foundation of running countries.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.340]   There's a lot of that going on.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.800]   The solutions were radical, obviously, like running a Marxist communist government was
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   a big radical solution.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.680]   We had these big revolutions.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.560]   And finally, of course, there was strict purity enforcement.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.720]   So of course, in the political context, this was actually violent enforcement.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:25.800]   But in the academic context for a while, it was seen as unsophisticated, did not follow
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   these type of mechanisms.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.440]   It's a classic radical theory versus predictive theory.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.400]   As presented by Adam Kirsch, settler colonialism theory is a radical theory.
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:46.520]   It tries to explain basically everything bad through the ongoing impact of the original
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.960]   dispossession of the indigenous and a settler event.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:57.080]   So like everything bad in America stems from the fact that America would dispossess the
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.200]   indigenous people of America with the settlers coming from England.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.880]   It's not seen as a one time thing.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:11.720]   It's seen as the classic phrase from settler colonialism theory is that settling is not
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.760]   a single event.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.440]   It's an ongoing thing.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.680]   So then they explain everything, everything, climate change, income inequality, all racial
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.440]   strife.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:29.280]   Anything that is bad all has to come back to some sort of sustained and ongoing impact
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.200]   of this sort of single particular bad thing that happened so that there's that sort of
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.920]   grandiose large swath myth to it.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:43.400]   As Adam points out, there's huge amounts of just bad history, ignoring information that's
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   inconvenient.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   There's no rigorous scholarship.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   It's a radical theory.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.920]   Just everything gets reshaped to fit this conclusion.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.320]   So that's not a predictive theory.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.500]   That's radical theory.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.960]   The radical solutions, I mean, this is kind of the problem with it.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.160]   Basically the radical solution is decolonization, which actually literally means like in the
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:08.120]   case of the U.S. or Australia, the 350 million people who live in the U.S. basically leaving,
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:13.640]   I suppose, and the remaining Native American population takes back over the country.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   Like, there's no other real solution, just this proposed other than decolonization, which
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.360]   that's literally where there's not, there's no other sort of solution predicted.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:27.760]   And there's a lot of purity restrictions within it, right?
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.440]   So if you're within these circles, everyone has to one up each other with their purity
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.200]   to the decolonization mindset.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200]   Okay.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.520]   So again, I'm separating right now, actually, even the particular, like the subject of the
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.200]   theory is very important.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:51.280]   Like the colonial history of the world is a devastating history.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.640]   So colonialism came out of the broader post-colonialism academic study project, which was like a really
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   important ongoing project to understand when the age of empire was finally dismantled in
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:07.960]   the mid 20th century, to understand like what that had done and what was needed to enforce
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.920]   empire, right?
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.720]   After World War II, we realized, oh, empire is not a good thing.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.400]   Before World War II, we're like, of course, you kind of take over countries or whatever
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.440]   and they make cotton for you.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.080]   After World War II, we're like, whoops, maybe empire's not so great, right?
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.280]   This doesn't lead to good places.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:32.160]   And so like post-colonial studies was necessary and there was a lot of really interesting
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160]   thinking in there.
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.280]   This came out of that, but it's just gotten to like a radical direction.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.200]   And now it's just, at least in my opinion, reading what I've read about it, it's a shoddy
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:47.440]   scholarship and people trying to one up each other with who can be more purely inherent
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.360]   and more radical.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.040]   And I think that's dangerous in general.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.060]   Radical theory, I think, is a dangerous direction for academia to go.
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.880]   So I don't like radical theory in general, right?
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.300]   Studying colonialism is important.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.300]   Colonialism is bad.
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.780]   Confronting it is important.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.780]   Radical theory is bad.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.140]   We can have both of those things be true at the same time, all right?
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:15.560]   So I came away just thinking negatively about settler colonialism theory, divorced from
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:20.600]   the specific content of the theory, but because of its attributes as a radical theory.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.680]   And I don't think radical theory is helpful for better understanding the world.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:27.720]   And I don't think it's helpful for progressivism, meaning progressivism in not the political
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.600]   sense but in the philosophical sense of striving to improve the world, which I think people
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.400]   in academic institutions should be doing.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.240]   All the support implicitly or explicitly from the state to be a professor, like, yes, you
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:43.960]   should be using your brain at least in part to improve the world.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.440]   And radical theory gets in the way of that.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.800]   The other reason, like, I'm specifically suspicious of this theory, and this goes back to what
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.720]   I said before.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:04.200]   I just am suspicious of any theory for which one of the immediate consequences is violence
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.440]   towards Jews.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.960]   Historically, this has never ended up well for that theory, right?
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.180]   I'm not talking about the war in the Middle East.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:18.680]   I'm talking about the three to 500 percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:24.880]   I'm talking about Jewish day schools being shot at, Jews being randomly shot at.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.440]   This happened in Chicago just a few days ago just for being visibly Jewish.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.680]   This is not in Israel.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.320]   This is not the war.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.400]   This is just North American Jews.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.120]   I'm talking about all of the students I hear about on college campuses who are saying,
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.760]   I feel like I have to hide visible signs of my religion.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.840]   Every time in the last 120 years where a theoretical framework led to that, random violence against
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:57.160]   Jews, Jews trying to hide their identity, every single time, the adherence to that theory
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.640]   said, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know what, kind of, you know, look, you've got to break
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.820]   some eggs to make omelets, and they kind of have it coming, and there's this really bad
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.960]   thing that we're attributing to them, or at least some Jews somewhere, and so that's kind
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.920]   of just like an unfortunate consequence.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.040]   Every single time we've gone down that road, it's ended up bad.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.680]   So I just see that as like the alarm system with any theory, the alarm system with any
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.440]   theory, that if that is happening, your theory is probably a problem.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.240]   So that is a general alarm system I have.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240]   Okay.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.080]   Final key point, because if there's anything you come to listen to my podcast for is to
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:35.200]   hear about the Middle East, is I do want to make very clear when it comes to specifically
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.300]   what's happening in the Middle East, most people engaged in debate and protest and discussion
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:47.320]   about the wars in the Middle East could care less about settler colonialism theory.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.440]   They don't know what it is.
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.140]   It's not at the source of what they're thinking.
[01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:58.560]   So it would be intellectually dishonest to try to use the problematic nature of this
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:06.080]   theory, which I think is very clear, to try to, for example, dismiss everyone who is protesting,
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.960]   debating, or arguing against what's happening with Israel and Gaza.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.340]   This is sort of unrelated from that, in that sense.
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:18.480]   You cannot paint everyone on one side with this broad brush any more than, for example,
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:22.980]   you can look at every Israeli and say they all would be comfortable in Netanyahu's right
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:23.980]   wing cabinet.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.980]   Right?
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:30.940]   We're talking about this particular theory, not talking about this much larger conflict
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.540]   that's happening.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:36.480]   But I do think if you are engaged, this is a serious issue that requires serious people
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.580]   making serious arguments and throwing radical theory into the mix doesn't help.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:47.960]   If you are serious about this issue, do not use this particular theoretical framework
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   as your guide.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.020]   If you're a college student and you want to think hard about these issues, that's fantastic.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.400]   Be wary of this theoretical framework.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.300]   This particular theoretical framework is not helping any side of this conflict.
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.620]   This particular theoretical framework, I think, is only going to gum up the works, only going
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:08.820]   to get in the way of serious people trying to do serious work on this serious issue.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.080]   I do not like radical theory in general.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.780]   And so that is kind of my, this is my PSA against radical theory.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:22.260]   And again, the book I read and the things I've read about it are somewhat biased.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.040]   But it's pretty easy to identify the tenets of radical theories when you see them.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:29.340]   So as a scientist, academic, and not somebody who's in the social science, it's easier for
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340]   me to say this.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.820]   I'm just going to say I don't like radical theory.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.500]   I don't like that radical theory.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500]   It's a specific thing I'm saying, but there we go.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.380]   There is my, there's my lecture, Jesse.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.380]   Detailed.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380]   Detailed.
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:44.300]   It was a good book.
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.660]   You should do like a detailed description like that on Creighton's eruption that you
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.780]   read a couple months ago.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:56.380]   I now want to spend 30 minutes, and I actually am equally passionate about this, on how James
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:02.580]   Patterson messed up Michael Creighton's eruption.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.400]   I don't know who the characters were.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:11.860]   I'm 200 pages in this book and they're like, so-and-so, Susan walks in the door.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.180]   I don't know who Susan is.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:15.940]   200 pages in, I don't know who this character is.
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:21.460]   I can't tell you right now the name of a single person from that book.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.460]   You tell me Jurassic Park.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.820]   It's like, oh, you got Dr. Grant.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:24.820]   You got Sattler.
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.260]   You got Malcolm.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.440]   We know these things.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.260]   As soon as I finished that book, I couldn't tell you.
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.260]   It's bad writing.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.260]   It's bad writing.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.260]   All right.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:37.380]   What are the books that I read?
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:39.580]   That breaks the record for the longest I've ever talked about a book.
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:45.660]   I also read The Small and the Mighty by Sharon McMahon.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:48.300]   So Sharon McMahon has a huge social media presence.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.340]   She's a government history scholar.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.740]   So it's surprising and it's fantastic.
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.260]   She has this huge Instagram.
[01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.100]   It's about interesting people from history.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:00.140]   She wrote this book called The Small and the Mighty.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.420]   My publisher sent it to me.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.220]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:09.180]   It's vignettes of historical figures that you don't know, but who lived consequential
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.020]   lives and inspiring lives.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:17.180]   It's divided into sections, divided by kind of categories, and then it follows these figures.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:22.100]   And this is what I think Sharon does, if I understand it properly, on her social channels
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.100]   as well.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.000]   This is like a drawn out version of it.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   So I like that book.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.900]   I saw Ryan Holiday mention it as a reading list as well.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.400]   You guys have the same publisher.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.220]   I think it's what it is.
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:33.780]   It must be a portfolio book.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:42.220]   Then I read Chasing Dreams by Bob Weiss, former head of the Imagineers at Disney.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:43.220]   It wasn't what I was hoping.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.100]   You know I have this weird Disney book obsession.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:52.260]   And so this book came out by the former head of Disney Imagineering.
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.580]   I think what I was hoping, it's not a knock on the book, but I think what I was hoping
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:03.860]   was a lot more about the technical details of how they built these theme parks.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:07.740]   Like what goes into the technical innovations in the building, like the next generation
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.180]   of rides or whatever.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:10.900]   But it was more of a traditional business memoir.
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:15.540]   So it's much more like Bob and where he was going and the people he met and the stresses
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.540]   of the job, which is fine.
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.900]   But I kind of wanted to get into how the Pirates of the Caribbean works, mainly because I was
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.900]   doing my Halloween decorations.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.620]   I was like, yeah, I want to get some techniques.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:27.620]   I want to build some animatronics.
[01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   So it was fine.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.620]   If you're into Disney, it was fine.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.620]   Good business memoir.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.420]   Had an interesting wife, Bob Weiss.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.140]   Then I read The Wave by Susan Casey, huge Susan Casey fan.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.340]   I'd read The Wave a long time ago.
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.620]   I went back and re-read it.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.980]   Great book.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.020]   It's about big waves.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:46.260]   So half of the book is her hanging out with Laird Hamilton and other big wave surfers.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.700]   That's fantastic, sort of like outside magazine adventure writing.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.900]   And the other half is like hanging out with wave scientists and they're kind of interleaved
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:54.900]   together.
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:55.900]   But it was, I love that book.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.820]   And then I read Tribal by Michael Morris.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.140]   This was an interesting book.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:12.800]   So he studies tribalism, but not in the sort of, not like a sociological perspective of
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.500]   like the way we talk about tribalism now, but like how our brain is evolved, right?
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.380]   Like how does like the Homo sapien brain deal with tribes and how is that different than
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.820]   other species of humans and how does that affect us today?
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:32.620]   And his big argument, which I thought was nicely contrarian, is that tribalism gets
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.620]   a bad rap.
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:40.140]   He says, no, no, no, the thing that allowed Homo sapiens to succeed over all of these
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:47.500]   other human style, humanid, whatever they call them, a humanid species like Neanderthals,
[01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:52.700]   Homo erectus, like Homo florensis, he's like, what allowed Homo sapiens to succeed is that
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:57.240]   actually we have this capacity to connect with and work with other people at a much
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.340]   broader scale.
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:03.560]   Like we can, Yuval Harari talks about this in sapiens to some degree.
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:09.540]   We can come up with a way to feel like our state, like a million people are all our brothers.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:15.540]   Like we can, we can connect to and work with people at a much larger scale than other species.
[01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:20.860]   Neanderthal is like, I have my band and if someone else comes in, like we're just going
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:21.860]   to eat them.
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:22.860]   Like we're going to kill them.
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:26.140]   I have no ability, chimpanzees are the same way.
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:30.060]   You're not in my band, like, yeah, what, what do we care?
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.620]   Like, we'll just kill you.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   Right.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:39.380]   But, but Homo sapiens could cooperate with people from far away, huge groups of people.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.700]   This allowed us to do things like trading and that allowed knowledge to move and we
[01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.820]   could build up giant cities.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:51.460]   So he's actually saying the Homo sapien tribal instinct is one of compassionate cooperation.
[01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.820]   And so what we should do is leverage that to try to build, get over divides.
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:59.940]   And actually like our, our built-in mechanisms, tribal mechanisms are things to leverage to
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:01.460]   overcome divides.
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.500]   That this idea that our instinct is to quickly draw a line between us and others and to be
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.780]   very suspicious of people who are not in our immediate group.
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.700]   He's like, that's not actually Homo sapiens instinct.
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.860]   We have a huge capacity for greatly expanding who counts as our group.
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.820]   And that it actually, he documents to build what we call tribalism now, like a in group,
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:21.820]   out group.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.620]   It takes a lot of work to try to put up those divides and you have to do a lot of work to
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   try to demonize another side, to, to carefully set them up as being very different.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.820]   Like it's more of the, it takes effort to keep people apart.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.980]   And our default is like, we're much better at connecting.
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:40.220]   So I thought it was a cool contrarian thesis.
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:45.340]   And he's like, so we should leverage in like business and life and politics, leverage this
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:50.580]   fundamental mechanisms of Homo sapiens to like cooperate better, to have teams operate
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:56.180]   better, to overcome like political divides and hatreds, contrarian.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.700]   This is one of these cases where it's like the topic the professor has been studying
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:00.820]   forever.
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:06.340]   So these are always good books when a professor writes their like big book on the thing that
[01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.500]   they've been studying forever.
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:12.580]   So it has that type of energy of like, I've done all of these studies and I'm putting
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.580]   to a book for the first time.
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:16.660]   So that's a pretty good book, Tribal by Michael Morris.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.660]   All right.
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.660]   I think that's it.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.660]   Five books.
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.740]   Maybe this will, this will be our new standard, Jesse.
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:26.580]   I'll give a 30 minute speech on one book every week.
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:32.600]   I have to put on my professor hat occasionally because I always say, please send all hate
[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:37.620]   mail on this to jessie@counselingbird.com, it'll definitely get to me, I'll definitely
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:38.620]   read it.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:39.620]   All right, everyone.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:40.620]   Thanks for listening.
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:46.360]   We'll be back next week with another episode and until then, as always, stay green.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:51.020]   Hey, if you liked today's discussion about protocols for focusing better, you might also
[01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:58.200]   like episode three 11, which is about finding focus in distracting times, given that this
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.300]   video is being released, I think the day before the U S election day, probably a good one
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   to watch right now.
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300]   So check that out.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.300]   I think you'll like it.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:08.760]   So I thought this was a good excuse to talk about a topic that a lot of you have actually
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:15.300]   written me about in recent days, which is how do you focus during distracting times?
