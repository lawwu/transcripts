[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Well, Easter changes everything.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.680]   We saw that yesterday in episode 822,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.020]   but one of the most fascinating things about Easter
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.480]   is that the theme of resurrection
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.640]   is not something that takes the New Testament by surprise.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.720]   And here to explain these connections on the phone
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960]   is Dr. Don Carson, who was kind enough to join us again
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.120]   to talk biblical theology.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.400]   Our time together is the fruit of our partnership
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.160]   with our friends over at the Gospel Coalition,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.360]   and Dr. Carson is the co-founder and president
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.400]   of the Gospel Coalition, of course.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.120]   He is also the editor of the new NIV Zondervan Study Bible,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.320]   which focuses on biblical theological themes
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.120]   as they develop in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.460]   Dr. Carson, thank you for joining us again
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.840]   to talk biblical theology.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.700]   As we move through various themes in the biblical storyline,
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.360]   it is, of course, fitting today that we close the week
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.320]   by talking about the resurrection
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.440]   as we celebrate Easter on Sunday.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.480]   So take it from here and help us to appreciate
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.120]   the theology of Easter.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.880]   - In this session, we want to consider the resurrection,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.800]   first of all, the resurrection of Jesus,
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   and then our resurrection on the last day,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.800]   so that we are in agreement as to what terms mean.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.680]   By resurrection, I do not mean something like
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.920]   living forever in a spirit existence or the like,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.920]   but living again in bodily mode after the body has died,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.600]   coming back from the dead in real bodies,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.720]   but ultimately in transformed bodies.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.760]   Well, let's back off just a wee bit.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.560]   There are lots of passages in the Bible
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.160]   that talk about existence beyond death,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.800]   but there are some passages that talk about resurrection,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.200]   that is bodily existence beyond death.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.800]   Many people think that there are very few such passages
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.040]   in the Old Testament, and certainly they're not as common
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.680]   in the Old Testament as in the New,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760]   but there are more of them than people think.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.040]   For example, in Genesis 22, which is, after all,
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.400]   not very far into the Bible,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   we have the account of Abraham almost sacrificing his son,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.280]   and then God himself provides the sacrifice in Aram.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.900]   Now, that's all that is said.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.200]   Nothing more is revealed about Abraham's motives,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.960]   but a sensible and intelligent inference
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.800]   is drawn on that chapter by Hebrews 11, verses 17 to 19.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.600]   The only way that Abraham could have believed
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.200]   that this instruction came from God to kill his own son,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.320]   his firstborn son, the son in whom God himself had promised
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.880]   that the line would run,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   is that he believed that God had the ability
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.120]   to raise his son Isaac from the dead,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.800]   and that has to be a bodily existence.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.480]   It's not some sort of mystical or ethereal
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   or non-corporeal new life.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   It has to be life from the dead,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.060]   because Isaac would then have to pass on his genes
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.640]   to the next generation and the next generation and so on,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.820]   or the promise would have been invalid.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.160]   In other words, there was already some sort of notion
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.400]   of resurrection and its possibility
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   under the mighty hand of God that was grasped by Abraham
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.480]   right at the beginning of the covenant promises
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.160]   to the Messianic people.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.800]   Then there is a very famous passage in Job.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.840]   I know that there are problems in translating it,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.320]   but I think that the NIV has it right.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.480]   Job chapter 19, verse 25 and following,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.560]   where Job in the midst of his suffering still says,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.920]   "I know that my Redeemer lives,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   and that in the end He will stand on the earth,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.160]   that after my skin has been destroyed,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   yet in my flesh I will see God.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.080]   I myself will see Him with my own eyes,
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   I and not another.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   How my heart yearns within me."
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   If you take that at face value, it's pretty dramatic.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.960]   After his skin has been destroyed,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.120]   he's rotted in the grave,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.720]   yet in my flesh I will see God.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.200]   Not just I will see God, perhaps in some
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.040]   spirit to spirit fashion,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.360]   what is later called the intermediate state,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960]   but in my flesh I will see God,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.200]   which presupposes that the flesh has come back to life.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   I myself will see Him with my own eyes,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   I and not another.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.960]   That is a personal resurrection
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.720]   with a personal resurrection body.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.880]   All of that, it seems to me, is presupposed.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.880]   Then there are passages which use resurrection language
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.240]   but which in the first instance are not talking
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.440]   about physical resurrection,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.000]   but about the restoration of the people of God
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.360]   after they've been swept away into captivity.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.120]   The most famous one of these is Ezekiel 37,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120]   where the prophet has this vision of the valley of dry bones
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.040]   and from this we get the famous Negro spiritual,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.480]   dem bones, dem bones, dem dry bones.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.160]   Now hear the word of the Lord.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   In the vision, the bones are connected
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.520]   but they're still not alive.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.720]   The bones are connected and flesh covers them
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.840]   but they're still not alive
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.960]   until the spirit of God comes upon them
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.840]   and they stand up a mighty army
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.180]   in the valley of what was dried bones,
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.560]   but now it's full of life.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.200]   Now in the context of Ezekiel 37,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   this is an imagery having to do with the restoration
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.440]   of the people to the land
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.680]   after they've been banished by God himself
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.440]   from the land in the exile.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.880]   But the thing to observe is that
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.040]   although it's talking about the restoration,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.880]   the imagery is of resurrection.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.060]   In other words, those who say
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.840]   that the Old Testament saints
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   don't know anything about resurrection,
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.880]   you have to wait for Jesus before you get that,
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.680]   overlook the fact that even though Ezekiel 37
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.360]   is not explicitly talking about resurrection per se
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.040]   in the immediate context,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.880]   the imagery that is used to talk about
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.480]   the return from exile is resurrection imagery,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.020]   which shows that the category is already there
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.900]   in Ezekiel's mind and in the minds of the people.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.680]   And the same is also true in Isaiah 24 to 27
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.120]   and to some extent in chapter 56 as well.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000]   Isaiah 24 to 27,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.340]   these chapters are sometimes called the Isaac apocalypse,
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.160]   where there's a lot of apocalyptic imagery
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.620]   of one sort or the other.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.080]   And in that context in Isaiah 26,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.240]   for example, we read verse 18,
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.040]   "We were with child, we writhed in labor,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.040]   "but we gave birth to wind.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.440]   "We have not brought salvation to the earth
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.160]   "and the people of the world have not come to life,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.340]   "but your dead will live, Lord.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.180]   "Their bodies will rise.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.400]   "Let those who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.320]   "Your Jew is like the Jew of the morning.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.480]   "The earth will give birth to her dead."
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.100]   Now, the exact flow of thought in those chapters
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.160]   is inevitably somewhat argued about,
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.000]   but even if you conclude that it's talking about
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.880]   return from exile or the like,
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.920]   it's again cast most definitively
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.040]   in terms of resurrection from the dead
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.780]   with the bodies rising from the grave and so forth.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.480]   It's very strong language.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.260]   And then there are certain miracles in the Old Testament,
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.980]   like the resurrection from the dead
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.880]   of the Shunammite widow's son,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   which clearly is a flat-out miracle.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.900]   When you come to the New Testament,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.640]   Jesus himself raises a small number,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.560]   but certain specific individuals from the dead.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.440]   The son of the widow of Nain, for example,
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.240]   he raises that son from the dead
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.820]   as the son is heading out to burial.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.280]   And then there's the remarkable event in John chapter 11,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.960]   where he raises Lazarus from the dead.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   And in that case, the man has been in the grave for four days
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.180]   so that putrefaction has set in.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.480]   There's no way that you can confuse
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.880]   that resurrection from the dead
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.400]   with calling somebody back to life
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.720]   who's simply gone into heart fibrillation,
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.340]   is not really dead after all, and so forth.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.960]   There's decay that has taken place.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.680]   And that's the context in which Jesus says,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.740]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.880]   In other words, just before that promise in John chapter 11,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.520]   Martha confesses her Orthodox faith.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.320]   I believe that there is a resurrection at the end.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.480]   I believe that my brother will rise on the last day.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.200]   And Jesus asks her,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.800]   yes, but I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.120]   Do you believe that?
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.160]   In other words, Jesus is thrusting himself
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.520]   in the center of everything.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.200]   It's not just that there is resurrection on the last day,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.840]   but that there is no resurrection apart from him
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.160]   on the last day.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.480]   He is the one who makes resurrection possible.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.440]   And that's finally demonstrated
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.080]   in the spectacular display of his own resurrection.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.340]   Moreover, his own resurrection is unique.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.920]   You see, if it were not unique,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.600]   you could say that Lazarus was resurrected before Jesus.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.880]   And so he is the ultimate prototype of resurrection,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.560]   or the Shunammite widow's son in the Old Testament
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.460]   is resurrected before Jesus.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.680]   So he's got to be a prototype before Jesus.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.760]   And in one sense, they're images of what will come,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.320]   but they're not the prototype in the sense that Jesus is.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.280]   Because when Jesus comes back from the dead,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.680]   his resurrection,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.720]   though it ties his resurrection body
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.960]   with his pre-death body,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.840]   nevertheless, his resurrection is unique
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.720]   in all resurrections up to that point
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.540]   in that his body has been transformed.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.280]   There's a connection between his old body,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.300]   that is his pre-death body, and his resurrection body,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.760]   in that the stigmata,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.220]   that is the marks of the wounds are still there.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.240]   That's one of the main points of John 20.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.720]   It's not as if a twin was suddenly brought forth
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.760]   or somebody that looked a lot like Jesus,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.320]   or that there was mass hallucination.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.560]   In addition to the regular marks of crucifixion
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.400]   that Jesus had,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.620]   he also had the highly unusual mark of a spear thrust
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.680]   up under his rib cage to pierce the pericardium.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.980]   And thus the resurrected body of Jesus
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.780]   that the disciples see in experience after experience,
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.460]   at least 10 or 11 of them recorded in the New Testament,
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.480]   to one or two, to groups of seven,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.100]   to groups of 10 or 11, and finally to 500.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100]   All of these depict continuity with the pre-death body.
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.100]   That is to say, this is the Jesus who went into the tomb,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.420]   the tomb was empty, and the resurrected body of Jesus
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.580]   is at some level the same as the body that went in.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.940]   This is Jesus, the historical man, Jesus.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.940]   Yet at the same time, he is now in resurrection glory.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.380]   He's in resurrection life.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   And he does things now that he never did before,
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.260]   appearing in a locked room, for example.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.220]   We would say today materializing or dematerializing.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.940]   And in some sense, he exists in another sphere.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.460]   Exactly what the connection is at some sort of scientific
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.620]   or ontological level between his pre-death body
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.980]   and his post-resurrection body, we cannot possibly know.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.820]   Where this is teased out at greatest length
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.740]   is in 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.060]   where Paul draws some analogies,
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.500]   but he himself acknowledges their analogies.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.880]   They're analogies, nevertheless,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.500]   that are meant to tell us something.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.700]   An acorn doesn't look like an oak tree,
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.940]   yet with the death of the acorn,
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.020]   as the shell rots away and the little life
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.700]   that's bound up inside begins to grow,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.940]   ultimately it issues in a mighty tree.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.100]   It's only an analogy, but it's a telling analogy.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.540]   And he speaks of the different glories
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.420]   of different entities, of stars, of the moon,
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.760]   the sun, and so on.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.660]   There are different orders of being.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.140]   And so also he speaks of the resurrection body
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.400]   as being of a different order.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.660]   And there are two or three other passages
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.380]   that are really important for us to understand.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.220]   The passage in John 20 that I briefly mentioned,
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.220]   where there's a huge emphasis on the stigmata,
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.820]   the marks of the wounds on Jesus.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.260]   The stigmata are the things that convince Thomas,
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.660]   who has doubts about the reality of the resurrection,
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.300]   they are the things that convince Thomas
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.580]   that the resurrected Jesus,
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.900]   the resurrection body of Jesus,
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.300]   has genuine continuity with the pre-death body of Jesus.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.300]   This is the wounded, sacrificed, slaughtered Messiah,
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.380]   who now is alive and reigning as Lord.
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.300]   And in consequence, he falls before him and cries,
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.060]   "My Lord and my God."
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.620]   Indeed, there is a lot of emphasis
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.180]   on the demonstration of who Jesus really is,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.940]   the promised one of God, the eternal son of God,
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.500]   the one who is Lord of all,
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.820]   precisely grounded in the historical witness
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.540]   of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.880]   The cumulative evidence that this,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.840]   New Testament of ours,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.800]   which speaks so powerfully and frequently
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.840]   of the resurrection of Christ,
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.880]   is not the result of hallucination
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.440]   or some conspiracy by early Christians.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.120]   The cumulative evidence is very, very strong indeed.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.800]   These Christians were prepared to die
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.120]   for what they had seen.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.720]   "We cannot help but speak of the things we have seen
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.120]   "and heard," they say.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.280]   They take it as a mark of privilege
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.140]   to suffer for this Christ who suffered so much for them.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.600]   This is not people who have talked themselves into it.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.880]   All the records show how slow and low they were
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.040]   to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.280]   But if he has risen from the dead, as they came to see,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.640]   as even Paul came to see in his vision
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.240]   of the resurrected Christ on the Damascus Road,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.600]   if Jesus really has risen from the dead,
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   then he is approved by God.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.280]   He is vindicated by God.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.720]   His death was not to pay for his own sin,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.480]   or else he'd be damned.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   There's no way he'd be vindicated
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.680]   by being raised by God from the dead.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.360]   No, no, he paid for the sins of others.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.120]   And his sacrifice was so acceptable in God's own plan
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.880]   that the vindication is demonstrated,
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.520]   not least in the resurrection of Christ Jesus.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.320]   This establishes him now as the reigning Lord already.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.560]   And all of God's sovereignty is mediated
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   through Christ Jesus, who is the mediator
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.080]   of God's authority in every domain in this age
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.240]   until he has crushed his last enemy.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.720]   And the last enemy to be destroyed, we're told,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.000]   in 1 Corinthians 15, is death itself.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.520]   And all of this hinges on the resurrection of Christ Jesus.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.440]   Another passage that is really quite important
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.920]   is 2 Corinthians 5, verses one to 10,
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.280]   where Paul makes it very clear, it seems to me,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.800]   that his ultimate hope is not simply
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.760]   to die and be with Christ.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.640]   That's a good thing.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.440]   That's something he looks forward to
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.240]   in Philippians chapter one.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.440]   But his ultimate hope is not to be,
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.080]   as he puts it in 2 Corinthians 5, unclothed,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.600]   that is, without a body.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   His ultimate hope goes beyond what Christians
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.400]   have sometimes called the intermediate state.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.640]   His ultimate hope is to be clothed again with a body,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.360]   a resurrection body, a body like Christ's glorious body
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.560]   that will have the capacity to live and work and eat
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.840]   in this terrestrial, renewed earth,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.000]   but also to be in the very presence of God.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.440]   The ultimate hope of the Christian is not simply
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.280]   to be with Christ in some immaterial existence,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.920]   but to have resurrection bodies
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.000]   in a renewed heaven and a renewed earth.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.200]   And all of that then ultimately issues in hope.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   There's a wonderful passage in 1 Peter,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.240]   Peter's first epistle, where we read these words.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.200]   Chapter one, verse three.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.760]   Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.960]   In his great mercy, he has given us new birth
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.160]   into a living hope through the resurrection
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.000]   of Jesus Christ from the dead
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.320]   and into an inheritance that can never perish,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.040]   spoil, or fade.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.320]   This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.360]   who through faith are shielded by God's power
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.880]   until the coming of the salvation
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.160]   that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.480]   In all this, you greatly rejoice,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.680]   though now for a little while,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.240]   you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.480]   These have come so that the proven genuineness
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.120]   of your faith, of greater worth than gold,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.640]   which perishes even though refined by fire,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.840]   may result in praise, glory, and honor
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.880]   when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.800]   Though you have not seen him, you love him,
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.280]   and even though you do not see him now,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.680]   you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.640]   and glorious joy, for you are receiving
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.320]   the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.720]   In other words, we're receiving now already
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.600]   the salvation of our souls,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.440]   but this all issues ultimately in a living hope
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.920]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.960]   into an inheritance that for us too
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.840]   can never perish, spoil, or fade.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.000]   The promise of a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.080]   a home of righteousness with resurrection existence.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.880]   So that although there is in scripture
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.760]   a resurrection to life, that is,
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.200]   a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.160]   and a resurrection to death, to hell itself,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.760]   yet for believers, the confidence, the joy,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.760]   the anticipation, the hope is tied absolutely
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.660]   to their confidence that Jesus rose from the dead
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.000]   after having offered himself to pay for their sins.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.800]   The cross and the resurrection thus tie together
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.240]   as the turning point of the ages
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.080]   on which all of history swings
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.760]   with the new age already dawning now
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.540]   and ready to be brought to consummation
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.040]   when the master himself returns
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.080]   and all of his glorified, resurrected existence
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.560]   on the last day.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.600]   - That is a brilliant summary and a timely word for us.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.860]   Dr. Carson, I thank you and I pray
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.060]   that you have a wonderful Easter weekend.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.860]   - And a wonderful Easter to you too.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.740]   Christ is risen, he is risen indeed.
