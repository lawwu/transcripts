[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.120]   - Today the Supreme Court voted five to four
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.360]   to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.940]   And here to talk about the fallout,
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.800]   we are joined by guest Dr. Don Carson
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.320]   for a special weekend episode of the Ask Pastor John podcast
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   and we will run long this time, about 20 minutes or so.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   Dr. Carson, I wanna get your thoughts on some specifics
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.500]   about what today's ruling means for the church.
[00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.200]   But first, more generally speaking,
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   what would you say to someone who came up to you
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.440]   and asked for your initial thoughts
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   about the SCOTUS ruling?
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.240]   - A lot would depend, to be quite frank,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.500]   on who was asking me.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.880]   If it were an unbeliever in favor of the decision
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.920]   and this sort of thing, then I would say,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.840]   I think that it is not well-grounded
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720]   in the Constitution itself.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.440]   Really, it's taking the 14th Amendment
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.440]   and trying to expand it by appeal to equal rights.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   And it's in some ways a bizarre ruling
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.480]   that probably will do damage on the long haul
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.220]   to freedom of religion in the First Amendment.
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.200]   Kennedy does have a paragraph in there
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.880]   about the importance of religious freedom
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.000]   and this sort of thing,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.580]   but follows it up with a sentence saying
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.460]   that where the exercise of that freedom
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.840]   seems to harm the rights of others,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440]   then government has the right to curtail it,
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   which really means, as far as I can see,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.840]   that he wants the kind of religious freedom
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.960]   that is allowed in church buildings and worship,
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.600]   but not in a broader cultural view.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480]   So on the other hand, if somebody came up
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.080]   and were part of the loony right-wing fringe
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.980]   that is full of hate and raising money
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.080]   and this sort of thing,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.560]   what I'd want to say is don't buy into
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.400]   the secular culture's insistence
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.920]   that this is the inevitability of history.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.760]   We know who's in charge of history.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.640]   On the long haul, the truth will out.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   On the long haul, every knee will bow
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.480]   and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.680]   Short term, there are going to be
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.140]   some difficulties and challenges,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.800]   but this is no time for panic or resentment,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.200]   and it is certainly no time for hate.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.760]   We're still to love our neighbors as ourselves,
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.720]   and that doesn't matter whether they're gay or not,
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.260]   whether they're Muslim or not,
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.840]   whether they're sectarian or secular
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.480]   or fundamentalist or leftish or whatever.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.900]   We're still to be a community of the transformed,
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.740]   of the redeemed.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.660]   We will be courteous, we will be kind,
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.660]   and so somewhere along the line,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.100]   we need to take great pains to make it clear
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.220]   that our views on marriage do not come
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.280]   from within a community that's merely traditionalist
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.960]   or merely old-fashioned,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.740]   or from a community that's driven by hate
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.580]   or judgmentalism, but it's tied finally
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.660]   to what we hold to be revelation from God
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.900]   and how God made us in the first place
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900]   and how marriage is supposed to mirror
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.180]   the relationship between Christ and His church.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.620]   And therefore, regardless of what happens
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.460]   in terms of tax penalties or anything else
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.080]   or being criticized by the left or the right,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.040]   we simply don't have the option to change those values
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.880]   from the beginning.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   It was not so.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.640]   And so our stance must be resolve, determination,
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.520]   perseverance, faithfulness, courtesy, love,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.000]   displaying a better way and recognizing
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   that this is not the first time
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.200]   the church has confronted those kinds of things.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.080]   In Rome in the first century, after all,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.280]   although homosexuality was not, so far as we know,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.480]   hugely common in every sphere of life,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.720]   in some spheres of life, it was very common.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.760]   And especially in the upper classes, it was very common.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.720]   And Christians stood over against that,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440]   just as Christians insisted on the exclusiveness of Christ
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.820]   in a society that had many, many, many ways
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.500]   to God or to the gods.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.840]   And Christianity was black-billed then
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.360]   as being right-wing and narrow-minded
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.500]   and exclusivistic and hate-filled.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.120]   And Christians, by the quality of their living,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.260]   gradually overcame those kinds of things,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.780]   even though it took about three centuries
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.640]   of persecution to get there.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.460]   So what will take place, who's to say?
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.160]   My guess is that there will be a lot of individual things
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.040]   now about taxes and education and exemptions and marriages
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.200]   and what can be allowed and what can't be allowed
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.880]   and whether something's denominational
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.160]   or not denominational and so on.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.840]   All those kinds of things, I suspect,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.400]   are gonna get tested in the courts,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   many of them all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.360]   So we're going to be facing an array of challenges
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.740]   for years to come.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.280]   And how that will all play out,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.640]   well, I'm either a prophet or the son of a prophet.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.080]   What I am sure about is Jesus is Lord.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   This is a time to be faithful and gentle and firm
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.540]   and evangelistic and loving and principled
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.540]   and not driven by malice or hate or condescension or anger.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.180]   But simply to be Christians.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.440]   - Amen, I wanna talk more about religious freedom
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.580]   in just a moment.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.160]   So this Supreme Court ruling today
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.480]   really opens up a big can of worms.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.400]   - Knowingly, in other words, I don't think
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.280]   they're naive about what they've done.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.520]   - Would you say this landmark ruling today
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.080]   marks a new era for the church in America?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.380]   - I'm always nervous about these new era things,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.600]   to be honest, because in some ways,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   this is merely an extension of a change
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   in public perceptions of anthropology, sex, science,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.480]   a lot of things.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.380]   One could say that some of it begins with a pill.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.760]   We could say that some of it begins with Roe versus Wade.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.360]   We could say that some of it begins
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   with the loss of confidence in the heritage
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.520]   of a widely accepted, in some ways, Christian morality.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.800]   So in one sense, this is just one more step.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.320]   Those who have thought of America
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.840]   as being more distinctly Christian than it is
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.680]   will view this as a massive new thing.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.420]   And it is new in certain respects.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.960]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.600]   But it's new only in the sense that state after state
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.120]   after state after state has insisted
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.920]   that gays and lesbians can marry each other.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.080]   And what has happened now is that this has been affirmed
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.660]   by the Supreme Court for the whole 50 states.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.400]   What makes it so desperately new?
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.880]   Well, not much, really,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.060]   except that it's a little more universal.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.840]   So it depends how you look at things.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.240]   You can use it as a marker if you like,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.120]   but there has been a transmogrification of perceptions
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   about sex and anthropology and fertility
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.640]   and family and children and so on
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.840]   that has been going on a long, long time now.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.640]   - Yeah, what would you say to Christians
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.600]   who feel angry right now and who feel betrayed
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.500]   by the courts for today's ruling?
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.120]   (laughs)
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.960]   - I'd be inclined to say
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.400]   you haven't been reading your newspapers.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.240]   - Right, yes.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.320]   - In other words, this was largely predictable,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.840]   granted the decisions of the courts on recent decisions.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.920]   I mean, I can't see how anybody who's well-informed
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.560]   on recent history would be surprised by this.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.120]   Betrayed, that language presupposes
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.600]   that we have always been a deeply Christian country,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.040]   and our history is more complex than that.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.760]   There have been some hugely wonderful Christian values in it,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.080]   but some things of which to be ashamed, too.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.920]   And in any case, the locus of the people of God
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.340]   is not America and it's not Israel,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.920]   and it's not Britain in this new covenant age.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.600]   It's the genuine church of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.640]   And so it really is very important to keep saying
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.440]   that our first allegiance is not to being American
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.760]   or to being Western.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.140]   Our first allegiance is to being Christian or Christ.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   And insofar as a gauntlet is being laid down to say,
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.360]   choose between the Supreme Court and Jesus,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.720]   we'll follow Jesus.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.540]   And then whatever falls out of that in terms of sanctions
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.560]   or opprobrium or difficulty or accreditation
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.520]   or tax exemption or whatever,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.720]   we'll work those things through
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   and try as well and honestly as we can to handle them.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.440]   And if we lose on them, so, the apostles were glad
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.380]   because they were counted worthy to suffer for the name.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.320]   It's just not the sort of thing
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.240]   that is well-answered by anger.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.640]   It's the sort of thing that is well-answered
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.920]   by a certain kind of serenity, confidence in God's sovereignty
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.120]   in his ability to make us stand,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   to be wise, persevering, clear on these matters
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.260]   and eager to teach the new generation growing up
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.680]   in our churches that we're not fuddy-duddy,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.120]   so this is what the word of God says,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.040]   and that's non-negotiable.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.100]   - All right, this ruling hit on Friday,
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.160]   and Sunday is coming.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   If you were to preach on Sunday, what text would you choose?
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.160]   - As it happens, I am preaching this Sunday
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   at a church in South Carolina
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.400]   that probably should remain nameless,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.000]   but it's got two services, and between the services,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.040]   they had asked me to give a public lecture
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.200]   of about 50 minutes on current trends in culture.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.520]   Well, probably in South Carolina after this Friday,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.440]   I can find one or two cultural things to comment about.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.360]   - Yeah, no problem there.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.800]   - So it promises to be an interesting Sunday.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.360]   That in-between one is more of a lecture
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.120]   where I will end up with Acts chapter 17
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   and Paul's address to people
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.720]   who are biblically illiterate in his own day
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.320]   and who have all the reins of power
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.800]   and whose views are very different from his own.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.320]   I will probably end up there.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.400]   For the two morning services,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.960]   I'm simply preaching from one of the parables.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.000]   I've decided not to change the text.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.840]   It's an evangelistic approach,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.600]   partly because although you want to answer wisely
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.760]   and address the current debacle,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.400]   you don't want to set your agenda by SCOTUS decision.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.280]   It's important, but it was predictable.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.800]   It doesn't change much.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.160]   It merely universalizes trends
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.600]   that have been going on for quite some time.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.120]   And so something has to be said,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.520]   and in this case, they've given me an hour to say it,
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   but the regular preaching of the word of God
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.080]   in the morning services, I'm not going to change.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.800]   - That is really good counsel for pastors.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.880]   Back to religious freedoms.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.560]   What do you predict will be the fallout
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.800]   from this SCOTUS decision for religious freedoms in America?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.960]   - I'm not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.920]   I'm not a legal scholar.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   My guess is that there will be fewer threats for churches
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.000]   than for para-church organizations.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.880]   I don't think somebody's going to come down and say,
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.520]   you can't officiate at heterosexual weddings
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.040]   unless you're also going to officiate
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.440]   at homosexual weddings.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.740]   I doubt very much that that's going to happen,
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.840]   precisely because when things are really tightly tied
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.320]   to church, the first amendment is probably still strong
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   enough in the foreseeable future to preclude a decision
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.640]   that would take that away.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.600]   What will be in jeopardy probably sooner or later
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.400]   is tax exemptions of a religious sort.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   And there will probably be more threat for,
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.480]   well, for example, tertiary education institutions,
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.520]   especially if they're independent.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.880]   I suspect that they'll be a little safer
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.080]   if they're tightly tied to a denomination,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.160]   but the farther out you go into the para-church world,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.800]   the Church of Rome will not seem in law
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.440]   to be exactly the same as an independent seminary
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   or an independent Bible college.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.000]   There's going to be a big shakedown before this one's over.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.720]   In the worst possible case,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.000]   the state could eventually bring in legislation
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.920]   that might ultimately be justified by the court
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.040]   that would treat Christian institutions
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.880]   the way Bob Jones was treated over its racism decades ago.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.120]   That is, all financial support would be taken away.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.520]   That's possible, but by no means inevitable or certain.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.840]   Partly it was one institution, whereas in this case,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.000]   there are thousands of institutions,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.440]   and it's not just evangelicals, it's Catholics,
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.680]   it's Mormons, it's Muslims.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.560]   It's a far more complex situation.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.040]   And moreover, if that's the price to be paid,
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.160]   then it'll be the price to be paid.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.920]   What can you say?
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.440]   It should have no bearing on what Christians do.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.560]   That is to say, we follow Jesus, we follow Scripture,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.400]   and we will try to be courteous and respectful,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.360]   but disagree with those who are
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   redefining marriage in this way.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.280]   And it's quite possible that the Lord in his mercy
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.720]   will bring along a change in the pendulum in the culture,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.920]   even possibly reformation that could swing
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.960]   the country in another direction.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.080]   Who knows?
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.440]   I have no idea.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.360]   But as it stands right now, it's hard to imagine
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.960]   that there won't be some shakedown
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.280]   that will affect some Christian liberties.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.040]   Yes, I think that's probably right.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.880]   - Finally, you travel extensively across the world.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.280]   As the international community watches
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.920]   so-called same-sex marriage become
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.440]   the law of the land in America now,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.760]   how is the international community
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.120]   viewing the United States right now?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.400]   And especially from the perspective of the global church,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.760]   what are they thinking?
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.880]   - Well, it depends what country.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.920]   There are Christians in Canada,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.120]   which is farther down the pike than we are,
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.920]   and in Scotland, who look at us somewhat bemused
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.520]   and say, "Why are you making such a big deal of it?
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.080]   "I mean, we've learned to cope with it, why can't you?"
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.320]   And there is a sense in which there are things
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.160]   to be learned by talking to Christians
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.520]   in some of these countries that have gone
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.240]   a little farther down this road than we have.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.560]   What is more discouraging is, oh, countries in Africa,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.960]   for example, I could name, where increasingly
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.160]   American aid has been tied to policies
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.040]   in those African countries that will soften
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.400]   their stances on homosexuality and the like.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.920]   So in other words, aid is increasingly being tied
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.360]   to manipulation of majority world countries,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.840]   adopting our changing moral standards.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.600]   There's something shameful, I think, about that.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.400]   But I'm sure that those who support this decision
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   view this as a way of using our financial power
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.760]   to do what is right.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   So internationally, people are going to look at us
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   out of a framework that will vary enormously
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.640]   from country to country.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.120]   I mean, some countries are really very secular
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.160]   in their outlook.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.960]   Russia's not gonna be affected in the slightest
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.160]   by any of this.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.360]   European countries are moving in this direction
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   or have gone farther than we have in this direction.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   Many countries from which we get aid
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.520]   that are in fact culturally more conservative,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.160]   in some cases, actually more Christian,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.240]   some cases not, feel manipulated by the American government.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   It's a complex set of reactions,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.080]   depending on what country you're talking about.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   The Muslim world will see this as further confirming
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.360]   evidence of America's moral decay.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.040]   Much of the Muslim world thinks of the West
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   as essentially and deeply sleazy,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.760]   and who's to say that they're entirely wrong.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.400]   On the other hand, it has to be said
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.860]   that at least in some of these countries,
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.520]   there is a lot of a double standard that's operating too.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.240]   But it certainly gives grist for the popular press
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.620]   in their own countries.
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.760]   - It does, yeah.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.280]   And just to be clear, you're not just talking about ISIS
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.400]   and radical Islam right here.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.480]   - No, no, it's not just ISIS, but, oh,
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.400]   for example, the Wahhabis or Salafism,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.080]   and just a lot of conservative Sufis and Sunnis
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.160]   view the moral standards of the West
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.100]   as being one of the least attractive elements here.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.640]   They like our technical prowess, and they like the jobs,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.440]   they like the technical skills and the science
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.480]   and this sort of thing, but are frankly appalled
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   at the nudity and the sexual innuendo.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.440]   And I've just come back from two Middle Eastern countries
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.640]   that will remain nameless
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.800]   and turned on their television and so on.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.600]   It's amazing what they block.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   And I have a certain amount of sympathy
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.960]   for what they bleep out and block
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.000]   just because it's sleazy, it is sleazy.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.520]   So this will confirm their perception
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.800]   of American sleaziness.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.840]   - It sure will.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.400]   Dr. Carson, thank you for your time today.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.520]   That was Dr. Don Carson speaking with us from his office
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.960]   at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Illinois.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.280]   Dr. Carson is the author of many wonderful books
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.980]   over the years, and most recently,
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.800]   he served as the general editor
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.200]   of the forthcoming NIV Zondervan Study Bible.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.280]   We'll be talking more with Dr. Carson later this summer
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.520]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.440]   For everything you need to know about this podcast,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.440]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.400]   Thank you for listening to this special episode.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.560]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.600]   We return on Monday with John Piper.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
