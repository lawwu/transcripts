[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.800]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, episode number 18.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.240]   Today, I have a special guest, Paul Merriman.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.920]   Paul is an author, speaker, philanthropist,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120]   a 50-year veteran of the investment industry,
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.080]   and a former guest on Lou Rickhouse's Wall Street Week.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.280]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.760]   of Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.060]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.920]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.520]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) corporation.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.320]   Today, my guest is Paul Merriman. Paul is a Renaissance man.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.960]   He started out in the investment industry in the 1960s
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.560]   as a broker right out of college.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.040]   He has run manufacturing plants.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520]   He has been successful in his own investment management firm.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.680]   And now, he's a successful philanthropist and educator,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.600]   particularly interested in educating young people.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.120]   With no further ado, let me introduce Paul Merriman.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.160]   Welcome to Bogleheads on Investing, Paul.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320]   Well, it's great to be with you, Rick.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.000]   I mean that.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.560]   I've been waiting years to have a chance
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760]   to talk to the Bogleheads.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.280]   When I told the Bogleheads on the bogleheads.org forum
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.080]   that you were going to be my next guest,
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.640]   it immediately lit up.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.280]   And I got all kinds of questions for you,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.680]   most of them investment questions, of course,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.400]   strategy questions.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.960]   Before we get to that, can you tell us
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.120]   something about yourself?
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.880]   Who is Paul Merriman?
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.520]   Well, Rick, I'm a very old man who
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.800]   started working when he was very young
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   and could never stop working.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.640]   And it rarely had to do with money,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.520]   although if you do good work for people,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.800]   you do OK financially, I think.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.120]   And so I had the good fortune at age 40
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.200]   to be able to do what those fire people are working to do,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.800]   and that is to retire at a young age.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600]   But retire certainly didn't mean to quit working.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   What it really meant was instead of educating and then managing
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.200]   money, I could just spend all that time educating.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.120]   I was in the investment advisory business for 30 years.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.840]   During the week when the market was open
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.920]   and markets were going up and down,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.840]   it was always uncomfortable.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   I was always at a certain amount of anxiety
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   because what that market did was going to impact
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   the people I was working for.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.800]   And on weekends, I felt so at ease with the world.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.040]   And then I retired in 2012 and started my foundation
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.640]   and started to educate and write and do videos and podcasts.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.240]   And I never had that same sense of responsibility.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.600]   So I have a good time seven days a week now rather than two days.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.160]   So you are all about education now.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360]   I am dedicated to helping investors, young and old.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.320]   I go from high school all the way up to retired people,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.040]   figure out how to do better with their investments.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.200]   Well, Paul, you and I have a similar background
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.760]   in many ways.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.920]   You actually worked as a broker for a major Wall Street
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.840]   firm back in the 1960s.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.360]   Can you tell us about that experience
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.600]   and how that shaped you for what you did later on?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.400]   Well, I did start young.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.520]   In fact, I started in the industry
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.480]   at a time when they first started hiring young people.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.240]   Before then, they wanted people to be in their late 20s
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   or their 30s.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   But they were hiring college graduates
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.900]   and training them at the New York Institute of Finance.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.960]   I don't know if you went there, Rick,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.160]   but it was a sales course, basically.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.520]   Oh, yeah, no, I went through the broker boot
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.400]   camp at Kidder Peabody, actually.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.200]   Oh, yeah, OK.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.720]   I was with Harris Supplem, which became part of Smith Barney.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.200]   And I learned quickly that the conflicts of interest
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   in that industry are so great that I just could not live
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.760]   with those conflicts of interest.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.840]   And so I was a broker for less than three years
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.080]   and went to do other things because I really
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.680]   couldn't live with what they were asking me to do.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.520]   And I was working for a great firm in many ways.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.200]   But I still didn't like that conflict of interest.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.120]   And many years later, when I'm 40,
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.000]   I have a chance to get back into it.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.240]   But I love the business.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.440]   I love helping people.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.880]   It's just nice to be able to recommend a no-load mutual
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.600]   fund instead of a mutual fund that charges 8 and 1/2%.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.960]   It's nice to be able to recommend an index fund instead
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.880]   of an actively managed fund.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   Those kind of things weren't around in the mid '60s,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.240]   the index fund and no-load funds like we have today.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   A whole different world.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.640]   Absolutely, completely agree.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.080]   That was just getting started when I went into the industry.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.640]   So it has been a real benefit.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.040]   And things have really changed quite a bit.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.960]   We can talk about how the industry has changed
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.600]   so much during the 50 years that you've been in it, if you will.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.240]   But you actually left the finance industry
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.560]   and you went into manufacturing.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.440]   And you became the president and the chairman
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.800]   of a manufacturing company up in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.480]   I mean, could you tell us a little bit
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.200]   about that experience?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.280]   Well, it really wasn't about manufacturing for me.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.560]   I had guided some people to invest in a company.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   I did not much money, but enough that I
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.480]   felt responsible for them.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.920]   And the company was going to go bankrupt.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.480]   And I knew nothing about manufacturing,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.200]   but I had a good relationship with some people
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.560]   in the brokerage industry.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.520]   So the company invited me.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.080]   I offered to do it without any compensation.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.720]   Well, Paul, that almost sounds like a Warren Buffett story
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.400]   in many ways.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.040]   You had guided investors to this particular company that
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.720]   was going bankrupt, and then you stepped in.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   Well, I would hesitate to compare
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.040]   the size of this company with a story about Warren Buffett.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   But in a way, yes, I mean, these people were--
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.680]   many of them were friends.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.280]   And as it turned out, the man who
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.760]   was running the company before I came in to run it
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.480]   did not have a trusting relationship with the bank.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.040]   And the reason I got in was because a friend of mine
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.800]   from a bank said, this is a guy you can trust.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.200]   He doesn't know anything about manufacturing,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   but I think he'll tell you the truth.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.960]   So I went to the people on the floor of the manufacturing
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.680]   company.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.480]   They knew the solutions.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.680]   I didn't.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.600]   I didn't have much choice but to listen to them
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   and keep the creditors at bay long enough
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   to solve the problem and keep them out of bankruptcy.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.080]   And we did.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.640]   And it was very rewarding, not financially necessarily,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.520]   but it was a great experience for me.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.600]   It made me realize I don't want to run a manufacturing
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.480]   company.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.560]   But I also, by the way, Rick, I had a jewelry making equipment
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.320]   and lapidary equipment supply house
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.680]   at one point in my career.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.440]   I did a lot of things before I was 40
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.280]   and actually found a 30-year career that was absolutely
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.680]   the most fun I've ever had.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.320]   Well, once you went into the investment industry back
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.360]   in 1983, I mean, back then there was maybe one index fund
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   available.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.240]   But as you were saying, the no-load funds
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.080]   started coming out.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.080]   T. Rowe Price and a few other companies
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.520]   were available in no-load.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.120]   So what was your strategy back then?
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.480]   And then how did it change over the years?
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.400]   Well, you of course know that in 1983,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.000]   we had just been through about 17 years of markets
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.920]   that went up and back down and up and back down and up.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.000]   And it kind of went nowhere for a long period of time.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.840]   And investors hadn't made much money, if any,
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.680]   because they had been whipsawed and been disappointed
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.040]   and concluded, I'll never invest in the market again,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   that kind of thing that turns buy-in holders into something
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.680]   other than a buy-in holder.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.680]   And I happened to know something about market timing.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.520]   And I thought, well, wait a minute.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.080]   If somebody could help these people navigate
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.040]   these ups and downs in the market,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.840]   maybe they could stay the course.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.880]   Maybe they would have the trust to wait out the declines,
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.160]   knowing that they wouldn't get out at the top
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.520]   and they wouldn't get in right at the bottom.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.240]   But if they could get the majority of the move,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.880]   that would be of value to them and they might actually
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.360]   have a good long-term return.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   So I became a real expert, I think, on market timing
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   and developed a pretty good following doing that.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   And then in about 1993 or '94, we had a lot of our clients
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.000]   who had money with us, but had a lot of money,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.160]   more money elsewhere, and they were using buy-and-hold.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.520]   I think they liked our firm, the way we treated them,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   and they asked if we could provide buy-and-hold as well.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   And in fact, over the years, Rick, a lot of people
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.560]   ended up being half in buy-and-hold and half in timing,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.100]   as I myself happened to be.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.600]   And yet, I know from all of my experience with timing
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.960]   and buy-and-hold, that probably a good 60% of the folks
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.680]   out there could learn how to be a good buy-and-holder.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.160]   Maybe 2% of the folks out there can learn to be
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.440]   a good market timer, because there's no question.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.440]   Market timing, emotionally, tax-wise,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.840]   is the toughest strategy of all,
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.080]   but particularly emotionally.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.040]   - It was a different time.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.520]   Like you were saying, I was actually in college
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.740]   during the 1970s, and I was taking finance courses.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.280]   And I remember one college professor,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.040]   every time we walked in the room, he said,
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.720]   "Hey, look at interest rates now, they're at 11%."
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.360]   And then the next week, "Look at interest rates now,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.520]   "they're 12%."
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.040]   And it was just a completely different time.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.080]   Inflation was going out of control in 1980.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.400]   There was high unemployment.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.920]   And like you were saying, nobody was making any money
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.980]   in either the stock market or the bond market.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.320]   So stocks and bonds were highly correlated,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.280]   and they were both bad.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.560]   Everything was bad.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.060]   And it had been that way for a long time.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.800]   And I can understand where you were coming from,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.920]   that the only way you could hope to make a rate of return
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.480]   when everything is going bad,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.800]   was to try to get in at a better time,
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.360]   and try to get out at a better time,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.160]   and do some sort of a tactical asset allocation.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.320]   And then I can also understand that later on,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   by the 1990s, when the market finally bottomed out
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.200]   and started going up,
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   that you would also have investors who decided
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.440]   that they didn't wanna do the tactical asset allocation.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.400]   At least part of their money,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.440]   they just wanted to do a buy and hold,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.320]   which has worked very well also.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.720]   So I can see where you're coming from.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.080]   But are you still doing that?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.320]   I mean, do you still look at the markets
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.960]   and try to make a determination
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   whether it's time to get out, it's time to get in?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.200]   And if so, what is it that makes you one of the 2%
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.460]   that's able to do it?
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   - Well, the old firm that I sold my firm in 2012,
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.040]   and I did not retain any ownership
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   because I really did not wanna have any conflict of interest
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.560]   as I moved into being an educator.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   But they still do, both buy and hold and timing.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.640]   And by the way, you have a background,
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.200]   I know, with the dimensional funds.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.760]   We certainly never did any timing with dimensional funds
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.360]   or they would have thrown us out.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.280]   So we actually had a good relationship with DFA
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.600]   even though we also did some timing.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   But we use just traditional trend following kinds of timing.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.120]   What made us unique in the '80s
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   is we developed a strategy
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.880]   that focused on asset allocation plus timing,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   just as we did with buy and hold,
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.800]   except you didn't use the timing.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.600]   So we had timing with big and small and value and growth
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.740]   and US and international and fixed income.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:17.640]   But the fact is that you are wrong so often with timing
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.620]   that investors just don't get it.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:27.000]   I think as my recent article focused
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   on this idea of creating better expectations,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.280]   that the expectations for timing
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.620]   are almost always going to be
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.440]   that the timer is going to get me out at the top
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.020]   and get me in at the bottom
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.240]   and I'm gonna make money when the market goes down,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.120]   even though it may only be money market returns,
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.520]   but it's never that easy.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.800]   You know that it isn't that easy with buy and hold.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.200]   - Well, at least I'm not making any kind of a decision.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.120]   I'm not hanging my hat, if you will,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.120]   on my ability to get people in and out at various times.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.660]   I know how difficult that is
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.640]   because when I first came in the industry,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   I did use active managers who made or break me
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.320]   on their decisions.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.360]   I hung my hat on their ability to outperform
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.160]   and when they didn't, I lost clients.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.360]   And one of the reasons I went to buy, hold,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.920]   rebalance of just index funds
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.840]   is because I didn't wanna lose clients.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.200]   I wanted to be able to control what I could control
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.380]   and I was never good at market timing.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.000]   You know, it's so hard.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.680]   You might be able to pick it right when to get out,
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.280]   but now you gotta pick it right when to get back in.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.920]   So difficult.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.420]   But when it's all automatic, Rick, it isn't difficult.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.400]   And when you tell people
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.720]   that you're gonna probably lose money on half of the trades
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.640]   and that many times you're going to get back into the market
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.840]   at a price higher than you last got out,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.120]   when they go through that bootcamp,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.320]   they come away thinking, oh, this guy is,
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.000]   he knows what he's doing.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.280]   No, no, I've never known the future.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   I'm only really good on the past.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.480]   And so if you don't live up to their expectations,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.760]   it is hard, I think, to keep a client positioned
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.580]   in a strategy when there's activity
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.040]   and when you're wrong part of the time.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.080]   I have 10% of my own portfolio
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.840]   in a fund that I started in 1995.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.760]   It's a combination of market timing and leverage.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:57.320]   And in the last 10 years, the last decade,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.600]   it compounded at a little better than 6%.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.520]   Now, how would a person feel
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.100]   about having spent 10 years at 6%
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.640]   when the S&P 500 made twice that?
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.160]   Well, I feel just fine,
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.660]   partly because, one, I know that 10 years
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.140]   is not a meaningful period of time.
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.980]   Well, it is in my life, but not in the life of the market.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.800]   But the previous 10 years,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.440]   when the S&P 500 lost 1% a year almost,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.820]   that fund compounded at over 18% a year.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.500]   So the challenge for investors
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.720]   is to invest in a way, one, that they'll stay the course,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.520]   and two, that whatever's being done with their money
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.960]   fits within whatever their personal bias might be
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.080]   about the market.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.620]   And some people have a bias towards buy and hold.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.580]   Other people, when you sit and talk with them,
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.760]   their bias is really market timing.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.440]   They may tell you, "I don't believe in market timing,"
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.820]   but their bias is to doing something
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.540]   when things aren't going right.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.240]   - As opposed to John Bogle, who says,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.300]   "Don't just do something, stand there."
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.900]   - Yes, and I had 90 minutes with Mr. Bogle
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.780]   back in June of 2017.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.780]   It had a lot of, it had an impact on me.
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.980]   But I want people to stand in the right place.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.200]   That's what I'm trying to get people to do.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.800]   And where John Bogle, God bless him.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.500]   I mean, I love what he's done for the world
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.300]   and my friends and all the people
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.220]   that are paying less in expenses today than they used to.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:56.960]   We had a major difference of opinion
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.900]   about something that I think is of the greatest import
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.360]   in terms of how an investor should think about the market.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.580]   So yes, I want them to stand there,
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.260]   but stand in the right place.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.260]   - And I want you to elaborate on that a little more
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.920]   because I find this very interesting.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.840]   So if you could dig into that a little more,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.660]   what exactly do you mean by stand in the right place?
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.660]   - Well, here's what John Bogle and his Vanguard,
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.020]   what they recommend.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.740]   And by the way, everything I recommend
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.900]   can be done within Vanguard.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.640]   It just might not, well, it won't be done the same way
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.740]   that John Bogle and others do it for people.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.540]   We don't know the future.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.140]   We have faith in the future.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.180]   So we're always preaching at some level.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.140]   But they tell people that if you put your money
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.540]   into the total market index,
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.020]   that you have done the right thing.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:02.160]   Now, I'm not suggesting you've done a bad thing.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.500]   I'm not even suggesting that I think that,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.620]   or that the way I'd suggest to do it,
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.500]   we'll do better 'cause we don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.780]   But I do know this,
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.780]   that when we invest in a target date fund,
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.720]   I love target date funds.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   And what you end up with is a portfolio of equities
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.780]   that are total market, total market US,
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.500]   total market international.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.300]   And what do we get when we get the S&P 500
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.620]   and the total market index?
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.460]   We get a cap weighted portfolio.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:47.460]   That means that almost all of your exposure to risk
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.340]   is in large cap growth.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.380]   I shouldn't say almost all,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:57.380]   but certainly over 50% is in large cap growth.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.700]   And that's not necessarily bad,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.260]   but when we look at the past
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.740]   that the academics have recreated going back to the '20s,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.740]   what we know is, first thing we know that I wanna clear up,
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.300]   is the return of the S&P 500 is virtually the same
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:25.240]   over the last 90 years.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.580]   That the total market index
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.640]   is not turning out a better rate of return,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.020]   or it does not create an expected higher return
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.460]   than the S&P 500.
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.500]   Oh, they'll say they've got small cap
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.380]   and they've got value and stuff,
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.780]   but it's so little that those big companies
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.740]   that are in there because it's cap weighted,
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.100]   they just walk all over the small cap companies
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.900]   in terms of impact on the return.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   So what I advocate for is, in the US market,
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.820]   is a simple approach where you would spread the money away,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.980]   not based on cap weighted,
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.360]   but based on asset class weighted.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.380]   And this is not anything I ever came up with, Rick.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.720]   I don't think I've had an original thought in my life,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.340]   but I went through the DFA process as you did,
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:27.540]   and I think they teach you a lot of really good stuff
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.440]   about how investing works.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.220]   And one way to improve earnings,
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.460]   at least looking backwards,
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.460]   is to rebuild the portfolio to have some small
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:48.040]   and some value and some large cap in the US.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.400]   Now, whether you add internationals or not,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.260]   I'd like you to, but you don't have to,
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.180]   to historically get a decent rate of return.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.060]   And what happens is that when you go that route,
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.940]   if you talk in terms of underperformance,
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:13.180]   the large cap driven index funds
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.740]   have produced lower rates of return over time
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:24.640]   than a combination of big, small value growth.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   And the risk, if you look at it over time,
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.520]   it doesn't appear to be any more.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.600]   As a matter of fact, I just did some tables
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.400]   that show the market broken down into decades,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.080]   from the '30s, the '40s, all the way to the last 10 years.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   And I create a lookalike of big, small value growth
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.560]   versus the S&P 500.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.300]   And there are times the S&P 500 is right at the bottom
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.600]   or just off the bottom of all the equity asset classes.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.520]   But the combination is always just kind of floating
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.200]   in the middle, never gets to the top.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.640]   It can never get to the top
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.880]   because it's made up of the asset classes
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.860]   that one of them are gonna make it to the top.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.200]   So it never gets to the top,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.220]   but it also doesn't get to the bottom.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.960]   So my view is one, people will get a better rate of return.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   They'll have more peace of mind and they'll retire earlier.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.560]   They'll have more to leave to others.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.840]   And I'm not recommending they put everything in this,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.040]   but to the extent that they want equities,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   personally, I'd rather see them have it broadly diversified
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.060]   in asset classes than have it basically be one asset class.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.820]   And I asked John Bogle about that.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:56.820]   And he said, "What I'm wrong is that I don't understand
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:02.200]   "the impact on people when they own a portfolio
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.260]   "that has this small and this growth and this value.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.220]   "And those asset classes stink.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.260]   "And the S&P 500, where they should have had their money,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.220]   "is rolling along.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.220]   "And on the other hand, when the S&P 500 doesn't do well,
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.300]   "nobody ever seems to come to the conclusion
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.160]   "that the S&P 500's premium is gone,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.360]   "that it's never gonna make a good return again
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.160]   "like it did in the past."
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.160]   That's because people trust it
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.160]   and they don't think to throw it out of the house
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.460]   like you would a kid you didn't like anymore.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.140]   It's this emotional attachment people have to that.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.100]   Well, people in this country have a bias
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   towards the S&P 500 because they're companies they trust.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.440]   - And what you're really talking about,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.800]   or at least what you're saying
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.120]   that John Bogle was saying here,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.120]   is not that maybe the S&P 500 is the ultimate way to invest.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.260]   He's not saying that.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.860]   What he's saying is that people will tolerate
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.780]   bad performance by the S&P 500,
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.640]   but they won't tolerate bad performance
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.820]   by a slice and dice portfolio
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.140]   that has these other magnified sectors.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.940]   I know you keep calling them asset classes.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.060]   I have a real difficult time
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.320]   calling small value an asset class.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.900]   To me, the asset class is U.S. equity,
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.460]   and that means everything in U.S. equity.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.180]   Small value is a style.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.320]   Value is a style.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.420]   Size, small cap, is a style, if you will.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.460]   So I don't consider them separate asset classes,
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.540]   but that's a different conversation.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.620]   But anyway, it sounds to me like what John Bogle's issue was
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.060]   was that people will accept bad returns
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.580]   when the market is bad, and probably not jump ship.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.420]   But when the slice and dice portfolio is bad,
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.900]   it's an active type strategy, and people will jump ship.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.760]   And so in the aggregate, he doesn't like it.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.460]   Staying in the market is really the key,
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.340]   and the total market fund does that for you,
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.120]   rather than slice and dice.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.100]   Is that what I hear you saying?
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.020]   - You know something, I love,
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.940]   no, I understand what you're saying,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.420]   but you have said something
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.180]   that I guess I would disagree with.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.180]   I don't call it an active strategy.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.220]   I really don't.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.540]   I would say that the S&P 500,
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:53.340]   it is an index
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.400]   that represents large-cap blend.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.200]   Now, I don't know if you'd agree with that,
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.200]   but that's how I see it.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.560]   - No, I think I agree with that,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.720]   that it represents large-cap blend.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.160]   Yes, I would agree with that.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.640]   - If you agree with that, why couldn't you,
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.400]   oh, and that blend is made up of growth and value.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Why couldn't you call a portfolio
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.500]   of all the large value
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   standing on its own large-cap value?
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.380]   Why isn't that, doesn't that have the right
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.780]   to be an asset class,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:37.060]   just like large-cap blend or large-cap growth?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.580]   - Well, hold on, Paul.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.140]   I mean, I didn't say the S&P 500 was an asset class.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.460]   It's an index of large-cap blend,
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.780]   but I didn't call it an asset class.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.780]   To me, the asset class is U.S. stocks, the entire market.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.380]   That's the asset class.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.380]   Now, within there, you could divide it up into value growth.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.180]   You could divide it into industry sectors.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.340]   I mean, there's a lot you can do
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.900]   with the asset class called U.S. stocks.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.900]   So my only question was on semantics.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.580]   I mean, you're referring to these things as asset classes,
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.140]   where it's, to me, the asset class is U.S. stocks,
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.420]   and these are sectors of that.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.860]   That was the only difference.
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.480]   - And the only reason I call them asset classes
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.940]   is because those people at DFA caught me.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.260]   So I really, I see where you're coming from.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.260]   And I think the reason that I reject
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.860]   calling them the U.S. market
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.320]   is because I think then a lot of people might say,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.380]   "I wanna put my money into the U.S. market."
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.100]   And so what it ends up following
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.700]   is probably the total market index.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.700]   - I'd agree with that.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.220]   Yeah, that's about right. - And so I think
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.220]   it's leading them down a path that is going to hurt them.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.300]   And when I say hurt them, I don't mean it's gonna,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.660]   they aren't even gonna know they've been hurt, Rick,
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.340]   because most people I talk to,
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.740]   they don't know what return they've had.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.200]   They know they've done fine.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.980]   They've done just fine, they've made good money.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.900]   They may be 2% or 3% a year below the S&P 500,
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.060]   doesn't matter to them, they're doing fine.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:34.060]   So I think a lot of people that are attracted,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.500]   and by the way, the number of people
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.980]   who are attracted to my website,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.380]   it's in this whole scheme of things,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.420]   it's a very small group of people.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.460]   But these are folks, many cases, engineers,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.300]   or you've seen that in the Bogleheads.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.540]   I'm sure half of 'em are engineers.
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.860]   - Seems that way. - I don't know that.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.200]   (laughing)
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.200]   But I do believe, let me just give you one more example
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.220]   with Mr. Bogle, and he was so kind to me, oh my God.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.420]   He was supposed to give me 60 minutes, and he gave me 90,
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.540]   and he answered every question I had,
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:14.540]   and he gave me advice on how to do a better job for people.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.860]   But I asked him about why would a 21-year-old
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.120]   have 10% of their portfolio in a target date fund
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.900]   in fixed income?
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:32.460]   What I have learned is that when you have 10%
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.620]   of your portfolio in fixed income,
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   based on market returns over the last 90-plus years,
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:45.780]   it will cost you 1/2 of 1% a year.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.740]   Okay, I don't like that, because 1/2 a percent
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.840]   is life-changing over a lifetime.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.820]   So they're sitting with 10% in bonds,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.640]   and I'm thinking, wait a minute.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.820]   I want young people, when the market is in decline,
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.380]   to have all of their money buying lower-priced securities,
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.380]   not less, and 10%, what is 10%?
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.460]   It's not gonna turn a bear market into something
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:22.780]   that is much better than what 90%, I mean 100% would be.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.180]   It's almost meaningless, but here was his response,
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.140]   and it's a good one.
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.380]   What we're trying to do is train them to understand
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.940]   there's a process that includes, over your lifetime,
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.020]   a gentle increase in the exposure to fixed income.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.900]   And so they are showing them how that works,
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.500]   and I'm thinking to myself, okay, that's great,
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.020]   but what would an education do for these people?
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.220]   What if they understood that they aren't gonna protect
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.940]   themselves very much, but it's gonna cost them
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   buying lots of good stuff when the market's down and dirty,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.780]   and et cetera.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.340]   I mean, you know the rest of that story,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.300]   and yet they do that to make that fund
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.060]   something people can last a lifetime with,
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.920]   and I don't argue that they may get there,
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.940]   but I think with some small changes,
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:28.260]   it could make a huge difference in what somebody has
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:33.260]   when they retire, how much they live on in retirement,
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.540]   and how much they leave to others.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.820]   And I'll be dead and buried before I'll know
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.180]   how it worked out.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.180]   I'm just hoping somebody will come to my grave
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.860]   and put a little something, I don't know.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.860]   - Well, okay, so the big difference, it appears,
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:57.380]   between a three-fund bogelhead portfolio,
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.220]   which is the total, just buy and hold,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:05.220]   the US total stock market, the international total market,
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   and the total bond fund, or just do any bond index fund
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.060]   or a CD ladder for that matter.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.340]   I mean, it's just a three-fund portfolio,
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.340]   and what you advocate is twofold, it appears.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:24.340]   Number one, you treat the various styles
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:30.180]   of large, small value, and small cap value
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:37.340]   as different asset classes, and to have an allocation
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.220]   to basically those asset classes.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:46.140]   And the second thing is that you also advocate
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:52.460]   an element of market timing to this.
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.660]   And by the way, I'm going to jump a little bit around here.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.580]   I'm gonna jump to the bogelhead questions,
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.140]   because when I announced to the bogelheads
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.540]   that you were going to be my next guest,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.980]   like I said, it lit up and I had all kinds of questions.
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.180]   So, I mean, one of them asks very specifically
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.900]   about market timing, and this is what he asks,
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   is what do you expect the benefit
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:25.420]   of your portfolio market timing would be
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.980]   compared to buy, hold, and rebalance?
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:32.300]   And then another person asked very similarly,
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.780]   what is the exact buy and sell signals
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.020]   that somebody would use for your market timing portion?
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.620]   So, I want to get into this idea
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.380]   that you brought up earlier about being in the right track
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.500]   and about people who may believe, as you said,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.980]   when you sit down and you actually talk with them,
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.660]   they believe there is some way
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.460]   in which they could benefit.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.980]   - Well, to begin with, what I believe
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:01.860]   starts with my fear of the market.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:06.620]   I believe that it's highly likely
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.620]   that in my lifetime, which isn't all that much longer,
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.460]   that I will live through a catastrophic event.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.820]   Now, when I was young, that didn't matter.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.700]   I didn't have anything, but now I do.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.540]   And I have always, in fact,
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.780]   it's hurt me financially by a lot.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.060]   I've always been too conservative
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.660]   because I've been afraid of a market collapse
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.660]   like we had in '29 to the late '30s.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:44.060]   And so, with that in mind,
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.780]   I'm uncomfortable having too much inequities
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.700]   without some sort of an exit strategy.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.580]   And it's just that simple.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.220]   I'm afraid.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.020]   Now, in my buy and hold portion,
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.580]   and that's half of my portfolio,
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:05.060]   I'm half in stocks, half in bonds.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:09.220]   I'm half in U.S., in the half that's stocks.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.860]   I'm half in international.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.220]   I'm half in small.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.420]   I'm half in large.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.900]   I'm basically a little more than half in value
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.460]   and a little less than half in growth.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:24.780]   It's like I don't believe in anything,
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.620]   but in essence, I believe in everything.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.500]   I'm trying to get the exposure to the market
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.900]   where I've got massive diversification.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.900]   And by the way, investors, if they don't know it,
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:42.020]   should know it according to the academic studies,
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.300]   the more diversified we are,
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.900]   the likelihood is we'll get a higher return,
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.900]   not a lower return.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.300]   You ask about in the timing portion of my portfolio,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.420]   I'm not 50/50 stocks and bonds.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.700]   I'm 70% stocks and 30% bonds.
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.100]   Why more stocks there?
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.780]   Because when you use timing
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.980]   and you sit out part of the time in money market funds,
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.420]   you have at that point, when you're sitting in cash,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.780]   you have less volatility
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.380]   than a person who buys and holds equities.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.420]   So in 1987, and everybody in this industry
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.300]   goes back to some time when they looked really good,
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.060]   but in 1987, we had all of our clients' money
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:33.700]   out of the market about a month
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.420]   before the market crashed in October.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.460]   And it made me, for them, I was a hero.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.780]   - You're famous.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.420]   - And I got on Wall Street Week.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.620]   - I bet you did.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.220]   (laughing)
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.700]   - And you know something?
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.100]   Everybody wanted to make a big deal out of it.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.660]   And I said, wait a minute, I didn't call the market.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.700]   I happened to be out of the market when it collapsed.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.980]   There is a difference.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.460]   But people always looking for gurus.
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.460]   There are no gurus, but the trend following systems,
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.260]   you could use a 100-day moving average.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.540]   You could use a 150-day moving average.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.140]   Then it doesn't have to be something complex.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.180]   You just need something that forces you to get in
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.500]   and to get out.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.460]   And yes, you'll go through whipsaws, et cetera.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.820]   But here's the part I think is fascinating.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.820]   The standard deviation of a 70/30 with market timing,
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:39.700]   70 equities, 30% fixed income,
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.700]   is virtually the same as a 50/50 buy and hold.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:49.440]   Almost exactly the same standard deviation.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.100]   And the returns are very similar as well.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.700]   Now, do they go up and down together?
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.700]   No, in 2008, an all-equity portfolio
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.620]   with these simple trend-following systems
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.820]   that the company used, after fees,
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.940]   they lost 18% or 15%.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:12.000]   It was a relatively small amount.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.980]   And in 1987, I had accounts,
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.220]   actual accounts that were up over 50%.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.940]   That's the good news.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.380]   And then everybody rushed.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:28.320]   In fact, after that weekend, I was on Wall Street Week,
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.200]   or that weekend, actually,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.020]   we got 400 phone calls at my office.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   Looking for, theoretically, our help.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.820]   I mean, we were not prepared.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.100]   But the fact is, the following year,
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.920]   our returns were mediocre.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.240]   And by the way, you and I know something
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.440]   a lot of other people may not know,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.940]   and that is a portfolio from '95 to '99,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.860]   properly diversified, big-small value growth,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.580]   U.S. International, compounded at 11%,
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:07.100]   while the S&P 500 compounded at over 28%.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:10.020]   That's the way it is.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.020]   - Well, it's also the way
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.260]   that it occurred in the last five years,
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.260]   if you look just back to 2014, going forward 'til today.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.860]   So, the market timing strategy that you employ
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.220]   is relatively simple.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.940]   It's a moving average, 100 to 150 days, something.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:29.940]   - Yeah. - What you're saying.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.460]   Now, I wanna go back to one point
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.180]   before I get off the market timing,
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.660]   and that is that you earlier talked about
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.420]   young people should have almost 100%
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   of their money in the market.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.980]   But, so when it comes to market timing there,
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.900]   you mentioned that young people,
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.980]   when the market goes down,
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.780]   they should just work and put more money in the market.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.620]   So, when you're talking about market timing,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.260]   are you speaking about everybody, or you're--
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.100]   - Old.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.260]   - Go ahead. - Old people.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.900]   - Old people, okay, that's what I was getting at.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.580]   - Yes. - Old people, like me and you.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.780]   Well, you're older than me, but yeah.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.140]   - (laughs) Yeah, by a lot.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:07.140]   Yes, it is for people where preservation is important.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:12.020]   But, having said that, as critical as I was
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:16.020]   of the Target Date Fund at age 20,
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.820]   sitting on 10% in fixed income,
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.660]   I've met lots of 20-year-olds and 25-year-olds
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.940]   who have all of their money in fixed income
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:34.300]   because they are afraid of stocks.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.220]   And I'm begging them, just put 20, 30% in equities.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.820]   Let me show you, I've got my favorite table.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.300]   It's called Fine-Tuning Your Asset Allocation,
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.540]   and it shows these different combinations
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.500]   of stocks and bonds over the last 50 years.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   And what you see is, if you just have 20% in equities,
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.900]   it'll kick your return up by about 1.5% a year.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.980]   If you can get up to 30%,
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.620]   you might even kick your return up, I'm sorry.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.740]   It raises it about 1% a year.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:11.140]   If you go to 30, it raises it to about 1.5 or so.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.460]   It depends on what asset class you use
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.100]   in the equity portion.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:17.900]   But I want those young people who are scared to death
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.300]   of the market to just take a little risk.
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:23.780]   I don't want them to have as much money
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.260]   as the target date fund represents
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.340]   'cause it's gonna end up scaring 'em out.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.580]   - Okay, let's go ahead and move on
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.620]   to the second phase of that,
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.660]   which we've done the market timing thing.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.460]   You've differentiated how young people
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.140]   should invest versus old people.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.780]   But now we need to look at the other side,
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.980]   really where I think most of the questions
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.580]   from the Bogleheads have come in.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.100]   And it is with your 10-fund portfolio
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:55.940]   and now your new two-fund portfolio.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.020]   And so this is actually, if you don't mind me saying,
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.860]   or using this phrase, the slice and dice
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.460]   of what you do and what you really believe in.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.500]   Number one, could you talk about the 10-fund portfolio
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.620]   and the complexity of it?
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.980]   And then move then into the two-fund portfolio
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.940]   and how that solves the complexity problem.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.780]   - You betcha.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.500]   So this started maybe 15-plus years ago
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.180]   that I created something.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.940]   I got from DFA, by the way,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.700]   what I call the ultimate buy-and-hold strategy.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.100]   And I was quick to say that it wasn't
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.700]   and necessarily anybody else's ultimate buy-and-hold,
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.980]   but it was the best that I could find
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.220]   without placing any big bets.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.820]   So what I did was starting with a portfolio
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.980]   that's 100% in the S&P 500.
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.580]   Then all I do is I take 10% of that money
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.020]   and I put it into large-cap value.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.620]   And what happens is you make a little more money.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.220]   And then I go the next route, the next step,
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.220]   and I put in 10% of small-cap blend.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.220]   Make a little more money.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.100]   By the way, that little more money
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.220]   is sometimes only 1 or 2/10 of a percent.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.580]   Then I take another step and I take out another 10%
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:20.780]   from the S&P 500 and put it in small-cap value.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.300]   No big bets, no big bets.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.780]   Then I take 10% and I put it in REITs.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:31.140]   Now I have 50% in this combination
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.860]   of five different equity asset classes,
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.540]   50% in the S&P 500.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.580]   I think people would be probably just happy as could be
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.940]   right there if they stopped
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.300]   because they would have made an appreciable increase
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:45.980]   in their return.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.740]   And I tell young people,
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.540]   a half a percent more over your lifetime
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.660]   is truly a life changer.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.220]   So if you just did that,
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.420]   you'd have made a big difference historically.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.660]   Don't know about the future,
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.260]   but historically you would have, okay.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.660]   But I keep going because I do want internationals
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.860]   in the portfolio.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.060]   There obviously are times,
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.180]   I wish I didn't have internationals in the portfolio,
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.820]   but I believe that that diversification
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.900]   is what a person should do
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.540]   if they really want to diversify properly.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.620]   So I take another 10%
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.180]   and go into large-cap blend internationally
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.100]   and then 10 in large-cap value
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:34.260]   and 10 in small-cap blend and 10 in small-cap value.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.980]   And then the last 10 goes into emerging markets.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.380]   So I have a lot of really risky investments
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.780]   in that portfolio.
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.820]   And that is what my retirement looks like
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.420]   in terms of equity.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   I do exactly that, 10% each in those 10 asset classes.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.340]   But the bottom line is,
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.900]   for people who are really do-it-yourselfers,
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   trying to rebalance 10 different equity asset classes
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.820]   can be something they can't figure out.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.500]   And when I was a money manager, we had a firm.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.980]   That's what we did.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.100]   We did it for them.
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:22.060]   But Chris Pedersen did this analysis of all the ETFs.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.940]   And he came up with the best large-cap blend,
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.620]   the best large-cap value.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.420]   Every one of those 10 equity asset classes,
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.500]   he made a recommendation.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.180]   My belief is, and you probably know this,
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:40.180]   but supposedly, Schwab is going to be trading ETFs
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.860]   with partial shares.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.540]   Once Schwab is able to trade partial shares with ETFs,
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.380]   or their clients are,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.580]   then there's no reason why they can't let people
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.580]   build a portfolio and have them automatically rebalanced.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.260]   - Moving along then to the two-fund portfolio,
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.940]   which I find to be really interesting.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.820]   So you solve the problem of complexity
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.460]   with the two-fund portfolio.
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:13.460]   - Well, the challenge, and this was, by the way,
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.580]   partly motivated by my meeting with John Bogle,
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:21.780]   because he basically said, "Paul, you're a nice guy."
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.340]   He had been on our radio show for years.
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.580]   So he knew us, and he knew that we were trying
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.540]   to help people.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.020]   He said, "But you've got it wrong.
[00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.820]   "What you're doing with 10 funds
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.140]   "is it's just too complex for people,
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.180]   "and they aren't going to do it."
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   And so Chris Patterson, donating his valuable time
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.340]   as a volunteer to our foundation,
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.860]   along with Daryl Balls, another systems analyst,
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.700]   smart guy that really understands computer work,
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.540]   have put together this strategy.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.340]   And what Chris came up with is the key
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.940]   to treating the extra fund, the second fund,
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:10.940]   in a similar fashion as you would with a target date fund.
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:17.260]   Because if you put, for example, 20% in a small cap value,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:21.140]   and 80% in a target date fund,
[00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:25.420]   and you don't ever reduce the exposure
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.020]   in the small cap value fund,
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.020]   you could end up with 50% of your money
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.700]   in small cap value at age 65.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.540]   - Yeah.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.140]   - So what, and we really want young people
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.820]   to be exposed to small cap value,
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.300]   and then to reduce that exposure as they get older.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:46.860]   And what Chris came up with is so simple.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:51.860]   You multiply your age of 20, let's say, by 1.5.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.740]   Now, you've got 30.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.100]   That is the amount that you would put
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.420]   into the target date fund.
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:02.780]   The rest you put into small cap value.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.700]   Too aggressive?
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.100]   Okay, how about large cap value instead?
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.660]   We could do that as well,
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.020]   but it would just be less aggressive.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:15.540]   So as you age, once a year, you could do it every two years.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:18.300]   I mean, it doesn't have to be done every year.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.700]   But what you're doing, by the time you're 30,
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.060]   you'd have 45% in the target date fund,
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.380]   55 in the small cap value.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.980]   At age 40, you got 60 and 40.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.420]   At age 60, you are 90% in the target date fund,
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.580]   and 10% in small cap value.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.940]   At age 66, you're zero in small cap value.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:42.780]   - Oh, I see.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.620]   Okay, I got it.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.860]   - It is so simple.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.740]   Now, I know what's gonna happen.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.780]   If anybody really thinks this is a good idea,
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.460]   they're gonna reconfigure it and make it better.
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.380]   Because the idea now is there.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.740]   It's a simple thing to do.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.620]   But what formula do you use?
[00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:07.820]   - It sounds like this strategy would work
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.740]   with a young person who's just getting invested
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.620]   in a 401(k) plan,
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.180]   where you've got maybe Vanguard target date funds
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:18.100]   or other target date funds that are available to you
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.820]   and you're 25, or you say you're 30 years old.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.380]   You would also need to have in the 401(k)
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:26.380]   a small cap value index fund.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.140]   If you had those two things available
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.500]   and you wanted to do something more than just target date,
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.860]   and you were more sophisticated,
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.340]   and you really understood what you were doing,
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:36.500]   that this would work.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:40.420]   Because by the time you retire at age 66,
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.460]   you don't have any left in the small cap values,
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.620]   just all in the target date.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:47.340]   So it does make sense from that perspective.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.900]   - And by the way, I work with a lot of people my age
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.820]   suggesting things for their grandkids.
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.100]   When there's a new grandchild,
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.900]   I'm thinking either 100, I'm sorry,
[00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.140]   365 a year for 21 years,
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.580]   or $3,000 once,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.900]   put that in small cap value,
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:10.980]   keep it in small cap value.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.300]   When they start working and they can do an IRA,
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.820]   take money out of this account,
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.100]   put it in the Roth IRA,
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.980]   and just let it go,
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.940]   keep contributing until that money is gone.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.940]   And literally, literally,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:30.940]   if you took 3% off of the compound rate of return
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:34.620]   of the past from small cap value,
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   you could have created 20 million in retirement income
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.980]   and 30 million as a gift to the heirs at age 95.
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:50.180]   Now, obviously it sounds like something
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.540]   that you get at a county fair,
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.780]   but the fact is if you get 12% a year,
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.500]   and why is 12% unreasonable?
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:03.100]   If 10% in the S&P 500 is reasonable,
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.260]   and it includes the depression,
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.260]   then why isn't 12% reasonable for small cap value?
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:15.060]   It is the premium for taking that risk.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.020]   - I have to tell you that one of the Bogleheads
[00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:19.820]   suggested that I get a glass of wine
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.340]   and I put it in front of me.
[00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.780]   And every time you say small cap value,
[00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.180]   I have to take a sip.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.580]   So that's exactly what I did, okay?
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:32.820]   I went and I filled up a glass of wine
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.420]   with some Cabernet, right?
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.940]   - Oh, we're friends then now.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.460]   - Well, we're getting there.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.040]   And I have to tell you, the glass is now empty.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.740]   Paul, we've been talking for quite a while.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.780]   I wanna get into a few other things before we wrap it up.
[00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.580]   And some of the Bogles are curious
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:53.180]   about just a little bit more about your life.
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.660]   One of the Bogleheads asks,
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:58.700]   what is the greatest mistake that you made
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.740]   that you are willing to talk about
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.100]   that we can all learn from?
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.860]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.400]   Mistakes I made as an investor, I lost everything.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.380]   I was conned.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.940]   I shouldn't say I was conned.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:18.260]   I was talked into putting my original investment
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.440]   of $1,000 into a commodity trade,
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   which I doubled in a matter of weeks.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.260]   And having found out how easy that is,
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.200]   I took the guy's advice again, and I lost it all.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:37.220]   And so that money, if I hadn't lost it,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.460]   if I had put it into small cap value,
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.780]   ooh, there's another sip.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.380]   - Oh, no, the glass is already empty.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.620]   You're gonna have to let me go back to the bar.
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.380]   - But if you had invested it,
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:51.420]   rather than having it leak out the bottom
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.700]   in a rush out the bottom of your bale,
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:57.220]   it would have meant something to somebody.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:01.020]   And so I made a lot of mistakes like that
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.980]   early in my career.
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.980]   I invested in some small companies
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:11.200]   that had products that seemed to have some potential.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.660]   Again, I try to talk young people out of doing that.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.060]   Their parents say, "Oh, let 'em make mistakes."
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.060]   I don't wanna let 'em make mistakes.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:23.820]   The cost of those mistakes are way, way more
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.140]   than people know, and they might even get lucky
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.660]   and hit a good one and think they know something,
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.720]   and then it'll even cost 'em more later.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.160]   So I did those things.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:39.540]   And I think the other thing is I've never learned a mistake.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.160]   I'm still struggling with how do I not work
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.440]   60 hours a week?
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.280]   I love what I'm doing.
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.120]   Well, I wanna go as long as I can.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   That's one of the things that John Bogle did for me.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   He inspired me.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.480]   And I'll tell you where I feel my work has value.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.480]   We are giving advice, very specific advice,
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.920]   on how to invest if you're conservative,
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.080]   moderate, aggressive.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.500]   I don't mean I talk to you.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.100]   I don't mean I review your situation.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.740]   I mean we give you, if you wanna learn what we believe,
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.260]   then we make it possible for you to know what to do
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.680]   if you believe that.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:26.300]   That's not easy for people to do.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:29.960]   - So Paul, that gives me a great opportunity to ask you,
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.460]   could you tell us about your website
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.100]   and tell us about all the things you're doing
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.020]   and how are you educating people?
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.520]   - Well, first of all, we got free books.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.120]   Probably the best one is entitled
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.360]   101 Investment Decisions Guaranteed
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.960]   to Change Your Financial Future.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.560]   By the way, I quickly tell people,
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.920]   I guarantee it will change.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.080]   I don't know if it'll be better or worse,
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.000]   but I think it'll be better.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.440]   But it's nothing more than best practices.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:02.760]   So that was the beginning when we started the foundation.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.900]   I have portfolios there on our site
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.900]   for Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.120]   and the ETFs, best in class ETFs.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   We have over 400 articles and podcasts there.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:22.080]   We have videos that we've made.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:27.220]   We have a new book coming out in a few months.
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.800]   It is all about $12 million decisions.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:37.120]   Well, actually, half of it is about $12 million decisions.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.040]   And the other half is about two funds for life
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.760]   because I think you can actually do those 12 things
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   and use the two funds for life
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.520]   and take advantage of those,
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.400]   what I call $12 million decisions.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.540]   That book will be free to everybody
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:57.000]   who is on our email list.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.880]   And by the way, if you're not on our email list
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.420]   and you know the book is out,
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.380]   you'll be able to get it free.
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:08.820]   I want to help as many people as I can.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.220]   And I love working for people.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.660]   I love helping people's lives get better.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:17.260]   I do a lot of nonprofit work here on Bamber's Island
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.620]   and getting medical publications,
[00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:23.980]   free medical publications into the hands
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.880]   of physicians in developing nations
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.580]   through an organization called Global Help.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.600]   So I've got other things I'm working on.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.880]   I just can't seem to stop.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.780]   - You're doing a great job for a lot of people.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.440]   You got tremendous respect by the Bogleheads,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:46.280]   tremendous respect from the investment community
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.960]   for providing information.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.000]   Now, everybody doesn't have to agree with you on everything.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.460]   - Oh, I know that they don't.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.640]   (laughing)
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:58.040]   - Well, Paul, it's been wonderful having you on the show.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.920]   And I know that the listeners have all really enjoyed
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.660]   a lot of the conversation we've had today.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.160]   And I'm really looking forward to talking with you again.

[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.340]   (upbeat music)
