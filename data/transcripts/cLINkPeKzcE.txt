[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Lee writes in to ask this,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.320]   Pastor John, as a Christian, I'm often confused
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.520]   on how to respond to God when I sin.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.620]   On one hand, I believe that Jesus paid all my debts,
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.820]   once for all, past, present, and future,
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.360]   so that I don't need to ask for forgiveness
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.660]   when I ask God to restore me and help me to walk with him.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.100]   On the other hand, I feel the need to ask for forgiveness,
[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.680]   that I might be forgiven once again.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.440]   So my question is, should a Christian ask
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   for God's forgiveness every time he sins or not?
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   - Excellent question.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.180]   I've wrestled with it over and over again,
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.200]   over the years, trying to not only think,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.400]   what does the Bible say about it,
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.880]   but what's the best way to talk about it?
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.920]   So let's establish first that the death of Jesus
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.920]   in our place as a substitute is the cancellation
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.660]   of all our sins, not just the past ones,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.960]   when we get converted.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.320]   And the best way to show it would be,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.360]   start with the definition,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.560]   and then go into the New Testament.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.480]   Here's the definition from Psalm 32.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.640]   "Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven."
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.460]   What does that mean?
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.840]   "Whose sin is covered.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   "Blessed is the man against whom
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.900]   "the Lord counts no iniquity."
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.400]   So to be forgiven is to have sin covered,
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.480]   that is, God's not attending to it
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.520]   as a ground of condemnation, and he's not counting it.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.000]   He's letting it go.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.480]   That's forgiveness.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   Now, Paul quotes that in Romans 4,
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.820]   four through eight, like this.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.580]   "Now to the one who works,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.060]   "his wages are not counted as a gift, but as is due.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.680]   "And to the one who does not work,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.920]   "but believes in him who justifies the ungodly,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.760]   "his faith is counted as righteousness."
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.460]   In other words, through our faith, not our works,
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.400]   God counts us righteous.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.460]   And then he quotes Psalm 32,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.400]   "Just as David also speaks of the blessing
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.000]   "of the one to whom God counts righteousness
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   "apart from works,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.180]   "blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.460]   "whose sins are covered.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.100]   "Blessed is the man against whom
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.900]   "the Lord will not count sin."
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.900]   So in Paul's mind, being counted righteous
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   is the flip side of not being counted a sinner.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.980]   And here's the important thing.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.100]   This is a once for all event in Paul's mind
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.640]   that establishes our identity with God once for all.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   We don't drop in and out of justification.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.320]   The declaration of our righteousness happens by faith
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.160]   when we're united to Christ,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.780]   so that as Philippians 3, 9 says,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.700]   "We have a righteousness, not our own,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.580]   "but the righteousness that comes from God through faith."
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.820]   And forgiveness of sins is inextricably connected
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.660]   with that once for all imputation of righteousness.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.380]   Same thing in the book of Hebrews in chapter 10.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.580]   "This is the covenant that I will make with them.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.060]   "I will remember their sins
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.900]   "and their lawless deeds no more.
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.320]   "Where there is forgiveness of these,"
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.740]   that is through the death of Jesus,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.980]   "there is no longer any offering for sin."
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.820]   So the point there is when Christ dies for sins,
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.820]   the whole sacrificial system stops
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.620]   because that event covers all our sins
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.500]   and there is no need for any recurrent sacrifice.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.380]   So there's a once for allness about it
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.300]   because according to Colossians 2, 14,
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.700]   he canceled the record of debt that stood against us
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.860]   with its legal demands, 2, 14 of Colossians.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.860]   Now, when we put our faith in Jesus, this becomes ours.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.940]   The whole accomplishment becomes ours.
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.460]   Acts 10, 43, "Everyone who believes in him
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.340]   "receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.900]   Gets the whole package.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.020]   And so the question now becomes,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.540]   this is what's being asked,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.100]   should we then pray for forgiveness
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.900]   if we sin as a Christian?
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.700]   Because didn't Christ cover them all
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.780]   so why would we pray for forgiveness?
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.660]   And I'm just gonna go to one place to answer this
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.540]   and that's 1 John because no book is clearer
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.900]   that Christians do sin and what to do about it.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.700]   So here's 1 John 1, 7, "If we walk in the light
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.980]   "as he is in the light,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.620]   "we have fellowship with one another
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.940]   "and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin."
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.700]   Now notice, that's huge.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.060]   "If we walk in the light,
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.060]   "the blood of Jesus his son is cleansing us from all sin."
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.220]   Well, what's walking in the light mean?
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.800]   Verse eight, "If we say we have no sin,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.940]   "we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.340]   So walking in the light can't mean sinlessness.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.340]   Walking in the light must mean that you are aware
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.940]   when you do sin, you're not blind and dark to it,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.100]   you see it.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.980]   Verse nine, "If we confess our sins,
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.100]   "he is faithful and just to forgive our sins."
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.140]   And he's just said, if we walk in the light,
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.980]   you get cleansed from your sin.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.300]   And now he's saying, if you confess your sins,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.280]   he's faithful and just to forgive your sins
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.260]   and cleanse you from all unrighteousness.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   So confessing sins must be a part of walking in the light.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.580]   So the blood of Jesus continually is cleansing us from sin
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.780]   while we're walking in the light
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.980]   and walking in the light means being aware when we do sin,
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.100]   confessing it and confessing means I admit it,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.780]   I did it, I hate it, I don't want it.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.140]   It's telling the truth about our sin
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.940]   and if we do that, we're walking with God in the light.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.900]   We're not dropping in and out of our relationship with God
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.900]   or light, we are walking in the light.
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.380]   We see our sin as sin, we hate our sin, we confess our sin
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.780]   and thus we are enjoying the promise of verse seven
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.340]   that when we walk in the light,
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.420]   we are being cleansed of our sin.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.820]   So how does John connect the blood of Jesus
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.260]   with our ongoing sin?
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.820]   Seems to me he makes it clear,
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.920]   your sins are forgiven for his namesake,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.660]   once for all, chapter two, verse 12,
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.820]   but here we must walk in the light,
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.020]   go on enjoying the cleansing forgiveness
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.860]   that he has purchased once and for all.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.180]   So what does it mean to go on enjoying like this?
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.780]   It means confessing, not denying,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.580]   agreeing that our sin is there and hating it.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.420]   First John 2, one says, if anyone does sin,
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.540]   we have an advocate with the Father,
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.860]   Jesus Christ the righteous.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.060]   In other words, there is a heavenly
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.660]   and an earthly confession of our sin.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.980]   We confess it and fly to the blood of Jesus that covers it
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.340]   and Jesus in heaven confesses it
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.500]   and applies his own blood to it.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.580]   He's our advocate.
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.380]   He continually takes his finished work
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.020]   and applies it to us day by day
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.580]   as we continually apply his work to us day by day.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.840]   So my answer to the question,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.880]   should we pray for forgiveness of ongoing sins is yes,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.300]   if we mean, Father, I confess I have sinned.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.620]   I am sorry for it.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.420]   I hate to dishonor you in this way.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.180]   Have mercy on me now and cover my sin
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.820]   by the blood of your Son for this is why he died.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.700]   I hold fast to him as my only hope.
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.620]   So when Jesus tells us in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.620]   pray like this, forgive us our debts
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.740]   as we forgive our debtors.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.220]   I think that's what he means.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.820]   I think he means I'm going to the cross for you.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.860]   I will pour out my blood of the covenant
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.420]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.540]   Go to the Father every day,
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.320]   lay hold on what I will purchase for you.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.180]   And if Lee asks, must I confess every sin?
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.020]   My answer is no, because you can't even remember them all.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.540]   You don't know them all.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.540]   Rather, join the psalmist in Psalm 19 and pray like this.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.580]   Who can discern his errors?
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.580]   Declare me innocent of hidden faults.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.840]   Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.420]   Let them not have dominion over me.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.560]   Then I will be blameless and innocent
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.120]   of great transgression.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.700]   - Excellent, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.640]   And thank you, Lee, for the very good question.
